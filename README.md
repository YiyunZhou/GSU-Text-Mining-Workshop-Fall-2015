**Center for Process Innovation Colloquium Series                        
Workshop on Text Mining                       
Presented in Collaboration with the Institute for Insight**


+ Hosted by: [Center for Process Innovation](http://ceprin.org/WP/) in collaboration with the [Institute for Insight](http://insight.gsu.edu/)
+ Location: Room 306, [GSU Buckhead Campus](http://robinson.gsu.edu/about/facilities/)
+ Time: TBD
+ Speaker: [Zhitao Yin](http://bit.do/zyincv)

#### Workshop Focus

The workshop will introduce fundamental text mining concepts including text corpus preparation, word counting, lexicon-based text classification, and topic modeling. It will demonstrate how Python can be used to organize, analyze and visualize user-generated text content.

#### Reading
+ [Natural Language Processing with Python](http://victoria.lviv.ua/html/fl5/NaturalLanguageProcessingWithPython.pdf) by Bird et al., 2009.
+ [Narrative framing of consumer sentiment in online restaurant reviews](http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/4944/3863) by Jurafsky et al., 2014.
+ [Probabilistic topic models](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~blei/papers/Blei2012.pdf) by David Blei, 2012.

#### Workshop Material (will be uploaded at 2:00pm on Oct 29th , 2015)

+ Slides: The [lecture slides]() will cover the basic concepts of text mining. Besides, for each exercise, one team of students is expected to present the reuslts via [exercise presentation slides](http://bit.do/projectslides).

+ Data: The [demo dataset]() and [excercise dataset]() were extracted from [Yelp Challenge Dataset](http://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge). For the sake of demonstration, a small subsample of the complete [Yelp Challenge Dataset](http://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge) is provided. You can get the complete data by filling out [the form](https://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge/dataset) for free.

+ Code: Here are [iPython notebooks](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) for the [demo code]() and the [exercise code]().

#### Post-workshop Evaluation

Please take a few minitues to answer the [feedback questionnarie](https://gsu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_a5G5IOB04dcCGUZ) at the completion of the workshop. The questionnaire will be available during 3:50-4:10pm on Oct 30th, 2015.

#### Some Additional Text Mining Resources
+ [Natural Language Processing by Dr. Dan Jurafsky and Dr. Christopher Manning at Stanford University](https://www.coursera.org/course/nlp) - a good self-paced online course.
