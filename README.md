Presented in Collaboration with the Institute for Insight**


+ Hosted by: [Center for Process Innovation](http://ceprin.org/WP/) in collaboration with the [Institute for Insight](http://insight.gsu.edu/)
+ Location: Room 304, [GSU Buckhead Campus](http://robinson.gsu.edu/about/facilities/)
+ Time: December 4, 2015 (2:00 pm - 4:00 pm)
+ Speaker: [Zhitao Yin](http://zhitaoyin.com)
+ Under the guidance of [Dr. Arun Rai](http://arunrai.us)

##### Workshop Objectives

 + **Concept**: Introduce text preparation, lexicon-based word counting, algorithm-based word counting, and topic modeling.
 + **Application**: Demonstrate how to use Python to apply these techniques to Yelp review dataset.
 + **Experience**: Give students hands-on experience through three exerises during the workshop.
