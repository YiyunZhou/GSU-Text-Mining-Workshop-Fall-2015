## Text Mining Workshop (Fall 2015)

The lecture is designed to introduce students to the fundamental concepts and ideas in quantitative text analysis, and to provide them with hands-on experience. It covers four parts: the preparation of a text corpus for analysis, word counting, text classification (both lexicon-based and classifier-based), and topic models. The lecture will make extensive use of Python as well as other open source software to organize, analyze and visualize text data.  We will use a demo project of the analysis of political social media throughout the lecture to illustrate basic as well as somewhat advanced procedures to implement techniques mentioned in each part. The code of the demo project will be uploaded to the Github repository designed for the lecture. Students are expected to use the code creatively to finish the problem sets based on Yelp data set after each lecture.
