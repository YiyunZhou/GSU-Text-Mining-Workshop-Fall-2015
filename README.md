Center for Process Innovation Colloquium Series                             
Workshop on Text Mining               
Presented in Collaboration with the Institute for Insight 


+ Hosted by: [Center for Process Innovation](http://ceprin.org/WP/) in collaboration with the [Institute for Insight](http://insight.gsu.edu/)
+ Location: Room 306, [GSU Buckhead Campus](http://robinson.gsu.edu/about/facilities/)
+ Time: October 30th, 2015 (2:00 â€“ 4:00 pm)
+ Speaker: [Zhitao Yin](http://bit.do/zyincv)

#### Workshop Focus

The workshop will introduce fundamental text mining concepts including text corpus preparation, word counting, lexicon-based text classification, and topic modeling. It will demonstrate how Python can be used to organize, analyze and visualize user-generated text content.

#### Reading
+ [Natural Language Processing with Python](http://victoria.lviv.ua/html/fl5/NaturalLanguageProcessingWithPython.pdf) by Bird et al 2009.
+ [Narrative framing of consumer sentiment in online restaurant reviews](http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/4944/3863) by Jurafsky et al 2014.
+ [Probabilistic topic models](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~blei/papers/Blei2012.pdf) by David Blei, 2012.

#### Workshop Material (will be uploaded at 2:00pm on Oct 29th , 2015)

+ Slides: The [lecture slides]() will cover the basic concepts of text mining. Besides, for each exercise, one team of students is expected to present the reuslts via [exercise presentation slides](http://bit.do/projectslides).

+ Data: The [demo dataset]() and [excercise dataset]() were extracted from [Yelp Dataset Challenge](http://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge). For the sake of demonstration, a small subsample of the whole [Yelp Dataset Challenge](http://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge) will be provided. For those interested in the complete dataset, you can get the data via [the form](https://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge/dataset) for free.

+ Code: The iPython notebook is an interactive computational environment. in which you can combine code execution, rich text, mathematics, plots and rich media. Here are iPython notebooks for the [demo code]() and the [exercise code]().

#### Workshop Evaluation

Please take a few minitues to answer the [feedback questionarie]() at the completion of the workshop.

#### Some Additional Text Mining Resources
