I've been going to this hospital ever since I was a young woman.  When I was in my late-teens to mid-twenties, I had to have three surgeries done.  I stayed at Magee, and as difficult a period of time that was for me, they helped me get through it, in physical and mental and emotional care.  Their aftercare was wonderful and they were able to refer me to some emotional support, which I desperately needed during this time.

Their ob-gyn services here are second-to-none.  My ob-gyn and my general practioner are both affiliated with Magee.  I wouldn't go anywhere else for my needs!",5
9249,hTxie-E8Ehyx5_RNc2K5Vw,7f7P9SCQgBRSMYXbsnDGDQ,"I am writing an update to Magee Women's Hospital.  My attitude towards them has not changed.  This is still the best place for a woman to get healthcare, especially ob-gyn services.  But it will soon be the tenth anniversary of my second of three surgeries I had to have done.  In looking back, I don't know how I could have had them done anywhere else.

The second surgery was bad enough, the third was even more serious because it involved a life-changing decision.  Instead of being very cold about it, I was given my options and told calmly and with empathy, ""Susan, this has to be done"".  And I'm telling you that despite the difficult choice I had to make, they guided me through the entire process.",5
9250,JLObxwchewESR8jMWULSvA,7f7P9SCQgBRSMYXbsnDGDQ,"I am currently 30 weeks pregnant and go to Magee's Out patient clinic for my prenatal care.  I do love it, but to some extent, I wish I would've chosen a PCP.  

I am always attending my appointments, always on time, and always have a good visit.  Sometimes, that doesn't matter.  Girls come in, some who haven't had care for 3 months or more during their pregnancy, and get to waltz in before me.  I have to PEE for EVERYONE FOR EVERYTHING UNDER THE SUN, sometimes 4 or 5 times before my appointment is over--- a girl can only pee so much!  

Also, Im really sad, because I LOVE my nurse practitioner-- but she doesn't get to be with me when I have my baby-- I get some doctor whom Ive never met, and nurses Ive never met either.  Im a little pissed about that.  Like, I get that they are an out patient clinic, and that there are a lot of babies born, and they would be VERY busy doing the clinic and being present for births,  but don't you think that you could at least find out who's on during the week, I don't care if I have to meet 4 doctors-- it would just be nice to not be going into this room blindly to have a baby.

Also, based on the looks and noises people give me when I tell them where Im delivering makes me nervous--- I WILL be making a birth plan, and if ANYTHING goes wrong, because they do no abide by it I will be making their days hell.  I BETTER not have a terrible experience.",3
9251,dfENRNT-w8xGSmAuOdnPgQ,7f7P9SCQgBRSMYXbsnDGDQ,Wish there was a choice of NO stars.  I was in this hospital for 5 very long days and it was a HORRIBLE experience.  I had a kidney infection and pneumonia and had to spend the first night in ER.  No rooms available.  There was no noise control so sleep was impossible.  Finally got a room the next day only to be kicked out because they shut the ward down over the weekend (!).  Absurd.  All I wanted was sleep - so they put me in a room full of loud visitors (I was supposed to have a private room).  Horrible experience.,1

I can't quite bring myself to terms as to why it takes so long in an emergency room......I watch ER it doesn't take this long.  

So in my delusional state I am in right now, I just look at all the people around, look at the pace of the staff and there is just no EMERGENCY.  Why can't we just change the name EMERGENCY room to the hey let's get a bunch of people together in pain misery and sickness, and call it a circus.  I mean really, this is ridiculous.

I will provide a time frame for this ADVENTURE.

If you are in need of an emergency room....try Presby in Matthews, wait times were half and the folks we met at the pharmacy had a much better outcome than us.

11840,6VAdmBNQhMt814QQqcrrlw,oU38GVk3Kmw7_LOVLSqqwA,"I have been to CMC-Pineville twice with my daughter and also a couple of times to accompany others who needed to visit the ER.

On my first visit, my daughter had sprained her wrist and we went to the ER for an x-ray to make sure the bone was not actually broken.  We were pretty fortunate because we did not have a long wait and all the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful.

Our second visit was for my daughter to have her wisdom teeth removed.  Her oral surgeon arranged everything and gave us all the pre-surgical instructions,  so we just showed up at the appointed time, we filled out the necessary insurance papers and did not have much of a wait before the procedure. Thankfully, the surgery went without a hitch so no overnight visit was necessary. 

The other times I have visited the ER was with a family member and a neighbor -both of which thought they were having a heart attack.  The ER staff certainly does not mess around when someone presents with cardiac symptoms. They took the patients back right away.  On each of these visits, the staff was very friendly and helpful and let me go back to check on the patients. 

The hospital has been clean and not too crowded on my visits here. Based on my experiences, this is well-run hospital that offers a good level of care.  I think it is nice to have the option to go to this full service hospital close to home... for me, I see no need to drive all the way down to the center of town for the ""main"" hospital.",4
11841,4-jdxVi1WJLlIi_8icSBCg,oU38GVk3Kmw7_LOVLSqqwA,"I've been going to this hospital long before it became part of the CMC system. The staff is great especially the nurses, but the amount of time that you have to wait to see a doctor in the emergency room is ridiculous. Tonight my wife drove me over because I was in a great deal of pain from a kidney stone. We arrived about 10pm. I was checked in & after waiting about half an hour I had my vitals checked. I was then shown into a smaller waiting room where I sat till 1am when I told the nurse I was leaving. I was told that I was third in line for a room. I replied that equated to showing up at Firebird's at 7pm on a Saturday night and waiting for a table. The nurse agreed that I would probably be waiting another couple hours. That was unacceptable. They told me that they would give me a note for my boss if I would stay for however long it took. Seeing as I'm self employed that was no incentive and I told them so. They then wanted to pump a bag of saline into me and make me talk to a doctor. Fortunately I had the CT scan in the first hour of waiting. It was definitely the fastest way to have a CT scan without waiting. That was the only positive to the evening's misadventure. Well to be fair the nurse that started my IV line, Cynthia did an excellent job as well. The rest of the time that I spent there showed me that the ER needs a serious refresher course in triage.",2
11842,mSFfJWC0U_Amw-CTfh_0Mw,oU38GVk3Kmw7_LOVLSqqwA,"It seems like every time we come to this hospital recently our satisfaction drops. This time my wife had a gall bladder attack. We waited for approximately 15 minutes in the waiting room before my wife was taken back into the main ER waiting room. 

Apparently they need more beds and have split a conventional room into a double. They have a satisfaction index on one of the walls before the main nurses station in the ER where a thermometer indicates that patient satisfaction is approximately 50%. Pretty sad. Well my wife had an ultrasound and they determined that her gall bladder needed to be removed. She was admitted and the organ will be removed tomorrow.

Everyone has been great so far. We've always been impressed by the quality of the nursing staff. Today there was a very short wait in the ER. We spent about three hours in the ER itself waiting for a bed to open up in the tower. I had to run some errands but when I came back my wife was surrounded by her nurse Rebekah & a parade of folks came by to run various tests on her.

Well the rest of the CMC Pineville experience mimiced the ER experience. The ER doctor wanted to remove her gall bladder so she was given a private room on the 5th floor of the new medical tower. There are plenty of windows that let you see over to Carrowinds & the skyscrapers downtown.

My wife's surgery took about 2 hours & she had 2 days of recovery in her room before I picked her up late Saturday morning. I can't say that the hospital's food is really any good. I definitely know that what the patients are given is marginal at best. However the cafeteria & the little Caribou Coffee Shop really aren't any better. I had a chance to eat at both & wasn't impressed.

I did think it was odd that her surgeon never came out to talk to me after the procedure.",4
11843,9m9uB9Sqe2N9hERHiAXJ5Q,oU38GVk3Kmw7_LOVLSqqwA,"i've used only the LAB here and its always quick and polite. My son i disabled and is a extremely hard stick. once she found a usuable vein he hardly even flinched when she stuck him.

since i live 20 miles south of Charlotte this is more convenient than driving all the way into Charlotte.",5
11844,lY9PT3ED3TAkDsttT1oC0A,oU38GVk3Kmw7_LOVLSqqwA,"So here we are once again CMC, Pineville. (3/8/13) I got home and my wife was doubled over on the living room floor. Our dogs were bouncing around her barking. She said that she thought she had a kidney stone so we drove over to CMC.
The wait wasn't that long at least compared to other waits there in the past. She'd already had her ct scan by the time I'd returned from Caribou Coffee downstairs.  Apparently the cafeteria closes at 7pm. She is now in a room freezing although its at least 75*. We saw the usual parade of people & she was released at 10pm. When we left they had about 75 people in the waiting area.",3
11845,TtEby58YNgiwV7dx2nkw4g,oU38GVk3Kmw7_LOVLSqqwA,"Never thought I'd be writing about a hospital.  My experience started at the ER. Every staff member was friendly and made it a point to ask about me.  I actually moved through this portion of my stay smoothly, except, and I get this, waiting for 3 hours for those who are brought in by ambulance taking precedence, to see a physician.
I had a smooth transition for admittance and was treated very nicely by the observation room staffing.  Ordered tests were administered in a timely fashion.  As always, food quality is a point overlooked by institutions, but my meals were adequate. The restaurant has a pretty good offering and there is a Caribou Coffee for your fix!
This facility is newer than Uptown offerings and since we live close it has become our hospital of choice but hopefully not any time soon again!",4
11846,GZ90CFn6rS7VVp5CSAOSCQ,oU38GVk3Kmw7_LOVLSqqwA,"I went to the Vein Center for a hair removal treatment. I was greeted on time. The procedure took 10 mins - in and out. Clean, nice staff. Beware though if you are more than 5 minutes late, they will turn you away.",4
11847,qyBrHc_bkCiWw4lhxEYKjw,oU38GVk3Kmw7_LOVLSqqwA,"(6/24/2013) Well its time for my 3 year check up to see what the state of my pituitary tumor is. For some unfathomable reason CMC-Pineville wanted me to show up an hour early at the main entrance. There is actually plenty of surface parking this early in the morning so that's a plus. The main waiting area is also empty.

The MRI waiting room features the wide chairs. Some of the chairs have circular tables offset on their left arms.  The room is painted in muted blue and olive green. There is a 47"" LG tv hung in the middle of the wall containing the check in window. There is also an alcove with a coffee maker & bottled water.

I had been sitting behind a column & for some odd reason the tech didn't look into the entire room. I had to move nearer to the door and wait for her to come out again. The MRI is a GE model installed in 2006. Most MRI machines have their own noises that can actually be melodic. This machine actually made my body vibrate. It was strange.

So far it was a five star experience but it was soon time to inject me with the radioactive contrast material. Things started going downhill after the MRI tech & another tech attempted to inject me with the material & instead collapsed my veins in both my arms. They next wanted to try my hands and I refused. I told them to butterfly it into a vein on a forearm. Their response was to stick the needle into my left wrist. The contrast was then pushed into the vein burning its way along. I will never have another MRI done there. Perhaps they knew that they wouldn't be getting excellent reviews of their service as I have not received any surveys to complete.",2
11848,etfjnkW-LEStfkfxbYK0Sg,oU38GVk3Kmw7_LOVLSqqwA,"(8/12/13) It is amazingly difficult to get this hospital to arrange a payment plan to pay a bill. After going nowhere with an automated phone menu and then when reaching a live person, I was told that they do not handle Pineville at that location. So here I am at CMC Pineville waiting for a patient registration representative. I'm pretty sure that it won't be a pleasant experience.

And... drum roll please... I was wrong. I met with a very nice representative named Gladys. She was able to get me enrolled in a program called Access One that lets me pay my bill over a year interest free. We spent about an hour together talking but if you are in a hurry it would probably have taken less time. It was very refreshing to be able to experience great customer service.",5
11849,mk-WpiuhEViwGwySjT3cJw,oU38GVk3Kmw7_LOVLSqqwA,"I went to the ER at CMC Pineville in early January due to intense abdominal and back pain, for which I was diagnosed as having shingles. Although the waiting time in the room was over two hours, the PA assisting me was very courteous and thorough, and I was discharged after four hours (early morning hours). The admitting process was very easy and the instructions they gave to me (as well as a referral to an excellent physician) were easy to understand and very comprehensive, explaining exactly what it was that I had and how to care for it. A week later, they called me to check on my progress and to make sure that I was all right. I've been to several medical centers and ER's in my life but this was the first time one had ever bothered to do a follow-up call. I would definitely go back to CMC Pineville for any emergency medical issue.",4
11850,4h4y7PJgR_Lw0FAXVg9ziA,oU38GVk3Kmw7_LOVLSqqwA,"My daughter was 7 months old and she has severe eczema she's been screaming and crying for hours and scratching her herself nonstop it's a bloody mess. One of the nurse was being kinda rude because I overheard the word morphine I called my husband to make sure that they are not giving my baby morphine. He asked to speak to the doctor I asked the nurse if she could speak to him she basically just brush me off saying ""I don't have time to talk to him "" they got an IV on her and were about to give her doses of Benadryl,Antibiotic and Morphine !!! Both me and my husband strongly disagree because she's a little baby and just because she is screaming her lungs out and has severe skin flares ups does not mean she needs morphine!!!! We were transfer to Levine and the doctor there was also shocked when we told him they were gonna give her morphine.",1
11851,ZY2YAPxT223_AhVNuFrD0A,oU38GVk3Kmw7_LOVLSqqwA,"Terrible treatment.  If you have an emergency do NOT come here.  They have the worst unprofessional staff that is completely unorganized, no sense of urgency, and spend most of their time eating and chatting in the hall.  You will waste 3 hours in the ER bleeding from a head injury and concussion as others keep gerring treatment.  One nurse said ""oh we keep forgetting about you""  WTF!   Go here to die!",1
14887,00VfFQXlIy1dPYmf0DMPaA,81R8SNN9_RfJoMIx3lqNYg,"I came to the Blumenthal Cancer Center after Dr. Higgins was highly recommended.  I have had a less than stellar experience.  He's a gynecological oncologist.  

I had a biopsy done a month ago & no one from Dr. Higgins office bothered to call with the results.  I'm waiting to find out of my pre-cancerous cells have become cancerous and no one will return my calls!  Finally after 2 1/2 weeks a nurse from another Dr in the Center returned my call & read my chart and said I may need surgery.  A week or two goes by, no one from Dr Higgins returns my call about my results or impending surgery.  I finally got a call back to schedule surgery and it's a day before my surgery and I still don't have pre-op instructions.  Still waiting on more phone calls to be returned.  I have yet to talk to Dr Higgins or his nurse about my results.  

After all the stress of just dealing with Dr Higgin's office, he's very conservative in his approach.  He scheduled a colpscopy and then when I came in for my procedure, after paying $40 co pay he says, without even examining me, that he didn't think I needed a colposcopy despite a bad pap he wouldn't check.  Now a year later I have high grade pre-cancerous cells that have been unchecked for a year.  

After this current surgery I'm finding another gynecological oncologist.",2

15713,dyq-MAJcRkfjtB4gatGC0Q,JeZRokQJYf6sV_TF7lm9_Q,"This is pretty nice, to have a forum to gripe about hospital food.  Carolinas Medical is a top notch hospital, I used to go here every time I broke a bone in my childhood days (and that was quite a few times).  The nurses are all very friendly, not too many witches around.  The food is no good!  I don't want to be in the hospital anyways, and when I eat I want that to be comforting.  The macaroni and cheese is dry and not really that cheesy, the bread is cold and the meat-well it probably isn't even meat.  The servers were some sweet older ladies though; they assured me that they go across the street to eat.  I don't blame them.",3
15714,L-xKXvtNAO4XKO_rVIMgoQ,JeZRokQJYf6sV_TF7lm9_Q,"I have to say that CMC-Mercy is very likely my favorite hospital in the area.  It's not easy to find (which might be why I like it).  They don't have a great parking area.  Blink and you will miss it.  But the emergency room is top-notch.  They are hands-down the friendliest people I have ever met in a hospital, and they will call after you've been there just to check in and see how you are doing.  Great care.

Generally the line isn't too bad - my guess is that it's a function of the fact that you can't find the place, tucked in as they are behind Presbyterian hospital.  At first, I figured they were a back entrance to the other hospital or something.  But I'm glad that I did.",5
15715,uaTStZXrop_pdU2fUuKfMw,JeZRokQJYf6sV_TF7lm9_Q,"I've been hospitalized here at least 3 times in ICU for 2 week stretches for severe breathing problems and pneumonia. The first time I was admitted i was stuck in a room the air was set to something like 76 degrees. For someone who is laboring to breathe, coughing continuously to circulate oxygen - this is unbearable. I broke a sweat. When I requested them to turn the thermostat down (I had my own in the room) I was told it wouldn't help because they were moving me to my permanent room shortly. 
4 hours later - I have requested the air to be turned down several times - I'm still in the same room. And I'm being repeatedly told to sit up, it'll help me breathe. Finally, I had to get mean with the nurse - and I'm NEVER mean to medical help. She finally realized that I'd now then been laboring to breathe for over 6 hours, was exhausted, in pain and had no more patience and turned the air down. I didn't get my permanent room til nearly a day and a half later. 
Every other experience there was nearly as bad. Although I have to say that the third and final time I gave them a chance I was sent home after 2 breathing treatments and released. An hour later I was back in the hospital, this time I went to Presby, and diagnosed with walking pneumonia and hospitalized for a week. 
Mercy is a joke and I only suggest going there if you have no choice - like post-mortem.",1
15716,e0u0Njsmac2tABmB0VkvbQ,JeZRokQJYf6sV_TF7lm9_Q,"Until recently, I had actually only been to Mercy for emergency room visits.  I am afraid to say, there have been more than a few of them.  Luckily, not all were mine.  They were however at least kept to the family - it is not like I am picking up people off the street and taking them to the emergency room, at Mercy or elsewhere.

On this visit, I had to get some lab work.  Now I was never a fan of labs.  The mad scientist lab on Movie Macabre, perhaps.  But the type of lab you would have to do in biology?  I was too busy creating (and yes, throwing) spitballs across the room.  Still not the right kind of lab, yet I hope you get the idea how I am not a fan.

The visit starts with the parking.  Mercy has never been strong here - they excel in friendliness, not in convenience.  For the emergency room, you get a nice - almost cozy - parking lot.  For the main entrance, parking is decent, but not particularly close.  Luckily, I scored a ride from some guy in a golf cart.  I am lucky that he did not seem to be a fan of Movie Macabre.  At least, if he is, he was working, and did not have time to 'cart' me to the woods.  Had he done so, I was at least close by - and how far can a golf cart really get before it dies from lack of juice?

Once inside, the main entrance has been redone.  Completely.  It is really quite impressive.  Unfortunately, they have to pay for all of that, and what should be a really simple process of sticking you becomes a rather tedious check-in (including a wristband), a journey to another floor, and waiting, waiting and waiting some more.

Finally I give just two tiny vials of blood and get to leave, without so much as the courtesy of a reach around (or even a ride back to the car via the golf cart).  Then I get the bill.  Lovely.  No wonder they could afford all that remodeling.",3

I spent all day yesterday at CMC Mercy for my step fathers knee replacement.  I couldn't have been more shocked from the experience.  I parked on the far right wing and was greeted within 60 seconds of exiting my vehicle.  I was actually headed down some stairs in the parking area and a gentleman a trash can offered me assistance.  His name was Larry and was extremely kind and pointed me in the right direction.

The staff inside was equally as impressive.  They were very kind to my step father as well as my mother and I as we waited.  Prompt updates were made and the facility was extremely clean.  The DR visited late in the evening and I know he was there for a very long day.  He was very kind and wasn't in and out.  

I'm just floored with the difference this was from hospitals I have been in the past.  I like to avoid the Dr. office at all cost, but if I ever need the services of Mercy, I feel comfort from this experience.",4

I've spent 4 of the last 10 days here with my mom as she has gone through a batteryof test. From admissions to Radiology on the 2nd floor we have been treated with the utmost respect and care. As a care partner not only did they check on my mom and her comfort level they checked to make sure I was okay.

She is very afraid of needles and the doctor worked with her and she was able to perform all of her tasks without any problems.  I liked how clean the rooms were and the nurses were very prompt.  If I have to visit any hospital for anything, I would choose this one.  Lets hope I don't have to worry about that though!",4
16817,hgYSTvbhnbSIOICccya74g,Vmw4amlubvfDnIpkegvKKw,"I have to disagree with these other reviews.  Presbyterian is a joke.  Unfortunately our primary care physician is right around the corner, and affiliated with Presbyterian as well, and so any time they want to order up something that they can't handle in the office, guess where they send us?

To make matters worse, the place is always full (or overfull), always understaffed, and always incapable of handling anything.  The emergency department is horrid, but to make matters worse, it's better than being admitted.

In one of the worst cases of mismanagement ever, what should have been a simple examination - passed from our regular doctor - ended up being at least 12 hours in the emergency room while we waited for a regular room, then several days (yes days) in the hospital itself while they proceeded to run a whopping one test per day.  That's right - one test per day!

The test would usually be run in mid-morning, and the results would come back mid-afternoon, at which point they would try and find someone to interpret the test results, which could take until after dinner, and by the time that happened, it would be night time, and then another test would be ordered for the next day.  It was simply pathetic.

I had to go to Presby for some testing. Nice people, nice volunteers, nice front entrance staff to help you find your way. Better than trying to find your way by yourself.
Like I said, if you have a true medical emergency and you have a preference, go to CMC Main. BUT if you have to come for testing, Presby is pretty good. Like a Yelp 3 Star rating--A-OK.",3
16819,0EWIerOznXsiGM97A9pqIw,Vmw4amlubvfDnIpkegvKKw,"This review only concerns the birthing center (maternity ward), where our daughter was recently born.

The facility is top notch.  The delivery rooms feel like a cross between hotel and hospital rooms, and are designed to be comfortable if you have a really long labor (fortunately, my wife's labor was really brief).

When the baby's born and all the delivery stuff os out of the way, they move the mother and partner (if they're sticking around) to a post birth room, which is even more comfortable and less clinical.

The room service food is pretty decent, and if you go down to the cafeteria, the food can be downright delicious, and is actually a pretty good bargain.

I really can't imagine having been treated better or having had a better facility than we had at Presby.  I know my wife feels the same.  Big shout out to Ashley, our nurse during the 12 hours between checking in and the birth.  She was outstanding.  And a big set of props to Dr. Morris, whose professionalism was matched only by his dry humor.

I did notice that the surgical waiting room was jam packed (due to construction)... but it's nice since the front desk of the waiting room keeps tabs on you and takes your cell phone number down so that you receive updates on your loved one.  When the procedure starts, when it ends, and they organize a conference room that you can meet the surgeon in after everything is said and done with.  You also have to wait for your loved one to wake up in recovery... and they keep you updated on their status as well.

I should preface that I volunteered at this hospital during my high school years and achieved over 400+ hours of volunteering hours [when i thought I wanted to go to medical school].  The hospital itself hasn't really changed too much as far as layout (from what I remember)... just face lifts in certain areas here and there.

The neatest thing is that they play a lullaby over the PA system every time a baby is born.  After hearing the tune more than a dozen times during my short time in the hospital it kind of gives one hope about the future and all that is going on around you.",4
16821,Iy9PC9Kffp35OnL42yoP6w,Vmw4amlubvfDnIpkegvKKw,my wife just had a baby here and the maternity was great everyone was very nice and seemed like the actually cared. there was constantly someone checking on our status and making sure we where comfortable. the food was not bad for hospital food but being there for 4 days made it just uneatable by the 4th day. all the nurses are amazing and the doctors and lactitioners are also amazing. will deff have my other children here if that comes up,4
16822,nHQ2Lo4PQ063ArXE4nb3Zg,Vmw4amlubvfDnIpkegvKKw,"We have had our son here many time in the Orthopedic hospital for surgeries so my review is purely based on the experiences as a parents in with pediatrics.

First the Orthopedic Hospital Surgical part. check ins are usually very quick. the patient holding area is fairly nice and each room does have a TV to keep you occupied while waiting. There is usually a steady entering of people coming to discuss your procedure and answer questions so write them down before you get here, because if you are like me it quickly escapes your memory when they ask if you have any questions. 

The waiting room is very large and has regular size chairs as well as a few small benches. If you have other small children accompanying you then this bench is great for sleepy children. 

the lounge area has 2 tables with chairs if you would want a table for eating or computer. also one table has a few electrical outlets for recharging your cell battery or computer laptop.  They have a free machine that can make different kinds of coffee, hot tea and even hot chocolate. There is also a TV in this area.

The bathrooms are very large but are single file type so gotta wait if in use.

the cafeteria downstairs is renovated and I am sorry that I cant tell you about the food there because it closes at 2pm! after lunch SO if your procedure is scheduled around lunch time then people who are allowed to eat should keep this in mind!

ALSO keep in mind parents that if you are being admitted to HEMBY you may want to move your car from the orthopedic hospital parking deck to the main hospital during the time your child is in surgery. I get lost trying to maze my way through the hospital so I have to walk around the outside. And if you are by yourself at the hospital then you will be walking with your child to their room.

the recovery room is typical, except that the pediatric ""cubbies"" are right next to the automatic door which is very loud when people come in and out.

NOW onto the main hospital:
We have usually always been admitted to HEMBY, which has its own elevator near the parking garage entrance to the hospital, take note that the entrance to the cafeteria is also near here.

Hemby is a very nice place, there is a lot for your kids to do if able, playroom, birds to look at in there little glass houses. the rooms are typically adorned with a DVD player and movies are available to borrow. a fridge and microwave in some rooms too. which is great if you have a small one you cant leave.

Now on this visit we were actually in the NEW Hemby overflow which is accessed by the B elevator located directly behind receptionist in main lobby. These rooms are large and have the sleeper sofa, but down fall is no fridge or microwave. but there is a TV of course with a vcr/dvd player. 

The food service person will visit you on the next food serving time and get your order for the next meals. The menu they give you is the one you will be making choices from for you stay. There is a lot to choose from. and as a parent I enjoyed that I didn't have to leave my child to go hunt food.

the nurses have been awesome and respectful of listening to my instructions for how to care for my son. They are helpful to make sure his pain is under control and get whatever I need. 

FOOD Room served: not so bad! let me say that condiments help a great deal and this hospital uses mainly Kraft products (BBQ sauce, dressings, mayo) in the cafeteria you can get hot sauce, tartar sauce, creamers (flavored). of course salt and pepper.
the mac and cheese is surprisingly great! just a little salt and pepper! The salads are filling. the chicken fingers remind me of Arby's breading. The flank steak with baked potato was edible, a little dry on the meat but hey it was free. The baked herbed chicken breast was also a little dry but very good. Breakfast was the best I think, I had eggs, bacon, sausage and grits. 

Cafeteria- salad bar is paid for by WEIGHT so keep that in mind. they now have sushi available, fruits, pastries and the hot section is per item unless you get the special. (like bacon is 49 cents a slice!). burgers are OK, i usually hit it with some of the seasoning salt used for the fries. which are great when first made. They have pizza, soups and sandwiches and this place opens late hours also. 

Gift shop has a lot to offer, snacks, headache meds, stomach meds, chap-stick. perfume, flowers, nice gifts, books, magazines. and extremely helpful staff.

ATM is located on the first floor but the cafeteria and gift shop do take credit/debit cards so if your card is NOT signed be prepared to show ID, it is their policy! 

So if you should be admitted to the children's sections of the hospital I hope you a speeding recovery and a pleasant experience like I have received many times.",4

My daughter gave birth to my grandson here.  I stayed during the duration.  What a great experience from this perspective!

I love her. Maternity and labor is a tough unit and this is just as clean as ever! My daughter will be here soon...fingers crossed everything goes well.

On a late Thursday morning he was transferred to a rather busy cardiac care department. It was established early that morning that he would need a heart cath & possibly a stint. From 10:30 AM to 6:00 PM, we waited in the small observation room. The nurses were not as pleasant as they were at Presby-Huntersville. The doctor who performed the cath/stint was very nice, however. We were very displeased in the wait time for the cath. The nurses didn't do a very good job keeping us informed of the wait time/delay.

The patient rooms are spacious & the facility was clean.

16828,4c_fYl-o5C5HICKSmaGcyQ,Vmw4amlubvfDnIpkegvKKw,"We did a work tour here for my job so this review is strictly for my cafeteria experience.

Wow. This is not your typical hospital food! 

They have food stations everywhere! Everything from burgers and fries, salad bar and sandwiches to pizza and even sushi! I mean, really?!?! 

I know what you are thinking, hospitals are notoriously known for having crappy food but not here! This food was awesome! I had a grilled chicken breast sandwich. It was wonderful, very flavorful and tender! All my coworkers had something different and I didn't hear any complaints! 

They are currently doing a remodel to the kitchen and bringing in new items so I'm definitely looking forward to that! 

Oh the cafeteria is on the same floor as the maternity ward and they play a lullaby every time a baby is born....how sweet is that!",4
16829,lt-4pMm2GBmFWdL0jZj7Kg,Vmw4amlubvfDnIpkegvKKw,"My first complaint is that the parking for the Emergency Room (sorry, they call it ""Emergency Department"") is on the opposite side of the hospital, over by the main entrance. At the moment, that road is torn up by the lovely folks in the City of Charlotte, so you'll want to go -clockwise- around the hospital after you arrive at the ER thinking there will be parking nearby. But while the main entrance is on the opposite side from the ER, the signage through the ground floor hallways between them is excellent.

Inside, there was what seemed like a very long wait to be in pain but when you're not bleeding or in immediate danger after your triage, even if you've been brought in by ambulance, then you're still going to wait for the more serious patients. That's okay in hindsight, but it still sucks to be hurting and waiting an hour for a bed in the ER.

The staff that helped us was excellent. Attentive and not condescending, they explained what they were doing, what was going to happen and (more or less) how long things were going to take.

And there's a free wireless guest network so that you can Google everything they say to confirm!

While it was a good experience, I sure hope not to go back.",4
16830,7OgAYfOx1WA4f7qRIZdR2w,Vmw4amlubvfDnIpkegvKKw,"We were here to support our sister/daughter during the birth of her twin boys. The babies had to stay in the NICU and the nurses were very nice and helpful.

However, the last thing you want to worry about during this joyous time is paying for parking. When leaving the garage in two separate cars, the first car paid the fee for the one behind and let the parking garage operator know. Despite this, the guy still had the gall to charge the second car again.  Ridiculous!

During a time like this, we shouldn't be upset about getting ripped off. Very unfortunate that this employee ruined our opinion of an otherwise wonderful hospital.",2
16831,q15fHjS2V1V_qedMpQ1Dyw,Vmw4amlubvfDnIpkegvKKw,"This review is for the maternity ward specifically.

I have had 2 children here and it was such an awesome experience both times.  Dr. Morris is the best OB/GYN, hands down.  He delivered our first daughter and even when he wasn't able to deliver our second, he made sure we were comfortable with the other doctor on staff that night (she was also from his practice, Providence Women's Care).

Every nurse we encountered in labor and delivery, the aftercare maternity ward, and the nursery was just amazing.  They even have lactation consultants that come through after you have your baby to answer any questions and to make sure breastfeeding is going well.

The hospital food is much better than most and they offer a lot of different options.

The labor and delivery rooms and the post birth rooms are so great.  They have everything you need which is very helpful if you forgot something in your rush to the hospital.

Overall, I highly recommend this hospital and Novant Health as a whole.",5

Cons - Regular Parking.",4
34898,PI87YMrU5DW4Z67_Y0MjKA,CAD0tKIttOTTgT7TMJa-lQ,"This review is strictly based on being a guest at the hospital. 

This morning, my sister gave birth to my second man baby nephew! She delivered at Good Sam so first thing, I booked it to the hospital to meet the new little man in my life. First up, I arrived to be greeted by complimentary valet. This is for any guest of the hospital and they only work on tips. The valet guys were extremely friendly and whisked my car away! Before I went up to see my sis and her fam, I stopped in for a quick drink in the cute corner cafe. I couldn't help but notice how bright and cheerful it was for being a hospital. They have some of the nicest patios for outdoor seating around and you could almost forget your're in a hospital while sitting there! Next up, I stopped by the gift shop to pick up a little congrats gift for my sis and brother in law. It's a bit overpriced in there, but what can you expect since they know they have a captive audience! 

The maternity rooms are really nice and have huge windows overlooking the mounts to the south. The staff was friendly and helpful. Later on, I took a run down to the cafeteria (note: take the stairs if you can...the elevator is slow!) The cafeteria is cheap and has pretty much everything you can think of ... including donuts! 

In addition, their NICU is awesome and they are connected to Phoenix Children's Hospital, so I know my man baby nephew is in good hands!",4
34899,WLZBHyZuWkHtCMYhKMeeFg,CAD0tKIttOTTgT7TMJa-lQ,"My biggest piece of advice is take your own lunch when visiting or working at BGSMC. The cafeteria is not well laid out, the food is mediocre and very over priced. When you want to pay, the lines are long and be very careful... or you could end up standing in line for 10 minutes only to see a tiny sign identifying YOUR line as the one for nurses and physicians ONLY. Really??",3
34900,J2eSsqIM8YDJpOxaWuzmdw,CAD0tKIttOTTgT7TMJa-lQ,Good hospital. Trauma teams are excellent. There's a reason they filmed a Trauma:Life in the E.R. here. All the nurses on pretty much all the floors are all good. Quite a few gorgeous ones too. Just saying.,4
34901,pispUuymxXIbdsPaQABwjQ,CAD0tKIttOTTgT7TMJa-lQ,"I completely agree with Chris S. Happy pills. Seriously. EVERYONE at this hospital is SO NICE!!! The nurses, the doctors, all of the staff....day and night. My friend is being treated here and has been addmited for various days now, and everyone agrees this hospital has really made this whole situation so much more bearable and less stressful, considering. 

When you or a friend is going through illness or trauma, the last thing you want to deal with is rude and uncaring nurses and doctors. You will NOT experience that here....they are WONDERFUL.

The hospital itself is very nice, it feels modern and clean. There is even a nice ""healing garden"" you or patients can relax and get a little fresh air in. The food isn't that bad considering this is a hospital...I had a nice salad and sweet potato fries one day! Prices are like an airport.....expensive. But at least it's not typical cafeteria food.

Thank you Good Sam for taking such good care of my friend!",5
34902,cMluRQe5H3wzOrLnzgSMhg,CAD0tKIttOTTgT7TMJa-lQ,"Last January I was admitted to Good Sam by my perinatologist for an unknown emergency condition with my pregnancy at only 18 weeks pregnant and I spent 13 more weeks living on strict bed rest in the new axillary OBGYN wing.  My perinatologists said that my pregnancy was very complicated and because I was a HUGE hemorrhage risk, and in too perilous a position to go home, I HAD to stay there night and day, even though I only lived a couple of miles away.  They said I could be compared to a water balloon resting on a bed of nails.  Scary stuff!

It was the most challenging and depressing time of my life.  I couldn't go home to my 3 kids and husband (even though I could *almost* see my home from the parking garage roof), I couldn't prepare for my new baby because I didn't know if either one of us were even gonna make it.  I couldn't be home to prepare a nursery, plan a baby shower, get lunch with my girlfriends, go to work, NONE of that stuff.  It was SO depressing and scary for me.  

Thankfully my team of doctors and surgeons and the wonderful OB (and later the ICU) nurses made my experience as pleasant as possible.   They took care of me physically, mentally and emotionally.  The nurses there are all sweethearts and I adored them, they went out of the way to make me at home.   They treated my husband and children like valued guests, and make the process of my kids visiting me as 'normal' as possible.  That was important to me since my kids were very concerned that I wasn't going to come home to them, and were utterly convinced that their baby sister definitely wasn't going to live.  Thankfully, we BOTH made it home alive thanks to the skilled doctors, surgeons and nursing staff that took care of us both at Good Sam and at the Phoenix Children's Hospital NICU inside of Good Sam that cared for the baby once she was born.

Also, I have to mention that my bedrest room in the OB Axillary wing was HUGE, and that is no exaggeration, it was seriously the biggest hospital room I have ever seen and would easily, comfortably hold a dozen or more visitors.    WOW!!



Now for the cons:

The food was really NOT very good, and I think this is where the hospital truly falls down on service.  I would routinely get bizarre, disgusting meals delivered to me, like a plain dry hamburger with a double helping of steamed carrots, no condiments at all.  WTF?   Or once they sent me a slab of dried up cold meatloaf (no gravy) and two plain baked potatoes, again no condiments.  Again, WTF?   And sadly the cafeteria food is NO better.  The food was greasy, mushy and /or tasteless and WAY, WAY, WAY overpriced.  (My mom spent 4 weeks at St. Joe's a few weeks before I was sent to Good Sam and I could see firsthand that St. Joe's cafeteria is SO much cheaper in comparison.)   Because of the dismal food options my family routinely brought me yummytastic meals from the outside, like Long Wong Hot Wings, Pink Champagne cupcakes from Barb's Bakery, hummus and pitas from Pita Jungle, Mexican food from Juliobertos...you know, yummy stuff.  :)   So for this alone I am deducting one star.

Also there is a VAST difference between the quality of rooms in the old part of the hospital and the newer OB rooms over in the axillary wing.  The difference is night and day, in fact.  The old rooms are minuscule in comparison to the new rooms.  In fact the old tower rooms practically require you to step outside to change your mind.   

But the crappy food and tiny, old tower rooms aside, the hospital is GREAT.  The nursing staff is wonderful and the doctors are all top notch.  I wouldn't have gone anywhere else for the level of care and observation that I needed.  In fact, the staff here is so skilled that I understand from what I was told that, for what my particular condition was, I would have been flown to Good Sam for bedrest and delivery no matter where in Arizona we lived.  It was just random luck that we lived right down the road. 

It is THE hospital to go to in Arizona for an extremely high risk pregnancy.

I will never be able to properly thank everyone who cared for us for those 13 agonizingly loooooong weeks at Good Sam, but I can only hope that giving them a great review will at least steer others to this wonderful facility.",4

Two because - the waiting area is awful! Very few chairs, doesn't seem very clean, crazy people, bathroom is scary, and the vending machines are crazy over priced. The biggest disappointment was the THREE hour wait time. I get that they were busy, but geezus, it's a good thing we weren't dying. 

Four because - the ER staff was awesome! Once we got back to a room to be seen by a doctor everything went super fast and smooth. Jon got a nasty burn at work and they knew he was in pain. They quickly got him some pain meds, cleaned up his foot, sent us home with some meds and wraps, and took care of insurance fast. 

So like I said, there was some bad but there was also some good. 

Our consolation prize was watching the crazy chick who was probably detoxing freak out, highly entertaining, well entertaining until she started to vom, then I was ready to be done with the mess.",3
34907,aPGfDMR43EkdSkXOIR82vw,CAD0tKIttOTTgT7TMJa-lQ,"I had to be admitted for a stomach infection. The 3-day stay was a living nightmare, and traumatic experience.

They rudely wake you up every day at 3am to do blood work. What sadistic monster would conceive of doing this to their patients at such ungodly hour? How completely unnecessary, and when I questioned the reason for the early rise, I only received non-answers and mean stares. 

Their solution to every problem is to give people a pill. And doctors are way too quick to prescribe them . You can't sleep, here's a pill. Well, if I wasn't interrupted 3-4 times a night I would be able to have a good night's sleep without the unnecessary assistance of a sleep hypnotic. 

Do you fell depressed in a hospital? Of course we all do. Here's a pill to you. Instead of treating your patients better, just fill them up with more pills.

Is your stomach hurting? Here's a pill. Of course it'll mask the pain but it will not make the cause of  your illness better. 

This is a teaching hospital that caters mostly to indigents and low-income patients. For people with insurance, such as myself, it was a horrific experience. By the way, I had a strange feeling I was a guinea pig for their students.

Your health is the most precious gift, beware of this hospital as they do not respect you as a human being. Some of the nurses are nice, but there were some that looked at you with extreme hatred. Their night RN supervisor reminded me of Nurse Ratched. She gave me the creeps.

Thankfully, I have only needed to stay in a hospital 3 times in my life. The first 2 times were for giving birth to my children in the late 1970's.  What I've learned from this current experience is that the state of medical care in this country has definitely declined to shocking lows.   

When I asked for a doctor's note to give to my employer, they were curt, dismissive and vengefully would not provide me with one. 

Banner Good Samaritan is by far one of the worst experiences I've had in my life. It has left me shaken to the core.",1
34908,DaR4UkCFjuzZd-V9ZOryGw,CAD0tKIttOTTgT7TMJa-lQ,"The care we received was substandard.  My mother in law was recovering from heart surgery and not doing well. We noticed something was wrong but the nurses kept insisting everything was ok. It turned out she had a UTI that went unnoticed we requested a test for the UTI otherwise it would have never been found until it may have been too late to reverse. 

Then she was given Seroquel to have her calm down against our wishes. This was a psychotropic drug that was unnecessary.

The neighborhood is also not safe and the Valet service closes at 10:00 PM 

We needed to be there for the entire stay ( 24/7 ) to insure she got the care she needed.  She was also dehydrated and the nurses did nothing until we insisted something was done,

The attending doctor was annoyed if we made any suggestions and it wasn't until our cardiologist came in and gave specific instructions that anything got done,

Terrible care, I would not have even given this hospital one star if it wasn't required by Yelp.",1

The only negative was that the Emergency room building as dated compared to the rest of the hospital.  Despite that, all modern looking equipment and supplies.

As far as others commenting on wait time, best to time a visit if possible in the morning on a weekday since most people visit an emergency department in the afternoon or evening after work.  I've learned this the hard way over the years no matter which hospital you go to.",5

I rode my bike home, to ditch my computer and work files, and to make sure it was safe.  Took a taxi to Good Sam, and it took almost the entire taxi ride for my insurance to verify I was headed to an ER that is ""in Network.""  Pretty stresful, but once I walked through the doors, most of that changed.

Sure, there was a lot of painful waiting around in a hallway in a wheelchair.  But, hey, it's an emergency room.  I found the system to be very organized and the employees to be helpful and compassionate.  There were a couple of fails on the doctor's part.  She offered me pain meds, and then forgot to order them.  I had to ask a nurse, and then they arrived quickly.  Doc also forgot to order antibiotics for my road rash, but I received a voice mail shortly after discharge that hooked me up with germ-fighters.
 
When I was discharged, I indicated I intended to walk to Walgreens, since I live in the neighborhood.  I was referred to the hospital pharmacy, which I expected to soak me.  But it only cost me $14 for 2 kinds of pain meds and stool softener (yes, I said it and no, it hasn't worked yet).  Pharmacy gave me a beeper and I was able to peruse the lovely and overpriced gift shop.  If I was hospitalized, there were many items there that I would appreciate receiving.  Good gift shop.

I was there for approximately 4.5 hours.  I had triage, xrays, and an EKG.  I was admitted immediately, no waiting.  I don't have much experience with ERs, so there you go.

(2) During my stay, the post partum nurses were friendly but spent must time chatting/gossiping instead of being attentive to patients IMHO. 

(3) Resident Physicians were not a positive experience. We didn't feel comfortable in their care. Would have preferred not to have dealt with residents.  A Resident also delayed our discharge by hours by not dropping off a written prescription

(4) Billing Office was difficult. They tried to make us pay for our newborn's charges which were different from the mother's charges. Newborn babies are not yet on insurance plans. And since they are not yet on your insurance, the charges are very high as you could imagine. We were not required to pay them before leaving the hospital but they certainly pressured us into paying. We went home and put our baby on our insurance plan which reduced the charges by 2/3. 

(5) Discharge was significantly delayed.  An ultrasound and hearing screen was ordered the previous day in the morning. They didn't do the ultrasound and hearing screen until the following day in the afternoon. These are routine tests that are usually done a few hours after they are ordered. Instead of going home that morning, we didn't leave until 4 PM. What contributed to the delay was a Resident failing to leave a prescription that our doctor ordered.",2

Stayed on Floor 7 which had private rooms in Pod D and Pod C.  I noticed that in Pod D the DAY nurses are a little less attentive and slower to respond to the remote control caller button than the night Pod D nurses were.  

Pod C nurses were nicer than Pod D nurses overall, and many of them are friends with each other and attend the same church and even quietly sung some of their church songs together on the night shift, which was very comforting in my opinion.  Pod C nurses were very attentive, quick to respond, were very ""real"" when speaking with me and answering questions, and knew all the ins and outs of getting you the best care from the doctors.  They visited with each other while at the nurses station, that's true, but they rarely got to sit down for more than a few minutes at a time because it was always time for some patient to get some type of attention and it NEVER, EVER ENDS.  

STOP WHAT YOU ARE DOING RIGHT NOW AND REALIZE THAT NO MATTER WHAT TIME OF NIGHT IT IS -- THE NURSES AT BANNER GOOD SAM ARE GETTING OUT OF THEIR CHAIRS CONSTANTLY TO ATTEND TO SOMETHING A PATIENT NEEDS AND MONITORING THEIR CARE FROM THEIR COMPUTER PROGRAMS AND ARE IN CONSTANT TOUCH WITH THE DOCTORS BY PHONE, GIVING THEM UPDATES.  I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY CAN KEEP ALL THE CHANGING DATA IN THEIR HEADS FROM ALL THE CHANGES WITH EACH PATIENT.  It truly is a constant thing around the clock and I know because I was a day sleeper while I was there and I was awake at all hours of the night, getting my ice chps and walking with my walker for exercise and I saw those nurses constantly attending to the patients at 1:00 a.m., 3:00 a.m., 4:00 a.m.  IT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW.

I agree there is a neverending string of visitors wanting blood, taking blood pressure, dispensing your meds, asking you questions, etc. that starts about 3:00 a.m. and goes thru to about 7:00 a.m.  I almost felt I should ""hold a meeting or press conference"" and have them all appear in my room at once and answer their questions and allow them to poke and prod simultaneously and get it over with so I could go back to sleep.

There could be better housekeeping efforts in the private bathrooms by the cleaning staff.

If you find yourself staying at Banner Good Sam for 1 or more nights and are in need of any kind of pain medication (other than the morphine self-pumper - limited of course), then take a tip from me and self-monitor the timing of your doses so that if you are supposed to get your pain pill(s) every four (4) hours, START getting the nurses going on dispensing your meds about 20-40 minutes before that four (4) hours is UP, because it takes them that long to go through all the administrative medical hoops to actually hand you the pills.  If you WAIT until your four (4) hours is UP to ask the nurses for your next round of pain meds, it can take them 20-40 minutes to get it to you by the time they make all the phone calls they need to make, and by then you could be in trouble with PAIN.  I'm surprised that the nurses don't realize this themselves and start getting your next round ready 20-40 minutes BEFORE your four (4) hour interval is up -- but, alas this seems to be up to the patient.  Pod C was better about this than Pod D was BTW.

I only met one Nurse Ratchet, and she was sort of a Semi-Nurse-Ratchet on Pod D -- can't remember her name, but she had that familiar cold stare.

I like the layout of the pods with their circular nurse stations -- they can really keep an eye on the patients that way and they are always at hand, and when you need to do some walking with your walker or IV pole, you can go in circles and still be close to the nurses.  They know which patients haven't done any walking yet, and they congratulate and encourage you when they see you finally up and about!  Also, the ice chip machine is a great find and it dispenses FILTERED water and ice chips -- a Godsend when you are on ice chips and no food for days.  I think the nurses have a running joke about ""Whack-a-Mole"" which describes their constant interruptions during their shift from their patients that surround them in the circular pod.  Being in the center of the pod, the nurses in their nurse station have nowhere to hide from patients!  Those nurses really deserve all our respect and adoration for the CONSTANT care and interruptions they endure with such grace.  

I intend to go back to visit them and thank the ones I remember in person with gifts very soon and I WILL NOT FAIL TO DO THIS AS GOD IS MY WITNESS.  I feel so much better now they may not even recognize me from the pained, dizzy, bloated, hospital-robed, frizzy haired, no-make-up lady they took such good care of for a few days.  I will waltz in there with my hair and makeup done, wearing nice clothes and bearing gifts and hugs very soon!  And no matter what I buy them, they will deserve more to be spent on them!",4
34918,spm7C6S02p-l8FzAW7naEg,CAD0tKIttOTTgT7TMJa-lQ,"I'm basing my review over some instances that I've had to go to their ER.

1. In VERY bad motorcycle accident where I broke my left leg, pelvis and dislocated my toe. Also had very deep road rash.

2. Two instances of painful kidney stones.

For # 1, I was transported via ambulence to the nearest hospital which meant by default, I HAD to go there as the accident happened on I-10 tunnel. I found the staff to be very gruff (in general) and the surgeon was even worse. Do not recall his last name, but his first name was ""Michael"". He basically told me to ""try harder"" when I would try to get up and stand by my bed. I kept telling him I was dizzy and felt like I had to faint. Turns out, I lost a lot of blood during the accident and was needing a transfusion. After I get 2 bags of blood, I'm good to go again! My point being, these asshole doctors really do need to LISTEN to their patients! I also had a horrid night RN come in and was a little rough and bossy to check my vitals during my week stay. How are you gonna feel if someone pokes your damn arm in the middle of deep rest in the night? No ""excuse me"" or anything! I remedied that be asking the Charge Nurse to never send her my way again.I also had my shoes stolen from my room. Not cool.

As for #2, I had to wait a LONG time to even be examined. I was literally in so much pain that I couldn't even sit down. For those of you who don't know how kidney stones feel, just imagine a damned cactus being shoved up your urethra. I'm not kidding. I was there pacing back and forth without any help. After pacing around and begging for something to kill the pain, the RN gave me something and had me pee through what looked like a vegetable strainer. Ughhhh.",1

34922,8HNufoJJI0B8LbqCc917-A,CAD0tKIttOTTgT7TMJa-lQ,"I've been to Banner Good Sam twice.  Once for emergency room visit, once for scheduled surgery and overnight stay.  This is where my doctor wanted to give me my surgery - so I had no choice.

Emergency room was a long wait. In at 8am, didn't leave until 5pm.  Most of the time was waiting around for the 1 doctor that was assigned to the ER that day for my type of ailment.  There were 2 that came in worse than me, so I get it,... but they should have had one more doc on call for times like that.

The surgery staff and overnight ward staff overall are 5-star.  They are attentive, stick to protocol, friendly and professional.  They are the glue of the hospital.

Scheduled surgery went like clock-work. After surgery I was so out of it and quite the jumpy sleeper.. which made most of the nurses laugh with me-- in a good way...

My only ""complaint"" about my stay was that my roommate by the window didn't open the drape and I was in darkness the entire time.  We missed a heck of a monsoon I'm told, but that's not the hospital staff's fault.  We all have to be comfortable so I took one for the team of recoverers.

40685,YSWIswgZ0gR3yyWHmtQCPA,-TIyxSc-lLmJzunje6MD9Q,"Wow!  I just ran across the Phoenix VA Medical Center, sitting right here on Yelp, but no reviews.  What's up with that?¿?

There is so much talk about health care reform right now.  I get my news mainly from KFYI Radio, & as any of you who are listeners know, they spin everything to the political ""right"" on most of the weekday shows.  Since I'm a political moderate, I get highly annoyed with them, about half the time!  One thing I hear a lot is, ""Can you imagine what it would be like if the GOVERNMENT tried to run a health care system?  They tell us we need the H1N1 flu shot, & then they're so inept you can't even get one!""  (Ironically, one of the SPONSORS of this last guy I heard saying EXACTLY THAT was selling H1N1 flu shots & saying they had plenty for everybody!)

Of course President Obama isn't proposing that the Government provide health care directly for anyone new, but here's what it's like when they do:

The VA Health Care System is 100% run by the U.S. Government.  I belong to it, & qualify because I did three tours of combat duty over in Vietnam, back in the days.  I got through it so I could be over here having fun on Yelp now, & making a nuisance of myself!  (Ok, I hope not.)

Over time, I have also belonged to several private health care providers through my employers, but I've been with the VA for most of the time, in various locations around the country.  It has been better for me than ANY OTHER health care provider, except for Kaiser Permanente, which was also very good, & about the same.  (Please, somebody who belongs to Kaiser, give them a review!  They have no Yelp listing at all right now, & they deserve your praise!)

Here's what it's like when the Government runs a healthcare system:

*  When I need an appointment, I call & usually get it within a few days.  Last time, they got me in the SAME DAY!

*  If I need care immediately, I can drop in.  The last time, I waited about 2 hours, since I didn't have an appointment.  (No, I wasn't bleeding or I would have gone right in!)

*  If I'm in Bumf***, Egypt & have an immediate emergency, I can get the paramedics to whisk me to the fastest help available, & the VA will pick up the cost until I can be transferred over to them.

*  Whenever I see my health care provider, I get 5-Star service & am not rushed or anything else negative.

*  In the unlikely event that I don't like my health care provider for any reason (gender, we just don't hit it off, or ?), I can be switched to another one, no problem.

I'm highly satisfied with my care in the VA Health Care System.  (So, why isn't it 5-Stars?)  Ok, sometimes it's hard to find a parking space.  That's the biggest gripe I can come up with.

Yeah for VA Medical Center, Phoenix!  They're good!",4
40686,clHycdA52RoKLJPhFdsCgg,-TIyxSc-lLmJzunje6MD9Q,"Everyone seems to have different views of the VA Medical system but I for one have always received quality care and this VA is no exception.   I like they they are at the tail end of a solar project that is putting panels over every parking spot in the lot, this (I am told) will power the entire VA building and save millions in power bills, plus the added benefit to having covered parking in the middle of July.   Speaking of parking... there isn't enough, so sometimes I have to park north of the VA in the veterans home/ park parking lot, they do have a guy in a golf cart shuttling people, but show up early, I have driven around for 15 minutes waiting for someone to pull out.",4

I just recently came from the Portland VA system, which is IMO is one of the best ran VA systems.  My First visit was to the Phoenix VA Women's Clinic in FEB 2012, after getting home from the Philippine's  I had no mail for my VA visit results so I called to receive them via mail to provide to my unit.  In SEPT I received my Test results I had done in FEB/ the letter was dated JUNE!? 3-4 months to mail a letter? Ok, I have to give this VA System the benefit of the doubt because there's no way this is how this Hospital operates so let's see how my first Doctors visit goes.  After me and my husband waited for 8 Months to get our initial appt. just to assign us a primary care physician. We were asked to show up 30min before my 2:00PM appt. I did! 1:30 show up/ check in was great thanks to Daniel who was very personable/ 2:15 Vitals were taken, 2:30 Back in waiting room/ 3:00 still in waiting room/3:30 I go to front desk to ask what is going on with my 2:00PM Appt. I was here at 1:30PM for? They checked with the DOC (DR. TONG) Diamond Clinic/ She is running behind ""because she likes to spend time with her patients"".  4:15pm! Still in waiting room :/ Apparently she likes to spend time with her patients at the expense of her other patients who have been waiting for nearly 3hrs!! I and my Husband look around to find ourselves to be the only people in the waiting room now and the Hospital quietly closing up.  My frustration starts to boil and tears start to come to my eyes with anger... This is the VA system we are enrolling in??? The Clinic door opens; Dr. Tong addresses us as if we shouldn't be upset at the unreasonable wait... seriously!  I had scheduled a 2:00PM appt specifically to make to the LAB for workups I knew I would be requesting, but because of her inability to perform her tasks with time management in consideration I had to request the test and run the stairs in platforms to get to lab by 4:30, My Superpowers kicked in and I MADE IT 4:25PM! Thank goodness! I dreaded the thought of the drive from Buckeye to this VA again just for Lab workups or to wait in emergency for a blood draw because Dr. Tong was considerate of other patients at my and my husband's expense.  After everything was said and done I had requested for my test results from DR. Tong/ a week later I get a letter saying everything is ""essentially normal"".  Wow! Where are my test results and what does ""essentially"" mean? Come on! Apparently, there's no regard or STANDARD to informing the patient of their test results and no standard for when the patient will be notified of their test results and among other deficiencies in this VA System.  Please somebody take control of this system, all I hear from other service members is ""apparently you haven't been assigned here long."" The Coordinator for Phoenix VA should be ashamed.",1

Also when I tend my friends the things that happen during doctor's visits and the attention I receive from the doctor they are envious. Granted not all the doctor's here are exceptional, some seem to be and act like your a typical HMO doctor who doesn't care about their patient. Dr. Azhar though will actually discuss what she thinks the problem is, and if you offer an opinion on what you might think is causing it that differs from hers she will actually not only listen, but discuss why or why you may not be right and if it might be what you think do follow-up to help determine it. Really?!? how many doctors do that now days??
The catch is appointments may not always start on time, but who cares if that means patients are getting individual attention and get more than 2 minutes of the doctor's attention!",5

Downfalls--the wait list for some types of care (primary care, other than critical, dental care, and one or two others) can stretch out several weeks.  And the parking...

Like the other reviewers here, that's pretty much what brings it down from five stars.  There is a pretty large parking lot but so many people are seen every day that it fills up FAST.  It's worse than Wal-Mart on Black Friday, honestly.

I've been receiving VERY GOOD health care in the VA System for most of the last 40 years.  (I had Kaiser HMO for a while, & it was very much the same.)  Now I can't speak for the guys who were on TV, but here's a typical experience of mine, here at the Phoenix hospital:

I called a little ahead (3 weeks ago?) to schedule a routine Colonoscopy.  Day before yesterday, a friend brought me up for the 8 AM appointment and I was seen immediately.  All of the six or so people involved in my treatment were very friendly, very professional, and I was in and out of there in about an hour and a half.  Treated to general anesthesia, my procedure was nearly painless and everything went PERFECTLY.  

More often than not, this is how it has been for me both here at the Phoenix hospital and at the six other VA hospitals & clinics (Downtown L.A., San Fernando Valley, West L.A., Hesperia, CA, Loma Linda, CA and Richmond, VA) that I have been a patient of over the years.

Last year I lived across the street from the NW Phoenix VA clinic.  I applied for care there, and was told I could not be seen there.  They were not taking new patients, as they had lost the services of several doctors.  I was told I might try the Phoenix VA Hospital.  I did and was given an appt almost 1 year from my call date.  My needs were not for a cold or a cut finger.  It was for Diabetes and I was told they could not see me sooner and that is how it was.  I felt something was strange with the entire experience.  I had to find private care, and even that was difficult in the area.  I could not retire in Arizona and the lack of health care was a big part of the reason, as I was going to need VA health care as I got older. Diabetes was not magically going away, it needed treatment.    They seemed to have no interest in seeing me.  I could not depend on that, so I have had to make other plans in life. I would not be able to retire in Arizona.    I think that is a shame in itself.  I realize everyone has a different experience, but I gave mine and it is a honest review of what happened to me in 2013.

40705,A84inwGuUFRbi4qfNWqG1g,-TIyxSc-lLmJzunje6MD9Q,"I feel compelled to write this after going to the VA Emergency Room and being taken care of literally less than two hours after I went to them with my situation. I went to the ER AFTER going to my assigned Emerald Clinic, and the effiency of the ER really highlighted how poorly the Emerald Clinic handled themselves, once again. This review honestly doesn't include the VA's ER department. I'm not sure if the intense nature of emergency medicine puts all the most skilled doctors, nurses, and staff in that department, whatever it is, they are miles ahead of the Emerald Clinic from when you first see the person at the front desk, to when you leave.

After taking a job offer in another country, I was informed five days before leaving that I need a health examination done. I went into my assigned Emerald Clinic hoping that they could help me out. Now, I knew my situation was far from critical, but I was more than willing to wait as long as it took to get this health examination. I explained my situation to the lady at the front desk, and she told me, ""I'll do what I can."" After about thirty minutes I asked her my status, and she gave me a ""thumbs up"" so I was pleased that I'd be seen. After waiting another hour, I was called in back and told, ""sorry, we aren't going to help you today. You need blood work for a physical, and it's too late to start doing that."" It was approximately 1:30pm. I mentioned the time, and said, ""we literally have hours left in the day, I can go do what you need me to do right now."" She just sort of shrugged at me. I asked if we can skip the bloodwork, and just do a quick check up (I didn't need bloodwork for the job). ""Nahh. We can't do a physical without bloodwork. And nobody else will,"" (lie number 1). Her dismissal attitude, and apathy was shocking to me. What came next though really upset me. Another thing I was told was that, ""your health care provider is pregnant, and not staying til we close, she's leaving early, so even if you get the bloodwork, we still aren't going to help you."" Unprofessional. 

I asked her if she had any suggestions for me. She told me, very confidently, ""oh yeah, go to the hospital on 7th Ave, past Roosevelt, and they do physicals for vets for $20. They'll have you in and out quick too,"" (lie number 2). After wasting my time and gas money driving to the hospital on 7th Ave, they looked at me like I was crazy, and said they do not, nor have they ever, done walk in physicals for only $20. The bottom line is that it was 1:30pm on a Friday when I was in the Emerald Clinic and they didn't want to take a walk-in patient after 12:00pm. So after refusing to help me, I assume the lady I saw lied to me to me to get me out of there quickly.

The person I saw at Patient Advocacy literally shrugged it off and said, ""It's Friday. They want to go home."" Like that is completely acceptable behavoir. Luckily, I got a little empathy at the ER, explained my situation to nurse Sharon (who was awesome), and like I said, I was in and out in less than 2 hours, WITH a health examination. I don't think Emerald Clinic's laziness is fair to the ER, who in my case, blatantly had to pick up the Emerald Clinic's slack. Making me wait almost a hour and half just to tell me they wouldn't help me was another upsetting fact.

A little over a year ago I had to go to the ER and after waiting for over two hours when there was no body in front of me and it was early and not busy I finally got seen by a doctor for like two minutes who was rude and then I never saw him again. 

I had a lady come in and mop my room while the nurse was putting in an IV in my arm!!! Uhhh, hello, do you think could have maybe come back a little later?

I had another nurse who was there to take my blood pressure info just leave the machine on and it beeped for the next 15 mins until finally in all my pain (I later found out I had a kidney stone) I got up and asked someone to turn it off. 

My nurse wouldn't give me any information about what the tests I was getting were for. The room was 71 degrees and I had to ask 3 different people for a warm blanket even AFTER my boyfriend called the nurses station from work to get them to bring me one. 

The place seemed dirty and unsanitary, I mean I guess it was due to all the construction they had to wheel me through but even that was ridiculous. Oh yeah I almost forgot to mention the left over sticky things, the ones that they use to connect your heart to machines, in my gown that I noticed. I was never hooked to a heart machine... That means they were who ever had the gown on before I did. That's gross!.

Then I had to deal with all the payment info and not one person I talked to yet has been helpful. They all seem to be ""busy"" and rude and they act like I'm bugging them for calling the 800 number to get my payments squared away. Ugh! 

Now, I have to deal with the billing folks again. Why, you ask? Oh because they decided not to send me my last bill and even after talking to mulitple people asking them to send me a bill to my new address and them agreeing to. I guess it was just easier to put my bill into collections. Thanks JCL! You guys are swell folks. So today I call in asking to see if we can get this fixed. That I WANT to pay my bill. That I had no intention of not paying it. That there was no reason for it to go into collections. Pat (the lady I spoke to) was no help, so I asked to talk to a supervisor or manager. She put me on hold for about 8 mins and then some how the phone call got disconnected (nice). So I called back, she didn't answer so I left a message. That was at 8am it's now 6pm and no phone call back. Geez that's great customer service.

I came to the E.R. with a serious sinus infection, after my treatment at a local urgent care facility was not working.  I expected to be seen last, because of my lack of medical urgency.  To my surprise, I was seen by the triage nurse in only a few minutes and then admitted within an hour.  The doctors and nurses were extremely nice and answered all of my concerns and questions; I felt like an active party in my care, and it put me at ease.

All of my dishes were coming out seamlessly until I pulled out a crystal platter to add ambiance to the coffee cake. The platter shattered in my hands just as the doorbell rang. I looked at the crystal on the floor and the blood gushing out of my hands, and I went to answer the door. ""I had an accident"" was the first thing out of my mouth. 

After my date cleaned up the blood trail, he took me to the emergency room at John C. Lincoln. Even though it was a Saturday night I got right in to see a doctor.

I received the same answer, just with more attitude.  

I followed up with an additional question about insurance.  After being transfered to admissions or billing (?), someone who should know, asking the question again, a non-answer was for some reason rudely given. ""We bill all insurances"".  OK, thats great, are you an in-network provider for my insurance?  ""I can't answer that question!"" ...CLICK!  She hung up on me!

My opinion is the type of insurance they have, depends on the type of care you get here. People are leaving before being seen because people who came after are being seen before them.

But mostly I was impressed with the nurses and staff, just want to thank them for there help!",5
78839,5kbe812DlNO-2YwR4F4Ytg,Rm8jCL-8fbBAPtPpBJGu7Q,"I was just in the hospital Banner 
Desert Medical Center recently 5-17 thru 5-21 due to an emergency. Getting checked in thru E.R. was fine. then the nightmare was to start.  I am checked out then sent to ultra sound.  Mind you there was one person in the room and by the time about 1 hr later the room was full and not moving, I saw many associates bringing lunch in etc. but when I scheduled business we would make sure things were covered like it never changed. While waiting for a room  my heart was in afib witch that is not why I was there. During my stay all the nurses just didn't seem to care I would call a nurse for assistance they would answer on the intercom, they would be right in and 1 or so hrs. later you might get lucky,  I am on many pain meds for fibromialgia. RA. and many more ailments and when ever they see (any medical center) you are automatic a drug Addict and denied my meds.  I eventually went thru detox which was not good for my heart.  i had celulitus and was in fear in getting mursa or the flesh eating desease which we are still monitoring at home. thank god I am home, You know the food was probably good but when I am sick I just cant see eating spicy foods so I couldn't eat for 4 days.  my Husband would bring me yogart to eat.  the med. asst. was walking around the room and I look down and on his foot he had a huge wad of black hair from a previous patient so what does that tell you. I just about thru up.  This Hospital was so filthy I couldn't believe it, if you touch anything there was either black crap or crunchy stuff on the trays,  I finally asked for some wipes to clean my area up. Due to the neglect of the nurses not answering the page I guess I decided to check out oh ya one of the aids came in the room and found me blue (dead) in bed and they had to revive me. I am only 57 and shouldn't be dieing this young I feel it was neglect. Out of all the shifts I went thru the only efficient nurses were the crisis crew, and a Filipino Gal 17yr veteran there and the nurses aid Deanna they worked on the 4th floor night shift 5-20 Sunday.  very very efficient and they deserve a medal... grant id i am a hard patient to work with at times but not that difficult hospital stunk so bad my sister ordered flowers that smelled good to cover up the smell.  whats  with that I have 5 dogs and my house doesn't even smell like dog and with my disabilities I am not able to keep up as well as i would like. I finally was able to take a shower after asking numerous times and if you want you sheets changed you actually have to ask.  to sum it up you need to watch where your hands touch uggg.  I hate doing this but it needs to be addressed for the board members I don't think they would want to stay in that place. If so i would like to see their homes and how clean they are.  Thank You for letting me have a platform to vent and hopefully fix it. Pam Pierson",1

Banner Desert Medical Center I should add some of the good things that went on too. when I was being checked at the ER, they were very quick in calling us up for evaluation in that time they had found I was in AFIB which can be very dangerous if not treated. and by the time I was finished with insurance documation, etc i believe i was taken right to the back for the DR.. to check me out. so there is a rainbow at the end of the tunnel. Some of the nursing staff and doctors were very efficient too, so they override the bad.  my Pharmacy DR.. and my other DR that came in daily were very patient in explaining things to me .  I think if the rough edges get taken care of maybe this could be an enjoyable place to be despite why we have to go to the hospital.  THE ONLY THING THAT REALLY NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED ASAP IS CLEANING THE ROOMS TOP TO BOTTOM, LIKE THE FOOD TRAYS ALL THE MEDAL ON THE LEGS OF THE IV WHEELIES, ETC. AND UNDER ALL THE BEDS ALL THE METAL AROUND THE FIXTURES, THIS MIGHT TAKE TIME AT FIRST BUT IF DONE RIGHT THE FIRST TIME AND UPKEEP DAILY THAT WOULD DO IT.  NOTHING LIKE THE SMELL OF PINE SOL AND LYSOL WHEN YOU ENTER YOUR STERILE ROOM AND DON'T FORGET  ALL THE REMOTES IT WOULD PROBABLY TAKE 12 MIN. FOR EACH ROOM AND BATHROOM TO DO IF YOU HAVE AN EFFICIENT EMPLOYEE. well i want to thank you for hearing me out and wish you luck in up-keeping the rooms i am sure i will be back.

I've been there three times - each time, the wait was 4 hours +, the admitting nurses were rude, the 'nurse assistants' which you see instead of a real doctor were uninterested in helping, and you only see an actual doctor for less than a minute.  Oh, and they do everything they can to avoid running tests.

I went in for chest pains and it took them 4 hours to give me a breathing treatment, which they did without ever running a single test to see what the problem was.  I went in for a stomach issue and they attempted to give me a medication I'm allergic to - when I said I wouldn't take it, they had a doctor come in to try to talk me into it.  Hello, ALLERGY!

I would like to start this review by stating that I did not, in any way, want to be at this hospital.  My original birth plan was to be a a fancier hospital in North Scottsdale because of their reputation.  I had been to Banner Desert a couple of times to visit friends who had given birth and I was never impressed.

I was admitted to the hospital by a high risk OBGYN due to high blood pressure and possible pre-eclampsia.  I went in with the thought that I would be in for 48 hours of observation and then on my way out to enjoy bed rest in the comfort of my own home.  Well, I ended up staying for 5 weeks.  During this time, I was taken care of in their Antepartum unit.  The nurses and aides were amazing.  They were kind, compassionate and treated me like family rather than just another patient.  They were not only accomodating to me but my husband who stayed the night several times per week.  

After 5 weeks it was time to have my baby delivered.  I couldn't deliver naturally so the doctors took me in for an emergency c-section.  I was so terrified and as the surgery began, I was alone in the operating room with only surgery techs and the anesthesiologist.  I told one of the techs how scared I was and she held my hand while I received my spinal and talked to me the whole time which kept me calmed down.  As terrifying as the experience could have been, everyone in the OR was wonderful.

My baby has been in the NICU for 4 weeks now and has not been all smooth sailing.  My baby got NEC, a very serious intestinal disease, but was caught early and resolved because of fast acting nurses and doctors.  And while I'd much rather have my daughter home with me, I feel very comfortable knowing she is in the wonderful hands of the NICU team.

After this experience, I would never want to be at any other hospital.",5

Mean while he has a seziure, falls out of his wheel chair, and busts his head on the concrete. I'm sick of sitting here in this sess pool of germs. I feel like I've gotten sicker by just being here.

I got a bill from my insurance showing that Banner had been paid, then 2 weeks later I get a letter from collections. I called collection to find out what was going on and apparently the hospital wrote my address down one number off! 2320 instead of 3320. This was for a second bill for the actual physician. Instead of calling me, contacting my insurance, or doing anything proactive, they sent me straight to collections!!! This resulted in me paying over $1000 in order have a hold placed while my insurance sorts it out with Banner so that I don't get a big penalty placed on my credit. 

The hospital side got it right and everything went smoothly, but the physician bill has been a HUGE pain. They obviously have some serious internal communication issues and business policies that are not consumer friendly. I can understand someone typing a number incorrectly, but to not even bother to pick up a phone, contact my insurance, or ask the other half of their billing department for clarification...that is terrible.

When I asked a question as to why the person I brought to the ER was not being seen in OVER THREE HOURS (what kind of emergency help is that?) I was told that his condition is not life threatening and he can wait and the reason that it is taking so long is because of the family members like myself who are distracting them from work. Really? I can't ask questions but I sure should be responsible for the thousands of dollars you're going to bill me later???  I understand that emergency rooms get overcrowded and understaffed but that is no excuse to treat us like cattle.,1
78853,UZNI2CxF6DFveUxP5FniNg,Rm8jCL-8fbBAPtPpBJGu7Q,"I feel like there shouldn't be a whole review page for a hospital. It seems that each person's experience is based on one, maybe two, departments that causes the entire hospital to get a bad review. That said, this review is for the Labor/Delivery and Postpartum wards.

We went in to be induced with our first child at 41.5wks. The initial process of getting signed in and settled into our room was okay. I hate that in order to even be admitted to a hospital these days you have to put in a down-payment. $2K is the baseline for admittance into L&D, which is insane, but it's not necessarily the fault of the hospital (thank you, insurance companies) and is a rant for a different forum.

Once into a room, our first nurse was nice enough, though a bit rough with the Cervadil (I won't go into detail here). We met Dr. Tamanaka, who was the on-call OB from the sister-office of our regular OB, Dr. Linnerson. He was quite nice and explained everything to us clearly and patiently. That was really our only interaction with him since we were admitted in the evening. 

Come morning, we met the next shift of nurses and were blown away with how nice and friendly they were. I think it helps that my husband and I are friendly, reasonable, and generally pleasant folk. We chit-chatted through the morning while waiting for the next phase of the induction process. Our primary nurse ended up having to transfer our care to another, since one of her other patients needed an emergency c-section, and was seriously bummed. Eventually, every nurse on the floor, including the supervisor, came in to see us, claiming that they had to meet the couple that had all the nurses so happy and relaxed. Anyway, the new nurse was equally lovely and I felt like I was surrounded by friends. 

I just realized I'm starting to write a novel, so I'll try to keep the rest of this brief! Our OB, Dr. Linnerson, came to break my water (I think I can leave a more detailed review about him on his office page, Contemporary Care for Women). Bottom line: they didn't jump straight to Pitocin, they gave me time for my labor to progress, and they let me labor how I wanted to. 

Ultimately, when time came to deliver, I was disappointed at how unavailable the on-call OB seemed to be. He eventually showed, but our nurse definitely did most of the work. What I loved about the Dr: he let me ""catch"" my own baby and was super-cool about not announcing gender and leaving that for my husband. Excellent moment for us. 

Fast-foward to the next day when we were transferred upstairs to the postpartum unit. Less-than-impressed, though there wasn't anything wrong with the way they did things. I actually think they were probably just great, but after the amazing experience we had in L&D, it seemed a little lackluster.

Food: great quality, really tasty. The only bummer is the time-frame. Since it takes 45-60 minutes for them to deliver your food to you, you have to anticipate when you'll be hungry and what you'll want to eat. Ordering lunch an hour or so after eating breakfast is weird for me. 

And I think that'll do it. Loved L&D nurses, but Postpartum was meh. So I think 4-stars is fair.",4
78854,x6WhO5Rd-yWTklQtSMGeKg,Rm8jCL-8fbBAPtPpBJGu7Q,"Banner Desert Hospital (formerly known as Desert Samaritan Hospital) was the hospital I was born at many years ago and is also the hospital I had 3 of my sons at. 
Although I have been on just about every floor & unit (either as a patient or a visitor) I dont think its fair to judge or review a hospital as a whole based on the service or experience you had on just 1 area.  All in all the hospital is decent. 

Things I Liked:  the various areas with different themes such as the cow garden, the train garden, the froggy forest, Zen garden, etc.  The patients get to custom order their meals and it's actually very good, as is the made to order cafeteria food. The patient tracking system they have for the people in surgery. 

Things I disliked: There's no smoking allowed anywhere on property and the security is constantly patrolling looking to bust you smoking.  The parking sucks.  All the doors close and lock at 9 and there's only 1 way to enter which is usually on the opposite end of the building then I need to be. Its very easy to get lost and their signs,  inside & out, are confusing. They are slow to discharge.

They found a DVT ( blood clot) that extended from my pelvis to my knee. I also found out I was 2 months pregnant. I was transferred by helicopter to Banner Desert. 
 I was terrified because I had only been in Arizona a short time, I did not know anyone, I did not have insurance yet either. 
 I was seen by Doctor Stephanie Martin, who was AMAZING. She was part of the Phoenix Perinatal Associates ( who i highly recommend). She got me signed up for insurance and got my treatment started. I spent two weeks in the hospital. The nurses and techs were so friendly and caring. I had never seen anything like it before. I could not have been happier with my experience.

The shots didn't work so we were sent to the ER for breathing treatments. We stayed overnight because although they were working at first, she was getting better. I truly appreciate the staff and every doctor we met. They took great care of her and didn't send me home right away, but instead took their time to really monitor her.

Everyone here is so nice and helpful. All of the nurses have been great and they all know tons. 

If your child staying in the hospital, the last thing you think about is if the food is going to be good...until you've been there for a few days and have had to eat it a few times. Here's the deal... The food that they bring you to your room, not great, but hey it's food and you gotta eat. However, if you take the time to go down to the cafeteria and order some food that they will make fresh for you, it's so much better. 

Another one of those things you don't care about until a few days after admission is sleeping arrangements. The bed setup in the rooms is pretty dismal. It's a weird couch thing that turns into a bed but it's so small and me and my wife had to swish onto this thing until we were smart enough to go to the store and get an air mattress. Now my wife sleeps on that and I'm on the weird couch/bed but I have a foam mattress topper and it is much more comfortable. 

I didn't come to the hospital to eat great food and get a good nights sleep. I came to get my son the care that he needs and for that reason, Cardons gets 5 starts. Is give them 6 if I could.

Every single person who took care of him was fantastic to him and everyone in the family. We had relatives flying in and out from states to come visit while in ICU and they let everyone in to see him as long as we wanted, got to help with his care and stay with him. I never was treated bad once by any doctor or nurse and they all had amazing bedside manner, I wish every hospital had employees like them and every patient could experience what he did with the staff. He constantly said throughout his stay that every single one of them were angels. I believe it too. Male or female nurses and CNAs, information staff, cafeteria workers, doctors, everyone was just amazing! Always cheery, loved to have conversations (my grandpa's a real talker and loves telling stories) and they always listened and were happy to chat with him and us. It was like getting to know them personally for as long as he was here at these two hospitals. Five stars for Banner Heart and Banner Baywood!

Also, I had testing done at Banner Heart too, and the staff, they were just as great to me. You can't ask for a better place to go for care of the technology they have to diagnose you and the people to watch over for you. I'm also happy to have Rodrigo Chan as my doctor. He's a great guy, great personality and bedside manner. 

These two hospitals are a great environment for everyone. Cafeteria is unique and has some good food. I would say the only problem is parking. It is crowded for both and most times you're going to have to park in the complex garage.

Without fail, everyone we came in contact with from the moment I was rushed into the ER with a heart attack until I checked out four days later after having two angioplasties and two stents inserted into my aching heat was fabulous.

Thank you all for the terrific care!

My only gripe would be the gowns that showed my ass as I strolled the halls during the recovery, and the kitchens uncanny ability to remove all flavor from the food. How do they manage to make green beans taste like meat that tastes like oatmeal that tastes like cardboard?

Finally, they called a young woman from the lab who found the vein on her first try. Husband was admitted and taken to a room. For two complete days, no one cleaned the room, mopped or cleaned the bathroom. On the 3rd day, I insisted on someone from Housekeeping come in and clean. We had to ask to get his bedding changed on the 3rd day. Trash isn't dumped on a routine basis either. You have to ask them to do it. The cafeteria is only open a limited time each day. The food looks awful, and they have handwritten signs hanging on everything. Really? For a hospital of this size, they should do better. I bought something prepackaged because the food was so unappetizing. Parking is also difficult. This hospital's  only good thing is the service dog, Clancy, who is brought in to cheer patients.

She did about 3 hours of therapy each day (Mon. - Sat.) in Physical Therapy, Occupational Therapy, and Speech Therapy. They seem to have good PT facilities.

The doctors were generally good, but one of the docs she had seemed to just be going through the motions. For minor issues like a potential bladder infection, he would not take any action until she became septic instead of understanding early symptoms and immediately requesting urine tests. Not exactly a model of preventative care. But that was just one of the doctors. 

The setting outside is pretty nice and peaceful, but inside looks a bit too much like a hospital (cold tile floors, and that awkward hospital pink and blue color scheme). Cafeteria is decent, they serve breakfast lunch and dinner for the patients, and visitors can eat there too for only $3 or $4. Nursing Techs help push patients around and help them with their food trays, and they're very friendly when doing so. They even took my tray from the table, and I was just a guest.

You all have a difficult job in caring for those that are dealing with some form of disability. With that, I do have a couple of criticisms which made you okay in my eyes.

1.  My mother suffered not one but two falls while at our facility. This is of concern because even one fall is one too many. I did appreciate the phone call to let us know about it but we didn't know about the second one until my mother told me. She received a heck of a shiner out of it too.

2.  My mother's circulation in her left arm and leg were poor and it took me to mention that concern. That's something that should be checked regularly to ensure she doesn't end up with potential bed sores. She did end up with one on an elbow. Yet again, it's the little things that count.

3.  Why have a person that obviously is suffering from some form of back pain work with patients when it requires lifting. I watched a person come in with very little enthusiasm to help my mother get back to bed and then she almost pulled the catheter out of my mom when she was moving her wheelchair away. It took me yelling at her to get her attention. Once again, little things count.

I will say that Jaynie was very informative and helpful with placing my mother at her next facility. I think she seemed a little bothered by others asking for information on my mother but she called about that and we made those arrangements.

This place is an acute care facility and considered a hospital, so don't expect for someone to stay for a long time. They will receive three hours of therapy each day. It seemed to make some difference, but my mother's stroke was severe so we'll only know through time.",3

(so he tells me; i can't vouch for it since i was out of it).  i wake up to a dr thumping my chest saying 'ok we got her back, there she is'.  DAMN!   turns out they gave me a combination of meds that caused my BP to drop so low that i damn near died.  if my husband hadn't been there i would have died since NO ONE responded to the call button. 
then they decide gee guess we better keep her overnight just in case. meanwhile, my pain is still there. it feels like a steel band is around my chest. the admitting dr is someone else entirely and again i have to give my medical history.  do these people not talk to each other?
so i go from there to the observation unit were the nurses were terrific.  couldn't ask for better care--charity, denise, jan, ect they were all wonderful.   
i had a ct scan, an ultrasound, cardio enyzemes, and no sleep.  i finally get to check out @ 12 on 6/14.  today i get the bill for it.  i was there for about 12 hours, they damn near killed me, i had 1 xray, 1 ct, 1ultrasound, various blood draws, 3 morphine shots and 3 blood draws.  oh and lets not forget the wonderful breakfast.   all this comes to a total of ..........(drum roll please) $16,300.00.    and they have no idea what was causing the chest pain and recommend.............. further testing.
next time maybe i will try john c lincoln.",2

But she also seemed like she still loves what she does a great deal. She put my niece very much at ease during and after the pregnancy. The hospital wasn't a madhouse either which is good. Everyone was very professional yet very flexible at the same time. Everybody who was not in the delivery room had to go into the waiting room. I snuck back in and put my ear to the door so I could hear the delivery and they never said anything. And there was a big sign next to my head that said ""go to the waiting room. no waiting allowed in the halls"" The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have little mitts for the babies hands to prevent her from scratching her eyes which she did a couple times.

Both experiences were top notch but I will focus more on my 2nd experience since it is more fresh in my mind although both experiences were 5-star!

I had a scheduled C-section set up and received excellent pre-operative information from the hospital to prepare for the procedure. The check-in process was very well handled and all of my paperwork was already received, documented, and ready to go prior to our arrival. The surgical staff greeted me warmly and made me feel very at ease with the process. My husband and older son were both allowed to stay with me while we waited for the procedure time and my husband and son were both allowed to stay in the holding area while I had the procedure as well as welcome to join the nurses in the nursery when our baby was born. My husband is squeemish so he wasn't in the room with me during the procedure and never once did anyone make him feel bad about his preference. 

I was allowed to bring my own CD to play music while my baby was being born and one of the nurses took photos immediately after my baby was born. The staff was kind, caring, and very professional the whole way through.

After the procedure and my arrival to my room, I was greeted and cared for by caring, professional aides and nurses the entire 3 days I spent at the hospital. The staff treated me like a friend or even a family member during my stay. I was fortunate enough to have a corner room which was enormous...which is good as we had a lot of visitors. There was no request too big or too small for the staff to handle and even during times when my care was a bit on the gross side, I was always treated professionally and with the utmost kindness. My baby was treated just like he was a member of the nurse's family and the staff never did anything with him without ensuring that I was very aware of exactly what, who, where, when, and how with my baby's care. 

Surprisingly, the FOOD at the hospital was EXCELLENT. I don't know if other hospitals do this, but basically, food service is treated like room service. You call down to the cafeteria, place your order, and within 45 minutes, your food is brought right to your room. The food doesn't taste industrial...it's fresh, hot, and surprisingly good. I was very impressed.

The pediatric ER was FANTASTIC. They made us feel at ease, were prompt with their care of our baby, and provided answers quickly with what our next steps were. 

Ultimately, we had to stay overnight and stayed in the pediatric unit with our baby so here is part 2 of our visit....

The Peds unit is OUTSTANDING. Our nurses, Robyn and Jamie, were kind, understanding, and very professional. We were treated like friends rather than just patients. Our pediatricians during our stay was professional, nurturing, and didn't allow us to beat ourselves up over our baby's issue. But the best part of our visit was our tech, Mary. She treated our baby like he was one of her own kids and she treated us like royalty while we were there.

My family has gone to BTMC over the years as it is centrally located for the NW valley and even parts of the west valley. 

The pediatric ER was fantastic as one mentioned earlier.  

The psychiatric ER is great as well.

My last experience there ( March 2011 ) was pleasant considering I was very intoxicated but not belligerent but I have diabetes so acourse my sugar level was off the hook so I told my wife if I ever get crazy intoxicated ( doesn't happen often ) make sure you take me to the ER.  Nonetheless, they took good care of me.

The most recent experience ( Feb 2012 ) my blood pressure and blood sugar was extremely high and just would not go down ( no I wasn't drinking LOL ) so I called my doctor and he said go to the ER.

The receptionist had an attitude and was really irritating me.  They did an EKG and back to waiting room.  Chest X Ray and back to waiting room.  The ER did not appear to be busy so I was like WTF is taking so long to get a room ?

Finally, after the receptionist frustrated me enough I decided to check myself out because obviously, at least it seemed anyway, my blood pressure and sugar level being extremely high was not much concern I said screw it I will just go home.

Luckily, there were no further consequences from the high blood pressure / sugar.

At 11PM Monday night, I awoke with a stabbing pain in my side and knowing the pain before I knew it was the almighty kidney stone.  I had one about 10 years ago so I knew the pain.

I took a shower hoping to relieve the pain, but this time it was a bit worse.  After getting out of the shower, I got dressed and headed to the ER.  It was about 11:30PM.  I dont know.. but for some reason, im thinking ""Oh it's 11:30PM, there shouldnt be many in the waiting room..."" WRONG.  You would have thought this was Denny's at 3AM.   I counted about 25 in the room.  With half of them being patients.  I checked in and waited.

That's when the pain just started going full force.  There's nothing I could do but grab my stomach and cringe. I was in so much pain, tears were streaming down my face, Im making weird noises I usually dont make and i was just a mess.  I stand up and ask the girl at the desk if there's anyway I can be seen quicker.  A nurse comes out and starts to apologize for the wait and tells me there are others in just as much pain.  I look around and back to her and say ""Are you kidding??  They are just sitting and starring at the wall...Im dying here!""    She apologizes again.

Two hours go by.. I have a CT scan done to confirm a kidney stone..  IM still in pain.  Agonizing pain to be honest.

After going back to sit, I find myself in a spot where Im not in pain. I sit there and think ""Did I pass it??""  I was no longer in pain.. I was no among the people starring at the wall blankly.  

The nurse finally called me in and moved me to a room.  I was checked out and then sent over to another waiting room area.   This is where it gets good.. The nurse staff and doctors were nothing but awesome and kind.  Anything I needed they took care of.  Seeing that I would likely be here all night, they wanted to make my stay a good one.

121896,TPvXksgvx6VVqbLGhtvHeA,aoZELXMGVGrAfUq4fiF-Gg,"I've got a 2 part review here based on birthing my lovely baby in July of 2012-here goes.

Part one:
Hospitals in AZ are very different than NJ hospitals. I am pretty amazed at the lack of security. Back home..you cant cross any point of a hospital without a visitor pass. I've been to 3 hospitals here, and no one needs a pass to get anywhere. I find it weird, but alas..this really is just a quick observation at the ease of getting into hospital rooms in this state.
Anyway..back to my review!
Banner Thunderbird was pretty awesome. I took a tour of the birth facilities during my pregnancy and was at ease immediately. Clean and sparkly, without it feeling like a sterile ugly hospital. The tour clearly explained every aspect from checking in, to where you go at each stage, and included tours of the rooms, OR, etc. 
We were also encouraged to go online and view the classes they offered-I chose a breastfeeding class-which again, was super helpful.

Part two:
In general, I can't say enough about the amazing nursing staff at Banner, all for the exception of one lousy nurse. This is why I can't give it 5 stars. That one terrible nurse, ruined my experience so badly, I wanted to leave, IMMEDIATELY. I'll get to that.
I was induced because I have a lazy baby who was far too comfortable in my womb.
Every single nurse in the labor area was superb. every single step was explained to me in detail..all my needs were cared for..I was made comfortable in every way possible.
The anesthesiologists that cared for me were also superb..explaining everything in detail. 
My husband received a great deal of attention after our delivery with the nursing staff..again, fantastic, fantastic care.
Piper, who was one of my nurses in the maternity area after our munchkin arrived was fantastic..I can't say enough about how much she took care of me.
Great nurse!!
So, on day 4 of my stay (I had a c-section..bah)..anyway..I had a super inconsiderate nurse. WHo scolded me for not nursing enough. Who NEVER recommended I see the lactation specialist, never provided me with the proper care to ensure i was nursing correctly. Other than to yell at me and say ""you are not feeding the baby enough"". I was LIVID I wanted out..immediately.
I think I remember her name, but in my anger, and drug induced foggy brain, I can't say for sure, or else I would have written a letter of complaint.
IN SHORT.
Yes, I loved the hospital..it was a great experience overall, for the exception of one idiotic nurse.
If I had to suggest something for them to fix immediately..offer lactation care to every breast feeding mother. We shouldn't have to ""tell"" you to do that. Your caring for ME..I just sprung a baby from my loins..help a girl out.",4

My estimate was thursday to monday some time. With a husband who works this was frustrating because we have to give a little notice before he comes home.

The grounds and architecture are lovely, and just about all of the staff--from doctors to techs to janitors--are extremely warm and friendly.

I have been to the ER once and was treated with the utmost of concern and kindness. My doctor and nurse were thoroughly invested in helping me. I was actually amazed. As a chronically ill person, I experience a lot of interaction with medical professionals, and it seems that most are jaded against AHCCCS patients, and treat us like second class citizens. This was not the case at Banner Thunderbird.

I am now going through aquatic therapy with the outpatient department, and I have been once again impressed by the kindness and empathy that is extended to me.

In this kind of situation, I would think a nutritionist or dietician would be sent to speak with the patient about what kinds of things would be best for them to eat, especially since poor nutrition choices are a big part of the issue.

I took my bestfriend to the ER and they took an hour to get her in the back while 2 patients sat in the waiting center and 20 nurses sat on their asses chatting about nothing. When we finally got to the back, Dr. Kaufman (btw he won't do anything for you!) questioned her and said he might not be able to find anything. I told him that she had high anxiety along with suicidal thoughts and I didn't want her leaving the hospital without some sort of anxiety medicine. He gave me a HUGE attitude and told me to let him do his job, which he wasn't! I then told him to do his job and stop giving attitude. He'd rather sit here and argue back and forth so I told him that if she leaves here and commits suicide that it's his fault. Funny thing is, he said it wouldn't be his fault and that he could have thrown me out because our conversation was going nowhere. He has no justification in throwing me out for being concerned! I'd be understandable if I shouted foul language his way, but I didn't and he acted like a child by running to get security. I asked the security officer for the doctors fist name and he told me NO or else he'd have to escort me out! Are you kidding me right now!!! Worst doctor ever!!!! Actually Banner is known for useless, lazy, and inconsiderate employees! I've never been to a worse facilitation! They also gave her morphine while she had alcohol in her system!!

121906,1nJPSscHe_ToyRtojJeYuw,aoZELXMGVGrAfUq4fiF-Gg,I will have to admit that when I was scheduled for back surgery and had to go out to Thunderbird Medical I had my concerns. My doctor (Spinal Surgeon) works out of the Phoenix hospital and thunderbird. This hospital was extremely clean and the staff couldn't have been nicer and more professional. I would recommend this hospital over most of the others in the valley. The only downside I would day is the the food could be better but that kind of goes with most hospitals.,5

The hospital is well set up with a logical set up clearly used by other hospitals, but with a ""cleaner"" look.

Doesn't smell like a hospital. :-)  And I was fasting at the time, so my sense of smell was impeccable.

Lobby is nice looking... the only thing is the elevators.  You get in them and you feel like they are going to fall apart.  They creak and groan and shriek... ick.  Nobody likes a freaky elevator.  And I used a number of them in that building.

In the surgical services waiting room, they have these nice flat panel tv's to watch the news on... so much better than other waiting rooms where there is nothing.  And there was PLENTY of room so you didn't have to cram right next to someone who needs their space, or even if you need your space.

I know in Banner Thunderbird, I lost my cell phone signal, but not in this one... it was excellent in there. :) Hope that doesn't come across as shallow... but when you have a loved one in there for a sudden appendectomy like the poor lady that was next to my loved one, you need that cell phone reception.

The RN assigned to my family member was great.  He worked with us quite a bit... his name is Rick, so if you ever get him, he's great. :)  A few of the CNA's were great too... Charlie (who was funny as HELL), Jaime... and there was another who worked nights whom I don't remember her name. They were good.  A couple were weird... some CNA's don't know their boundaries (playfully attempting to touch the bandage where you have been stapled that same day is not a fun game) and others just don't know how to stick a fricken needle in my partner's arm less than 5 times.

Other than that... they were great.  It was clean and well maintained, everything worked.

I know they used to get a bad rep a few years ago, but that seems to have changed as we were not affected by anything negative.

The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because nothing about it made me say ""wow"" either.",4

The so called P.A. that was taking care of her seemed like she did NOT care or want to take the time out to figured out what was really going on with her. I would have rather had a vet take care of my daughter then this so called P.A. who spent a total of 10 mins with her. All she did was order a number of labs to be done then after they were done she  came in said everything came back okay and said ""Some people just pass out for no real reason its nothing to worry about just go home a rest."" This was the first time she even saw her. She just did not want to take the time out to figure out what could be going on. Trust me I would not take a frog there for a Band-Aid.

The nurses and staff were very friendly so it wasn't a big deal. After that I got a cat scan done, waited another hour did the doctor to tell me I have an abnormally large cyst on my ovary. The doctor, DR. KANG, told me this and ordered an ultrasound. After a couple more hours of waiting in a lot if pain he came back, repeated I have a cyst and sent me home to ""go to a gyno"". Then he walked out. After HOURS he didn't even tell me how big the cyst was and gave no further information besides to take 600 mg ibeprofen. When I explained that I had already been taking 800 ibeprofen for days and that's why I came to hospital, and if prescription ibeprofen worked I wouldn't have needed to come. I was on morphine while in the ER and was still in a huge amount of pain. I explained this practically in tears and he literally repeated his sentences and refused other treatment. I started bawling from pain and frustration and he responded with ""I'm not prescribing you opiates"". I was COMPLETELY and utterly offended. I work 70 hour weeks and I consider myself to be responsible woman, and I can't work those hours in this kind of pain. I felt as if I was being made out as a person with a drug issue because I'm younger (24) and ibeprofen doesn't work on me. I explained how I felt and told him how I felt that he was treating me unfairly and unprofessionally. Especially by not even taking more than 30 seconds to explain what was wrong with me. He didn't even let me finish my sentence before He immediately got defensive, raised his voice, saying he told me it was a cyst and if I wanted to know the size then he would just show me the paperwork and then snapped that he would write me a different prescription and walked out. I immediately burst in to tears again. I felt as if they were just trying to get me out of the hospital without a care to my health. All he thought I cared about was getting a prescription when I was more concerned about the cyst GROWING INSIDE ME. The other staff was nice but he was very insensitive and rude the minute I stood up and told him how I felt. He treated me as an unruly 20 year old instead of a young woman in excruciating pain.

A few minutes later a nurse comes in telling me to sign a form so I can be transfered to the ER at UMC, WTF? So I asked if that was really neccessary and she said yes so off I went. Got to the ER at about 8:30 pm and didn't leave until 3:40 am! The waiting room wasn't even that full but I was out there for 2 hours before they called me back and then was sent back out again, this happened a few times. I was finally called back and taken for my ultrasound around 12:15 but I didn't even realize that was where I was going till they parked me in the hall outside the ultrasound room, then I had to wait because no one had the paperwork for me. When the ultrasound was done they came and wheeled me to a room and then just left me with no explanation about what was coming next, oh and the guy pushing me said he would go get my husband but he never did, I had to get up and ask a nurse if he could come back since he didn't know what was goin on with me at that point. So got to the room and waited and waited and finally after about an hour a doctor comes in (doesn't tell me his name or anything) and starts asking me what is wrong, hello isn't that on my chart at this point, but ok I go through the story again and he says that it probably isn't a blood clot but he will have to look at the ultrasound and then *poof* he is gone and never to be seen again. After another 1.5 hours I'm really tired and getting really pissed off so I look for a nurse to ask what is going on and when I find one she asks me if the doctor is discharging me!?! How the hell would I know, so I tell her I haven't seen the doctor for 1.5 hours and last I heard he was supposed to be reviewing my ultrasound. She says she will go check with him, yeah you do that, so I go and sit and wait and then another nurse comes in and tells me to sign the discharge paperwork. Ummm so what the hell is going on with my foot, ""Oh there's no blood clot but you knew that"", so I ask how the hell am I supposed to know that if no one tells me. So fine what is wrong with my foot and what do I do to get it small enough to fit into a shoe again? She literally shoves a prescription for 800mg ibuprofean in my face and says take that and keep it elevated. At this point I am either going to start crying or hitting people so I just take the paper work and leave since it is now 20 to 4am and I have to be at work by 9.

The experience was the most horrifying of our lives and I would not recommend this hospital to anyone. My child was admitted for 12 days. We were never even offered a blanket or a cup of coffee by anyone. My child was taken for wrong tests, given lab draws that were meant for other patients, NEVER had her pain controlled. We overheard the staff in the ER talking about other patients. They were especially unkind about the patients with mental illness or alcoholism. They talked about every woman who came in with abdominal pain stating in various ways that she must have a sexually transmitted disease. The nurses and doctors were rude and demeaning to the patients and treated most with varying levels of disrespect.  I understand that the facility is a county hospital but there is no excuse for treating any human being regardless of the problem without dignity. I have been to a county hospital in Southern California before (at Arrowhead Regional Medical Center) when one of my children had a skiing accident. Despite the county designation we were treated with respect, compassion and dignity.",1

But, they have the rudest, nastiest ER nurses and doctors that I have seen anywhere. I work in the medical field and have an excellent understanding of how a hospital should run. This hospital stays open because it is a trauma center and is in high demand with all of the traffic accidents on the highway between California and Las Vegas. The staff at this hospital treat you like you are a non-paying county patient. I am totally shocked that my first review of this hospital was not accepted. Every word I wrote was the truth and actually I had much worse to say but kept somethings to myself. I would like to know how people can get an accurate view of an establishment when reviews are not posted because they were to harsh?",1

What I do appreciate with this hospital as a student: I'm exposed to chaos, grumpy nurses (not all) and real patients = real world experience!  Units/rooms are hard to find.  

If you expect to be pampered and treated like a baby, this is not the hospital for you.  Patience tends to run low here (from patients, visitors and employees).",3

If I was a producer, I would do a reality show just on the waiting lobby alone. Cuz if you sit there long enough, you will witness a crap load of drama unfolding with every minute. No need for a script or auditions for actors, it doesn't get any realer than this! 

Took my wife here for a severe headache. Did the registration paperwork, etc. Then we sit and wait. This is where the magic begins. 

Right off the bat the people we sat next to were tryin to sell us tamales. At the moment I wasn't hungry but remember this incident. 

The lady to our left was in some kind of pain cuz she was hunched over and moaning. If you just walked in and was blind, you would think she was having some great sex cuz the whole time she was moanin, ""Ohhhhhhh........Gooooooddddd! Oooohhhhhh Jesus!"" This went on for about 2 hours before they finally admitted her. Wish I can post video with this review so you guys can get the full effect. 

After about 4 hours we are admitted. Now mind you, their ER bays are very small and you are only separated by the sliding curtains. I didn't know there was an old guy next to us until he woke up screaming, ""IT HURTS! IT HURTS!"" The reason why he woke up was because his pain meds wore off so they gave him more morphine is what I heard the nurse say. What's  funny is once they give it to him, he was already asking when the next dosage was. If you ask me I think he was a morphine addict.

A couple of times I had to go back to the lobby because of a couple tests they had to do on my wife. Mind you I havnt eaten since lunchtime so I was starting to feel like Joe Pesci and the vending machine didnt have any Snickers of course. This is where the tamale dudes come in. Why they were still there I dont know. I didnt see any of them with a hospital band. Anyways, I got 2 beef tamales for 3 bucks. I was expecting the worse but it was actually good. Dont know if I was really hungry or these were the best tamales I ever had.

These are events that I wanted to convey that I thought seemed surreal because the whole time I was wondering when Ashton Kutcher was gonna jump out cuz I swear I was being punk'd. If I actually told you guys every single funny detail, then this would not be a review anymore. Could be construed as a biography.

Refer to my pic of the guy that has long gray hair. I swear he was a young clean shaven man when we first got there. The 4 hours we were in the waiting lobby you couldn't help but observe everything. I noticed everybody was on their phone and people actually brought their chargers knowing they were gonna be there a while. There were only 2 power outlets available so if you were one of the 4 lucky ones, time goes by faster for you. Of course, you cant go a couple hours without having to go to the bathroom. There are two unisex ones. Both stink, have no paper towels, and I dont think it matters if you use the sanitary cover sheets. 

So my wife finally gets the medical attention she needs. Long story short, we showed up at 5 pm, got admitted at 9, went home at 4 am. I gotta say the service we received was extraordinary. The events leading up to it were what is quite memorable and im not so sure that is in a good way. So everything equals to just ok. When you first get there it all seems hopeless and forlorn. But the great medical service made up for it. Still wouldn't be one of my first choices though.",3

The facilities were clean, although the patients (myself included) were obviously not.

I had huge problems with their staff - the lady at the front desk who checks patients in took my contact and insurance info down, and I double checked that it was correct. Somehow this info gets translated incorrectly to the billing department. Never received a bill and find out about the debt from checking my credit history. Yes, my fault for not checking in with them after not receiving any bills for 6 months (life lesson learned) but really they lost my insurance info, sent mail to the wrong apartment number and never tried to call me?

As I sat in the waiting room, vomiting and crying out in pain, they took me into the dingy, dirty emergency room and say me in the hall way in a wheel chair (I was in extreme pain and vomiting my guts out. They just left me there. It just so happened that a doctor (Dr. Young) was walking by to see another patient when he spotted me. He immediately told them to take me to cat scan, may be it was the vomiting, my crying out and the pale white color I had turned that he became concerned with. Well, the cat scan showed that my appendix had burst, they ran with me to the operating room, atlas I was saved. My problem was with the hospital room they had me in (437-A) It was  filthy, I was hospitalized for a total of 5 days and not once did anyone from the housekeeping staff come in and sweep, or mop or even empty the trash. The bathroom, each time I used it I had to bring a wash cloth with me to clean off the seat (the crackhead in the next bed looked and talked shady and I wasn't taking any chances) the floor next to the floor boards in the bathroom had about an inch of black crusted dirt.....I am not kidding. When it was time for my discharge they asked me if I wanted to shower, I politely declined and told them I would shower at home (I had given myself sponge baths). My concern is, isn't infection rampant in hospitals? I can certainly see why! I hope I never have to return there for my own health. The experience was eye-opening, the crackhead next to me said that she would take my medicine if I didn't want it (she had heard me tell the nurse when I didn't want it) telling me just act like I took it, I was mortified. She ate my food if I was sleeping and constantly had her crackhead friends there, the nurse told me that she was in and out of the hospital on a weekly basis looking for pain medication.

Scripts aren't filled and forgotten about. Scripts that do get filled are returned to the shelf if you don't pick up within their arbitrary time frame which they claim is a week but in reality was less.

148423,AXx8C6pVGj56PDJq8Q-iqQ,xKUlhZEaPzYMjWy5BLq7IQ,"I am going to try and be as objective as possible here. I went in with severe abdominal and back pain. I waited for about 30 minutes, which wasn't bad at all. It is important to mention I have no insurance and have my Medicaid application in process, but I do qualify. I let the intake nurse know this when I arrived. When I went back to triage, the nurse came in with a snarky attitude which I didn't mind too much with me being in pain. I didn't care. She drew three vials of blood and NEVER took them back for testing. The doctor reminded her to give me pain meds 3 times and she finally did with a nasty attitude. 

I went back for x-rays and an ultrasound. That all went fine. The workers were great and very attentive but by the time all of the testing was done, my doctor was off and I had a new one. The new doctor came in and told me what the ultrasound showed. He was nice. I asked him about my x rays and the blood tests. He said he didn't know anything about that and that I would be discharged. He said the nurse would be in to do paper work. I am still under the influence of pain meds and couldn't quite verbalize how shocked I was by the lack of information and attempt to look into it. I look to the left and on the tray I see MY vials of blood STILL sitting there. Are you kidding me? 

So, I start getting dressed and a NEW nurse comes in.. She tells me to get dressed so she can assess me. She has no idea what's going on. I tell her I'm being discharged and she asks if I'm confused! I repeat myself and tell her I'm not confused, but I may sound a bit loopy from the medication. She leaves and talks to my first nurse and confirms I'm being discharged. 

She walks me to the checkout desk where a very pretty woman tells me I owe $200.00. I tell her I have no money right now and I mentioned this on intake. Her reply, ""We don't talk about money up front, but you should have common sense to know that you need to pay when you see a doctor. You shouldn't have come here if  you couldn't pay."" I guess medical emergency means nothing to her and I wonder if she talks to the homeless people that come in this way.I let her know that I have Medicaid in place and they will back pay for up to a month before the paperwork is finalized. She states, ""That doesn't matter, you owe money right now."" I am crying at this point, somewhat unable to verbalize what I need to as I'm still foggy in the head. I just repeat I have no money and I don't know what to do from this point. She says, ""What did you think they brought you to this desk for? To PAY. THAT'S WHAT!"" She then rolls her eyes and states, ""I'll just bill you but you need to pay this! It's in your best interest to pay!"" I say okay and limp out of the ER to my friend confused about the entire ordeal. 

This place has some good workers mixed in with a lot of bad ones. I would NOT go here if you can avoid it. I have heard horror stories about ""The Best Hospital in Las Vegas"" but now I have my own. Go anywhere but here. I spent 7 hours in a place receiving little to know information about my condition and being scolded for no apparent reason. I miss Illinois. They had community care. If you could not pay, they would assign you a social worker to set you up with information about your options.",1

My 67 year old sister had a bad hip injury that was poo-pooed by too many, but when brought to UMC, they took her in right away and cared for her nonstop until released to a physical rehab center. Every doctor and potential doctor, plus every nurse, all support staff, and every member of the cleaning crew were sociable, professional, upbeat without being sappy.

My experience at UMC has been excellent (not ""as good as it gets as in Perfecto""...but exceptional nonetheless). one morning at 3:30am I needed to be driven to the ER here...and the RN's and the MD's were true servant leaders who all deserve a medal with appreciation and respect.",5

This one was good, but we did run into a few problems along the way, so I just gotta take off a star if I'm going to be objective at all.

The good: they saved my mom.  She had a stroke and within 5 minutes of bringing her into the ER, she was diagnosed and started treatment.  Some of the staff was very nice (as if they were treating their own mother), understanding (they let one of us stay the night even though the rules say visiting hours are only between 11am and 8pm plus they let us all visit at the same time even though the rules say only 2 at a time), and knowledgeable (when the initial doctor recommended some very aggressive treatment, one of the other staff schooled us on its actual usefulness and potential and very dangerous side effects).

The bad: some of the staff was not very nice and downright rude.  My mom needed her sleep, and one of the nurses would come in almost every hour to do something, like give her some meds, take her blood pressure, or take her blood.  Why couldn't they schedule that all to happen at the same time so my mom could sleep all through the night?  Not only did this nurse come in all the time, but the way she woke up my mom was by turning on the big bright lights over the bed and practically yelling her name.  And the first kid that came to take her blood almost burst a vessel because my mom has bruises up and down her poor little arm.  Not cool, man.  Not cool at all.  That kid was so scared by all the blood, she ran out crying to find another nurse to take the blood for her.  Jebus.

The ugly: they could have put my mom in a coma.  I get it, they have a very small window of time to apply certain medication or treatment or whatever, but these doctors have to understand that this isn't a TV show and you can't just throw that kind of pressure on family members who have no idea the damage that something like that could do.  Give us ALL the side effects and potential outcomes.  Another minor point: sometimes the alarms go off and no one comes to check on them.  I'm guessing it's because a lot of them are just little alarms, but they should just get rid of those if they are.  People are trying to sleep and I get that the staff is busy running around and then they don't have a chance to turn them off, but these alarms are going off for several minutes at a time.

Given all of that, they still saved my mom and for the most part, treated her (and us) like family, so I still gotta give them a good review.  It ain't perfect and like I said above, all hospitals should have perfect 5 star reviews, but hey, i guess they still did their job.",4
157062,w0DhlkrEcNIsW9ZEXVyShg,LwUxmAZ_l3yvRPnrQi6n3w,"I've been here twice. I came here to visit one of my friends when she gave birth. The maternity ward is pretty nice, from what I remember. It's definitely a step up from UMC.

I was a patient here once. It was after 3 am, I was at The Cave, a gay bar back then, with my then-boyfriend. Enter a drunk patron who had been escorted out of the club who then hurled a small boulder at one of the security guards. Only it ricocheted off the guard and into my forehead! Gaping bleeding wounds. I needed stitches. I was in a room at the hospital for about 3-4 hours before I got medical treatment. A male nurse took one look, and muttered something, which I thought was really unprofessional. And why was I waiting for so long if it looked that bad? There were only a few other patients there besides myself. So, that's why I've only been a patient once.",2
157063,W-Aqv8ngdeh2StPONesAGw,LwUxmAZ_l3yvRPnrQi6n3w,"I guess it's not pleasant when it comes to review hospitals, probably due to the fact it relates to bad stuff that happened to a person for them to require hospitalization.

Anyway, a family member had a medical emergency and had to go the hospital. As you might have heard, medical care in Las Vegas is not really top notch (especially with rating of D-). Anyway, it scared the crap out of me thinking if my relative will get better or worse in one of this hospitals.

The first experience was inside the ER. That night ER room was full and there was no available bed when we got there (by paramedic), so we had to wait on the gurney for about 45 minutes before being admitted. 

While my relative was in O.R., I waited in the surgery waiting room. The room was clean, well lighted, and has a nice flat screen TV with many cable channels you can choose from. It was a nice distraction while waiting for news of your love one. There were restrooms nearby and they were very clean also. 

After surgery, my relative got put in a private recovery room, which has its own bathroom. I was really surprised how clean and pleasant the room was. I have been to other hospitals before and most of them have that sick odor in the room that just make you sicker. Not this one. The room was so clean and the air was pleasant that help you and your family member feel at easy and comfortable.

Except one unfriendly nurse (i don't think she likes her job), all other nurses and doctors I met were very friendly and helpful. 

I would give them 5 stars if we didn't have to wait so long in the ER room. Other than that, thank you Valley Hospital for doing a good job.",4

Why would a person work in the health care field if they didn't want to help people?  I was told this is a training hospital.  We met a few nurses who were very nice and helpful, but they were few and far between.  One nurse was bragging how happy he was to be leaving in a week.  Once admitted we never even saw a doctor and had to sign an APA form before they would let us leave.  We were so happy to just get out of there.  When we received the bills a week later they were so expensive we thought maybe we had stayed at Johns Hopkins Hospital!  In my opinion, if you have a choice go somewhere else.",2

There were no doctors on the floor to check up on her and the nurses kept telling us the doctor will be in at a certain time and when it came that certain time they told us he'll be in later... and then later turned into ""I dont know when the doctor is coming in"". This place is very unprofessional.",1
157066,6oinemeYQgTfFveojUUxxQ,LwUxmAZ_l3yvRPnrQi6n3w,"My 1st personal experience (emergency room) here was not good. See original review. My 2nd personal experience was way better (surgery). Is it because they were totally different circumstances? Could be. 

I had two choices of hospitals, this one and Spring Valley (which is nowhere near my house) where my doctor would do the surgery. I opted for this one, reluctantly. I scheduled the surgery but tried to get an earlier appointment, which I later did (monday versus wednesday- thanks to Nilda at the Womens Cancer Center). I was able to get pre-op done (pre-check-in) on the preceding saturday as a walk-in (but the lab forgot to take a pregnancy test when they drew my blood).  I tried making an appointment on friday (for pre-op) but I left a message with that department and never did get a call back. The lady that assisted us was very nice (there were teen vounteers wearing blue shirts and khaki pants, but since they were new, did not really know anything) and she told us that our payment portion, after insurance, would be a percentage (she printed out a sheet for us). She told us that when we come back to go directly to counter number six (?) for the express check-in. 

Since we parked in the same parking lot for the emergency entrance (for pre-op), we knew where to go, on monday morning. Sunday was prep day (I won't go into detail, but all I could eat was clear broths, liquids, and jello for the entire day). Monday morning (I'm talking like 5:30 am) was a Operation Central; I swear there were about 15 of us scheduled for surgery! The initial waiting room was filled with people. After express check-in, and a short wait, we were all relocated to the Surgery waiting room. More waiting. My name was finally called. I sprang up, eager to get the whole thing over and done with (wasn't quite sure what would be done, per the doctor's findings at the time of). 

One nurse prepped me (took my weight, gave me the robe and sheet, etc.) and tried taking a sample for my pregnancy test (that test was forgotten at pre-op; and I was bruised from pre-op). After I was in my bed, another nurse then took over from there. Like I said, there was a bunch of us having surgery, so she was busy (but she was attentive nonetheless). I also then took the blood test (pregnancy), this time on the other arm. (The girl next to me, was having the same operation as me.) The nurse made sure that I was warm enough, with additional blankets. My husband was allowed back to see me, right before surgery. I got the IV here. I met my doctor (who told us that she does two of these surgeries a week, assuring), the anesthesiologist (only male in the bunch), and more nurses in the operating room (smiling faces). I remembered having the bright light in my face for a few seconds (didn't even count and I was out). And when I woke up (the operation was pretty quick), after the doctor said, ""Ok, we're all done.""  

After the last nurse, I remember seeing my husband in the recovery room. I could barely open my eyes (very heavy since I was heavily medicated). My husband said that I was okay- they took one tube, one ovary, and the cyst ( we feared that I would need a complete hysterectomy and go into early menopause, which would require taking hormones along with other issues). The nurse was so helpful with me, as I could barely move without any assistance. My FIL, his wife, my sister, and my mom were able to see me (separately). An elderly volunteer wheeled me out so I could get into the car. A couple weeks later, Maureen called me to see how I was doing- it was nice to get a follow-up call. 

So, as you can see, I had a totally different experience this time. I am now confident with going to this hospital again, if I ever need surgery again. With the exception of the two snaffus mentioned, the care here was excellent- every person was nice (wish I remembered all the nurses' names) and instrumental in my experience.",5
157067,otOTdu_YicuNA6Hwt32KRQ,LwUxmAZ_l3yvRPnrQi6n3w,"This would be the last hospital i would ever want to be at. The nurses/doctors were really uncaring non-helpful and wouldn't even talk the time to take a culture to see if i had strep. I had a very bad fever, vomiting for the last 6 hours, and apparently i was not allowed to know my own temperature here. The nurses barely spoke to me and acted like they were bored and wanted to go home rather then sit there with their patient and caringly ask what's wrong. this happened all after coughing up blood in a walgreens bathroom waiting to fill my prescription from another hospital that was just as horrible.. Nevada health care is the worst health care in this country i would have to say. Just horrible! For being someone going into the nursing field i am absolutely appalled.",1
157068,zw5OFBQg7BaUBGI-0he6rw,LwUxmAZ_l3yvRPnrQi6n3w,"This at first glance looked like a mid to low income type hospital and I know the reviews for these types of places are written by people on the worst day of there lives but as you read my review understand I was there only to visit a friend of a friend and I was having a great day to this point. 

I was at one lower class facility and it was a state run Veterans Hospital that was built in the 60s. After finding the elevator we rode up with a scary looking guy and a weird looking gurney. My GF whispered I think someone just died and we must not be in the right elevator.

They guy said no this a public elevator what floor are you going to? He got out on our floor and that freaked out the GF who started worrying about her friend. (Who was ok and recovering nicely) after visiting for 20 mins we went out to the elevator and there was the guy with a FULL BODY BAG! He smiled and said, ""going down?""

The cycle of life doesnt bother me. But the lack of respect for the deceased does greatly. They should have closed the doors on the floor and taken the body out to a back/service elevator. If they dont have one available the body could have been moved after visiting hours. But I can imagine that would have cut into their profit margin.

If you can go anywhere else I highly recommend trying them first.",1
157069,TeIg5ztUkuGi3IoQ0qpS7w,LwUxmAZ_l3yvRPnrQi6n3w,"Until I visited Valley, I was actually in a nursing program at NSC.  My experience here singlehandedly changed all that and made me realize I didn't want to be a nurse.  

In the ICU, the nurses are overworked, stressed, and hostile.  During a brief volunteer stint, I witnessed firsthand multiple mix-ups with records, nurses being given WAAAAY more patients than is safe to handle at one time, and nasty attitudes in regard to patient requests.  I don't want to go into too much detail, but suffice it to say that what I saw upset me enough that I immediately switched career paths entirely.  The nurses were MISERABLE.  As a former teacher who was pretty miserable myself in that profession, I couldn't IMAGINE going into a field where I would be equally miserable.  That's the impression this place gave - that it's an awful place to work or be laid up.  It was so bad, in fact, that I contacted hospital administration about some of the awful things I witnessed.  I don't know if it ever came to anything, but I sure hope it did for the sake of the patients.

During training to work or volunteer in the Valley Healthcare System, they constantly refer to patients as ""consumers"" - oh yes, we need to make the ""CONSUMERS"" happy.  This dehumanizing attitude prevailed throughout my experiences in this hospital.  Patients weren't treated as valuable human beings.  Instead, they were treated like these sick, annoying cash cows for the hospital.  How awful.

If you have a choice (and I know sometimes you don't), I'd advise you to choose a different hospital for yourself or your loved ones.  If you're going to be viewed as a consumer - if that's REALLY all you are - then you might as well be an educated one.",1

My visit started with admitting, where they misplaced my paperwork and I had to call my doctor to tell them the problem, who in turn, got the supervisor in admitting to all of a sudden locate the orders that had been faxed to them twice.  Really??  Upon arrival for the surgery, my admission was slowed down by lack of information because for some reason, two days later, my per-op information was not completely entered into the system. Entering the prep room, the nurse inserting the IV poked and missed so many times my vein collapsed and my hand swelled up like a football and they had to move to the other hand, all the while, all she could talk about was the tatto on my wrist, which is a memorial to my son who had recently passed. This, of course, upsetting, depressing, and irritating me right before surgery. Again, really??  Upon waking in recovery, I had major spinal surgery. My entire lower lumbars were fused with an unbelievable amount of hardware. My surgeon, who is not a resident doctor there, was wonderful. Sorry to say, this hospital was too far under his league of expertise. I woke from surgery to an 10 inch incision in my abdominal area and an 8 inch incision in my back, 42 staples, and an indescribable level of pain. I was given no pain control whatsoever. I laid in recovery like this for 9 hours before I was given a room. In the meantime, my husband and other son were waiting in the waiting room for 15 hours at this point, not being told anything about my condition, and when asked, they were told I just went home by a nurse who was impatient and uncaring and didn't bother to check for them. They had to ask another nurse, who finally found out that I finally got into a room, and was told a room number and I was there. They got to the room to find I was not only not there, but it wasn't even my room. When they finally got the right room, they sat and waited there because I wasn't even out of recovery yet. Incompetent.  Once in my room, the nurses were huffy, uncaring, impatient and rude. I was left with no pain control for 24 hours before my surgeons assistant came and took care of it herself. Every time I needed assistance, I had to call for a nurse repeatedly, only to get results when I became loud out of pain and frustration. Every person there during my visit was incompetent, rude, obviously hated their jobs, uncaring, in compassionate, and god forbid if it was time for a shift change. Never, in my life, will I ever, ever, EVER recommend this cold, heartless, thoughtless, rude, uncaring, in compassionate so called hospital/staff.  They should all be put in front of the board and the building should be shut down. I will refuse to even die there. I'd chose the gutter first, the rats would be of more assistance and compassion than Valley Hospital in Las Vegas.",1
157072,QWFkOSBKajdoO-sFNL9RBw,LwUxmAZ_l3yvRPnrQi6n3w,"I don't know about the bad rap, and I'm glad I didn't look at hospital ratings on deciding where my  grandma in law is going because I would have been worried for nothing. My MIL had a good experience here before so she had Grans sent to this ER. 

The people were nice in the ER and sincere, but it was terribly slow. It seemed like there was a lot of beds and they did run some tests on grandma that a neurologist had to see to figure out what happened, so I wasn't expecting it to be speedy....BUT...... sitting on a stiff chair for 12 hours to a inconclusive answer is kinda a long wear on us. They told us they were transferring her up to a bed in the hospital since she was stable, but needed more test in the morning and observation. It took 2 hours from the time we were told until she got moved up. 

Once there on the 3rd floor wing though, the stay was fairly pleasant. The nurses were definitely very good. Our main nurse Sua was kind, observant and quick to act on things, but the other ladies on the wing were also helpful should we need anything. Grandma and my MIL really liked the Neurologist, Dr Zift too. A little bit of kindness and consideration goes a very long way in keeping everyone calm and patient while they helped reach a diagnosis. 

Also I appreciated while there is a 2 person limit usually, no one was kicking me out of the  for being the extra and being just her grandsons girlfriend. They understood with the circumstance of really not knowing what the hell is going on at first and grandma not fully cognitive that it was important to us to be there. In case you know, it was life ending stuff. And really what does one extra person standing in the corner gonna hurt? It encouraged grandma to see all of us, when she could make sense. 

Based on the diagnosis and the needed recovery, they got us a case worker that transferred her to a rehabilitation center so she only stayed 2 days in the hospital room. Maybe this isn't the best hospital around, but certainly not the worst. I think if I was sick I would probably go to here than it's neighbor, UMC based on the caring aspect of the staff. Neither are speedy, but that seems par for the course with most hospitals.",4
157073,vBndXPiCQmN0_o_rUTHglg,LwUxmAZ_l3yvRPnrQi6n3w,"I would start by giving the nurses here 5 stars. I had two out patient surgeries and both times I had fantastic nursing care. 
Now the bad- 
Pre Op- I was given a packet and told to go from department to department getting my pre op stuff done. I went to cardiology for an EKG and sat for two hours. They have one machine for the hospital, so the tech and machine were being taken to the ER constantly while I sat and waited. They said I could come back the day of my surgery and hope it gets done (uh no!) or wait. I waited, then they called a woman who came in 30 minutes after me. I asked the lady at the desk to please take me first and she shrugged. I was so furious that I loudly announced to the tech that I was next and she ignored me!! When it was my turn I confronted the tech about the rude treatment and she pretended to not hear me!! 
Check in day- I get my paper work from the check in desk and read it over while walking to outpatient surgery. They had me scheduled for the wrong surgery!! The doctors orders were all right in my chart,but whatever the paperwork at the desk  was, was wrong- very scary to think!!
Post Surgery- The person wheeling me to the car was rude. I just had back surgery and was doped up and extremely nauseous. He was chatty and I politely told him that I did not want to chat because I was not feeling well. He pushed me so fast down the hall that I had to ask him to slow down, which he did not!! 

My second surgery was sudden and I had one days notice to get it scheduled. I was told to show up at the hospital at 5am the following day. I called them and asked if I needed to redo my preop work since I had just had surgery there a few weeks before.  The woman on the phone said no, I would be ok. I show up at  5am and sat in admitting,waiting for them to open the desk. I observed security and a janitor talking about drugs that they saw in the corner of the waiting area. They looked, agreed it was drugs, and kept walking. I finally check in and they tell me to go get preop blood work done. It's now 5:30,surgery is at 7. I was told to be in the surgery area by 6:30. I go to the lab down the hall and a girl tells me they are closed for lunch and I would have to wait until the tech comes back. I sat until 6:45,when the desk clerk came in, furious at the blood techs for not taking me. All of a sudden someone was available. I rush over to the surgery area and I am greeted by nurses yelling at me for being late!! I tried to explain and no one really cared, they were all mad! After that point all of my care was great and the nurses were as friendly as always. I understand how a late patient can throw off the day, but there needs to be better communication between departments. I was already stressed and scared about my surgery. I did not need the pressure of running around last minute and then being yelled at.

I had my surgery a few months ago.  It was a horrible experience for me and because of their mistakes, I had to not only take more time to heal, I lost my job.  The guy who was to help me out of bed and get me to walk pulled my gown so hard and tight that he pulled my drainage tube 95% out the day aftery surgery...he was non apologetic, he just didn't care..and the nurse that came after our walk was in shock as to what he had done. She ran to get the head nurse because I bled all over my bed...the fear was that there may be an infection because of what he had done.  It caused me to ruin my furniture when I got home because I wouldnt stop bleeding/draining. My bed and coutch were ruined. While I was at the hospital, When I needed a nurse I would push the button...but rarely did they come when I called, I learned that if I crawled out of bed to the bathroom, there was an emergency button there that I could push and they would come running..   The nurses are overworked and hostile..the environment is non caring...I was treated as if I was an inconvenience. I was not treated as a person who just had MAJOR surgery, I was treated as if I was a 3 day stay at a cheap hotel.  The cleaning staff went through my things when they thought I was asleep, they even sat and watched TV.  The nurse who took me off my drip, forgot to put me in manually for my pain medicine every few hours, by that afternoon I was in sooooo much pain.  The head nurse and the AM nurse argued in my room over this.  My surgery was lumbar fusion, so I was cut on the front and back sides of me...it was painful to say the least.  I got my morning pain medicine at 8am, and got my next dose manually that evening.  it was horrible. Lets talk about food.  When laying in a bed, if there is a tray put on the rolling tray holder you cannot see it.  Some Blonde with a major attitude the 1st morning after my surgery walked into my room and and quipped ""Oh, not hungry or are we just on a fat loss regime today?""  I was not at all happy with her comments, 1st of all, I didn't even know food was up there, no one told me food had arrived...because of my oxygen tube I couldn't smell. She had no right to make a rude comment which made me feel Fatter than I already am... later that afternoon more food came, she just dropped it on the rolling tray holder, then pushed it away against the wall while she straightened up...then left!  I pushed the nurses button for over an hour, finally when they arrived the nurse brought over the tray.  COLD mush is NOT an option...COLD coffee..no offer to get fresh food...I ended up not eaying till 2 days after my surgery...The STAFF does NOT care!  I wrote a detailed letter to the CEO, Head Nurse and the hospital administrator after I got home.  The CEO responded back to me a few weeks later apologizing and saying he will make sure there is more training for the nurses and staff. That's it??  Never offering to replace my furniture, or asking me what the hospital could do to make things better for me.  
Now a few months later, I am healing, but I have no job to look forward to returning to because my FMLA ended too soon for me.  I spent over 2000.00 for new furniture. Both of these things would not have been an issue had the staff been attentive and not reckless.  I have heard from many people that they also had bad experiences at Valley Hospital.  I wish I would have known this beforehand.  I would have chosen another hospital to care for me.  After all....it's about a healthy life.
ps...there was an intern there who was very sweet, and even ran to the cafeteria to get me a cold diet coke...she mentioned that she may quit soon because she didn't want to become a hostile nurse like the ones who had been caring for me.  She was very afraid, and I wish her the best in her decision.",1

There are few and far between nurses and admin that make up for this crappy experience.  But the far more prevalent culture of employees who think they know you better than you and are snobby little bitches are in your face 24 hours a day!  I had to contact the hospital administrator just to get these placating women to do very simplistic things!  They DO NOT listen to you, they deliver things 4 hours or more late (if they ""remember"" at all), they actually begrudge you if you stay more than 24 hours and they WILL go behind your back and do what you specifically asked them not to with YOUR child!  They will also not suggest things they COULD and SHOULD do for you because of the ""extra"" work.  What ""extra"" work?  YOUR A NURSE!!!  I found these things out when the good ones came in and said things like ""where is your ""such-n-such"" haven't they given you one yet?"" and they would run to get whatever it was....but this was after the shift change where before you had been complaining of pains or concerns for hours and no one did anything about it!  Then they will sneer at you to your face if you ask them direct and simple questions like ""How is my baby doing?""  These people need some serious training or firing!  Only a select few Makayla (lactation specialist), Mary (Nurse), and middle eastern nurse (sorry I forgot your name) and a VERY few others gave me reason not to fail this hospital entirely.  

Here is a concrete example of why I hate lazy or stubborn or vindictive ""professionals.""  I was not producing enough colostrum (pre-milk), so the pediatrician on-call suggested I supplement.  I expressed that it was my wish that my child be breast-fed only, but she never mentioned that I COULD use the hospital pump.  Later on (after missing two feeding times another nurse asked if I'd like to and I said I would.  A friend of the family who has been a long time maternity nurse told me over the phone that they should have brought me a pump right away and that if I went too many feedings without breast milk that my child would maybe not take to the breast at all, that my milk could dry out and not to listen to these nurses who were trying to shove supplement down my throat as well as my baby's.  Sure enough my nursery nurse was CONVINCED that supplement would ""cure"" my infants slight Jaundice.  So she (against my very clear request fed my baby by the bottle BEFORE bringing her to me to try and breast feed first!  I had to beg for bottles to express milk into, then I had to get out of bed hours after delivery and walk down to the nursery (where I wasn't getting a very welcoming vibe) and basically watch to make sure they were feeding it to her!  A nightmare!  They could have ruined my chances of breastfeeding my own child and deigned her all the wonderful bonding and benefits that breastfeeding offers.  All because they didn't like me staying as long as my daughter or getting into what they obviously considered to be ""their"" business.  I'm sorry.  You have MY daughter in your nursery.  YOU WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE!    And you had better answer me when I ask you what is going on with her!  

In short, unless you yourself are already well educated in hospital terminology and have been through what you are being admitted for more than once before, I strongly recommend going somewhere else, because these people will not aide you in getting the most out of your hospital stay and by doing so could adversely affect your health.  There are simply not enough of them that listen to the patient.",2

The Word? Uncaring help

The Place? Valley Hospital 

Wouldn't want to be caught near death there. Ever! Had a very unsatisfactory 'stay' there 2 years ago when I had surgery for a Stent implant. Placed in regular ICU instead of Surgical ICU, with a constantly beeping machine in my room; got no sleep at all, had 3 really rude nurses, with one placing a used urinal on my food tray and leaving it there next to food. 

Extremely UNHELPFUL ICU supervisor as well. And, very unfriendly, much like a non-caring ROBOT. 

Worst hospital in America. 

The word? Dreadful
The Place? Valley Hospital and Medical Center",1
157083,2BKJuuYPzUo3VuGn4ebn_g,LwUxmAZ_l3yvRPnrQi6n3w,"Well, after reading some of the reviews dating back a couple of years, it seems like not much has changed at this hospital, Valley.  I had the misfortune of being taken here by ambulance/LV Fire and Rescue 3 days ago.  I was having all the symptoms of an impending seizure (dots and auras) so rather than risk having the seizure at home, we called 911 and got the great paramedics from LV Fire and Rescue (they get 5 stars and then some)  
Once we got to Valley, I was wheeled into the ER and sort of just left right in the doorway while they waited to get me checked in...so while I was laying there I had the opportunity to just kick back and watch the goings on.....My first impression---I told my husband verbatim....I don't like this place, I want to go home now.  I have NEVER seen anything like it.....the guy next to me was I swear drinking some sort of alcoholic beverage from his fast food beverage cup, I could smell it......a patient getting drunk in the ER....Really??????
There is absolutely NO privacy for the patients....side curtains only....no front drawn curtains......beds are lined up EVERY WHERE....Mine was directly across from where the docs were doing their dictation on patients and I swear I have never heard doctors badmouth so many patients in my life.......Seriously.....The nurses (and I use that term  loosely, were all just standing around badmouthing everyone they had come in contact with.....I never really saw any of them working....my doc said that since I hadnt gone into a full fledged seizure, it was not an emergency and I could go home....I asked for something for a massive headache that I got, he forgot to order anything.....so my husband finally had to go ask him..,mind you I was only about 6 feet away from him the entire time....he asked a nurse to get me a pill,, which was the only time I saw her....she brought the pill and the discharge papers at the same time....and I was released....this was such a wasted trip....no labs drawn, no exam of the head, no ct, no nothing.....just it's not an emergency, here's a pill, now get the hell out.....I would rather die than come back here....and I never will come back....oh and I almost forgot, had to go to the restroom before I left....OMG...it was FILTHY.....dried urine on the floor and on the toilet seat, NO DOOR LOCK ON THE DOOR (really).....nothing like a disgusting restroom in a place that supposed to be clean like no other.....Wow.......Ok, so I gave it one star but truthfully IF I could, it would get Minus 5......Beware...Find another  place to go....Sunrise, Desert Springs, Any of the St. Rose hospitals are EXCELLENT....Think twice before coming here, unless you want docs who badmouth patients, nurses who give you a dirty look when you ask a question, dirty rooms, and no privacy at all.....You want all that, then this is the place for you.....For me? Never again....EVER....",1

I even asked some Qs about after my dad was discharged and they told me not to worry bout it, um seriously? That response alone makes me worry. One nurse kept talking to my dad during her shift after it took her about 45 minutes to bring a pain pill for a headache the night before major surgery, he even told her repeatedly that he was trying to sleep, eventually he got rude about it, but come on, if some one in pain the night before surgery doesn't want to small talk with you can't you just respect that, she kept saying he needed rest we",3

I was registered right after I arrived.  I didn't even been to take a seat and be called but rather sat down right at the registration desk right after arriving.

Registration was quick, and I sat for about 10 minutes before an employee came to give me a few more papers to initial and sign and then I was taken inside.  My phone and insurance cards and license were secured for me.

My surgeon had arrived early and he came to see me as they were hooking up the IV and getting ready to take me to the surgical suite.  After the vitals were done, I went to the surgical suite and before long, I was in dreamland.  I woke up in recovery.

Everyone from the Center with whom I was in contact were polite, personable, and professional.  Friends drove me to the Center and brought me home and I was out of my house all of about 3 hours.  Not bad.

Even though I was the last patient if the day, she didn't try to ""push"" me out of recovery. I would highly recommend this facility.",5
163724,ztCiGh5-XJ09u_RfqmLK3w,YWIDquDD5n7L7VWD6D4mig,"Finally a hospital in Las Vegas that my relatives love.  I'm not saying that everyone will find this the best hospital in the area, but for us, it was.

1. Medical Care was excellent.  We knew everything that was going on.  The doctors for the most part were prompt in meeting with the family on every procedure being done, and discussed every medication being given.

2. Overnight care - the nurses, respiratory therapists, and doctors were never far away.  Unlike the other hospitals like Summerlin (boo! piss-poor! Kiss my Aspen!)  and Centennial Hills (a.k.a. Centennial Hell), , there was no lack of staff resulting in our family member being ignored for hours at a time except by all of the machines being monitored.  Mountain View, though, was really respectful of patients and their families. 

3. Paperwork, check-in, and check out was prompt and fair in price. They had all the documents in order when we checked out, and even days later were there to answer questions and make adjustments.

But it's really the special features of this hospital that make it special.  
First, a family member can stay with the patients overnight except in the intensive care unit where they have a waiting room.  But while we would take shifts watching our relatives, the nurses would do their job professionally and cheerfully, The Filipina nurses were the best, and the main reason I am giving this place a 5 star rating.  

One other cool thing is their awesome cafeteria.  I usually dread hospital food and their public eating place.  But there stuff was fine, some things (like their coffee, entrees, and pastries) were cheap, like less than a dollar for French roast coffee, and about a dollar for a good muffin.  I full egg, hash browns, and bacon breakfast will run around $3.

It's awful having to go into a hospital, but what a relief it is to know there are a place where you can get healed.  Oh, and in a poll of hospitals, average emergency wait times is less than 10 minutes here and about 40 minutes in all other hospitals.",5

Nurses in emergency room horrible- too busy to help you with anything, rolled eyes at you if you so much as asked for water. They were in the nurses station having a snack party but couldn't help sick people.  Completely understaffed. Wait time to see a doctor was 17 hours. I have great insurance too. If you don't have insurance they sit you out in the hall and transport you to UMC. I cannot even begin to describe the disgust I felt after the treatment I received by the nurses in this dump.

I actually had to rip out my own IVs and cardiac monitors when it was time to leave. If they told you something would take 5 minutes it would take hours.",1

It was a good thing it wasn't too serious of an injury and we were pleased with the level of service here.  Since she didn't have a prior condition of low blood sugar, it took a little while for the doctor to figure out what happened.

In the meantime, the nurses took care of her and kept her in good spirits. Despite the high cost of the treatment, Mom was happy that she was taken to this hospital and recommends it to others.

I got to the hospital at 4pm, Thursday. There was protein in my urine and elevated blood pressure; so by 6pm I was being induced. I had a C-section at 8am Friday morning.  It was my first baby and I really cannot believe how little pain there was.

He was having extreme pain in his mouth.
I know you might be thinking why didn't I just take him to a Dentist but it was almost midnight and there was not one open we could find under his insurance.
I will say the wait time was unlike I have ever experienced. He only had to wait 15 minutes.
When he was called to be seen they only saw him for about 5 minutes. They checked his blood pressure and gave him a prescription for a antibiotic. 
As it was time to check out the very very very rude person at the desk said he needed to pay $100 for the visit. We had no issue with that then after she took mt card and swiped it said ""it will be $1,200 for anybody who walks into the front door"". 
We were shocked at the way she spoke to us and never once smiled.
We asked why so much when they did nothing but check his blood pressure and give him prescription. She just said that was the way it was and that would be final.
We felt like were int eh principles office or something!
He ended up needing 6 teeth cut out which a Oral Surgeon in Summerlin did and did an excellent job (no relation to mountain view).

We got a bill a month later for way more then the ridiculous $1,200 the rude person at the desk mentioned and when he called for a detailed bill they actually laughed.

If you text the number 23000 - you can get wait times for the local hospitals.. so that's what we did and Mountain View had a wait time of 15 minutes.  It was a Saturday, so we had to make it snappy -- :P  

Getting checked in was a breeze, didn't take long at all.  It wasn't jam packed like i expected it to be on Saturday evening which is awesome.  There were multiple people checking patients in so we weren't waiting very long.   There's a type of [VIP] line--- that isn't the exact term for the line--- but it's pretty much a speedier line that Jose was able to get into.  Not sure why-------- probably cause he was cute or something.  No, JK-  I really don't remember.   Anyway-- we were in and out in 1.5 hours which is pretty fast.  I've been in the emergency for this man and have waited a total of 4-5 hours for 2 sprained ankles.   

Everyone was polite-  no one was rude at all.  

There is a big waiting room in the ER check in area.  needs some big time upgrading.  It could be scary. ... really scary.  The walls seem yellow, the one toy in the room has  a scary drawing on it.  The chairs are  really old looking.   it's time for some upgrades.  

On the other hand, you walk out of that area where you check in and wait... and there's ANOTHER waiting area.  Much nicer.  The cafeteria also in this area, as well as the gift shop.  Access to the rest of the hospital is an elevator away.

163734,KcYKs40AATYrh9nITcb3tQ,YWIDquDD5n7L7VWD6D4mig,"Here was my experience:

I had seen this hospital several times in passing, as I live nearby. After being sick for 11 days, and with fever and the inability to breath, I decided it was time for the ER. I drove myself and my roommate, who was also ill, to the hospital. As we were on the freeway near the hospital we saw a billboard that said FAST ER waiting time 19 mins. We thought ""Awesome"" and figured we would be seen quickly. Needless to say, that billboard was GROSSLY inaccurate. We checked in at approx 1:30pm and was not called to triage until about 2:40pm. Out entire ER experience lasted about 6 hours and I did have a 1 hour breathing treatment.

While waiting in the ER I had the most heartbreaking and disturbing experience. A little old lady, 96 to be exact, was asked to go into the public women's restroom alone to pee in a cup. I followed the lady in, after I was given some meds myself for fever. God only knows how she filled her cup, but she was crying, trying to get up from the toilet and pull up her pants. I offered her my help right away. I had her hold onto my shoulders and hoisted her up, pulled up her depends and pants, put the lid on her urine, put it in the bag and literally put my hands under her arms and carried her out to her wheelchair where her son was waiting. I cannot believe the hospital staff asked her to go in there alone. Afterwards when I brought it to the attention of the nurses they apologized to ME and told me I shouldn't have helped her because I was already sick and could've hurt myself. They should've been apologizing to her and not made her gone alone! I was furious and disgusted how things were being handled this day.

I understand that hospitals get busy. I also understand that this was a new area, that they were under staffed and having technical issues with the computer system. I also understand there is absolutely NO excuse that makes this situation okay.

The only reason I gave a 2 star rating is because my Doctor, Dr. Chan, was amazing, otherwise I would have given the -5 if possible.",2

My mom was discharged from intermediate care at another hospital and just needed to get her strength back. She could go to any rehab facility, but she decided to come here based on her good experience the first time she fractured her back.  She had to be medicated for severe pain and they gave it to her fairly on cue at the right time. The staff was just too kind, not only giving her the medical care and attention she needed. Some of the staff even came in just to give her a hug. The physical therapists and occupational therapists generally were very encouraging as she did her strengthening exercises and life skills. The CNA's were awesome helping her get in and out of bed, and go to the bathroom no matter what time of day or night. I realize then I do not have the personality to be a healtcare worker, and learned to respect the entire staff. The doctor came in at least daily to check up on her and speak to the nurses about each patient's care. Every shift change, the outgoing and incoming staff would exchange notes and discuss updates. So why not 5 stars?

There was one physical therapist that was too aggressive with my mom and caused her so much pain, she was actually set back a few days in her recovery. As a result, the staff kindly made sure my mom would only work with the staff she was comfortable with.  On a less important note, the food was decent but boring as the menu rarely changes. And, it takes forever to place your food order because they really customize it for the patients. When it gets to the patient, it's usually not warm anymore.  Problem is, the food travels 100 yards from main building to this one, 

One thing cool about this hospital is that they have a recliner bed.  So. one guest can stay with the patient, keeping them company and helping with minor things like answering the cell phone. I stayed with her for 5 days (going to her house to shower and get new clothes daily).  I witnessed first hand how professional the staff was day and night.   On the day my mom left, she was happy to be leaving, but sad she won't see those friendly faces again anytime soon.",4

On January 8th my dad walked into the ER with my mom where my mom told them my dad was having a stroke.

My dad then aspirated on January 21st where my called and pushed the nurse's button. It took two hours for Respiratory to get to my dad TWO hours when it should have been less than 5 minutes. After this event my dad's lungs filled up with Fluid which ultimately caused him to lose his life on February 5th, 2013. It was hard enough to see my dad die in front of my eyes but my mom and I also had to endure the cruelty of the doctors and nurses in this hospital. There were a few nurses that took really good care of my dad but the majority of them were cruel and had no feelings. I reported nurse after nurse for their treatment not only to my dad but to others that had no one in their rooms. I would report nurses when I overheard them making fun and laughing at other patients.  Doctors so cruel where the only way they would help was once my tears started and I would beg. My mom and I took turns in my dad's room for 1 month day and night. My mom was so weak and dehydrated from not taking care of herself that she almost ended up in the hospital but would rather have died in the parking lot then be admitted to Mountain View. I could go on for hours on the daily cruelty we endured this past month. I'm writing this review for two reasons. 1st reason if you want to live or have your love one live don't take them to Mountain View. 2nd reason if you have had or are going through a similar experience please contact me.

Mountain View isn't too bad. There are many hospitals in Vegas and I have been a patient at five of them. I have to say that Mountain View was not a bad experience for me. 

My first experience at Mountain View was when I had my first baby. I had a regular delivery and I was in labor for 14 hours. The labor and delivery nurses were great. They were very patient with me and I felt very comfortable the whole time. After my delivery, I was moved to the postpartum side and the nurses there were just as nice and helpful. I has no issues during my stay here. I was also able to have my own private room during my stay which was great, as it allowed me to get some sleep and it was great for that family privacy and bonding time with our new baby. They brought in a roll away bed for my husband so he could stay the night with me. The nurses also showed us where we could help ourselves to sandwiches, sodas, juices, fruit and pudding cups, which came in handy during the middle of the night. 

My second experience at Mountain View was for a full spinal fusion, where they went through my stomach and placed a metal cage on my spine. Then they rolled me over and and screwed it into place through my back. I was in surgery for six hours. I woke up in intensive care and spent a week in the hospital with 40 staples up my stomach and 40 staples up my spine. To top things off I was also in a back brace. During my week stay at Mountain View, the nurses were really patient with me and they helped me with everything. Again, I was able to have my own private room, which was great because I was there for a week and I was pretty messed up, so by the time I was able to start getting out of bed it was nice to have my own bathroom and space to move around. The worst part about my stay was the physical therapy lady that kept coming in my room to make me start moving again. I would just pretend I was asleep, but she would always just come back........Boooooo! 

As for the dreaded hospital food........ Mountain View isn't bad at all, as long as you are not on a restricted diet. You have a menu and you can order whatever you want off the menu. They cook what you want to order! I stuck to the things that I knew were hard to mess up, like chicken strips and french fries, and they were always pretty yummy. I would even order Pepsi, not bad for a hospital! The trick is to order early, because if not you will have to wait a while, because they do make food to order. 
It is way better than the food at other hospitals in the area because it's not the food that they bring in on the tray and you lift off the lid and surprise....... you have no idea what the mystery meat is!",4

I usually go to St. Rose but it has really went downhill. My best friend suggested this place so I gave it a shot and I'm so glad I did! They have a kiosk that you check in with. It's super fast and easy to do. The staff was really nice, accommodating and even joked around with me :) I was there for only 1.5 hrs! That included my cat scan and discharge. Luckily it was just a concussion. God forbid if I ever have to go again, I'm definitely coming here and will recommend it to others. I know others have mentioned that it looked dirty but I didn't think so and compared to other hospitals in Vegas. Besides I'm not there for a stay, I just want to get in and out.",5

When checking me in they did everything but call me a liar. They treated me like a junky trying to get some painkillers. They shrugged off my discharge papers from Urgent Care. I sat in the waiting room for a total of 4 hours. I got an external and intra-vaginal ultrasound, just to hear the CT Scan guy talking to another ultrasound guy about how I wasn't actually in pain at all. They insisted on giving me a CT Scan, telling me radiation wasn't involved. Liar. I refused. 

After another 1 1/2 hours of sitting in the waiting room, they finally bring me down what felt like every hallway in the entire hospital; which, by the way are all in midi-construction AND lined with patients laying in beds moaning and groaning - with handwritten signs above their head stating which 'room' they are in. 

The lady at the desk, turns out to be a nurse - she tells me to put on a hospital robe because I'm having a pelvic exam. an hour later when a male nurse comes in, he looks at me like I'm crazy because I'm half-naked. He hooks me up to a blood pressure machine and heart rate monitor and shuts the lights off on his way out because he says ""You'll be here a while""...it's already been 6 hours.

2) Before we ever saw any type of healthcare professional, we got to see a person from billing! I mean, you come in for what is clearly an EMERGENCY, but don't worry, this hospital knows what the real emergency is, making sure they get paid before they do absolutely anything. 

3) The doctors here are psychics! After you see the all important billing people, the psychic doctors might spend about 5 minutes not listening to you. (My boyfriend came in with an infection in one eye, exactly like the one I'd had a week before, only his was much worse and causing severe pain, we'd already been to our primary doc, but when the pain started came here) Even though we kept telling the doctor that this infection had been persisting despite antibiotics for 5 days, and only gotten worse, the doctor insisted it was allergies before even looking! Truly, a unique allergy is one that only happens in one eye after exposure to viral pinkeye! He doesn't have allergies, or any other allergic symptoms, but anything could happen in this magical place, science be damned! 

4) After our psychic consultation, we were told ""we'd just have to wait it out"" until we could see an eye doctor on Monday, despite the pain! Since, yanno, it's not really a doctor's job to relieve it or anything! It seemed our psychic-- err-- doctor, didnt know much about eyes at all. Best of all! We got Lortabs! They aren't very effective for eye pain! But they will help somewhat for the next six hours.... until they wear off, I for one, can't wait!

I just wish to thank Mountain View hospital for what I'm sure will be an amazing Sunday sitting around with my boyfriend while he writhes in pain! You guys really are the absolute best in medicine! Remind me to drive right past this place if I'm ever dying!",1
163743,qSLYv2UDQFlafqxrU3oNPA,YWIDquDD5n7L7VWD6D4mig,"I wish I could compliment this hospital. I had my own horrible experience and was not happy when I found out my mom was here. My mom was in the E.R. and treated by Trevelyn on 8/4/2013 around 4am. My mom was very dissatisfied, because no information about her condition was communicated. Things just got worse when she was admitted around 3pm. The entire staff lacked any urgency and real competency. They could not answer simple questions or respond quickly. Her doctor was Dr. Achin, her demeanor is very unprofessional and derogatory. After seeing my mom had Pancreatitis she put her on a unrestricted diet. You can die from Pancreatits and are supposed to fast. Dr. Achin became very defensive when I tried to ask any questions about why my mom was put on an unrestricted diet and admitted she did not know what was really going on inside my mom. But she knew she had early Pancreatitis. She said a G. I. specialist would come and look at my mom and another test MRCP would be performed. We waited all night and no test. I left my information with the nurse and was never called with any updates. I got a call from my dad that my mom went in for the MRCP about 10am. No updates from the nurse! When I arrived at about 12pm. My mom had just gotten done taking the MRCP. I asked to speak to the charge nurse who was Myra and Patient Advocacy. Mrya did not show any concern or care for my mom's treatment. She could not tell me anything. (When the G.I. specialist would come today or not, why I wasn't called by their staff when my mom went in for the test, why we weren't told the MRI machines close at 5pm in admittance and we waited all night for my mom to have the test done). She did call Dr. Achin who could not be reached. Another patron arrived looking for someone to visit and Myra read allowed all the patient names of those on the 3rd floor wing that she had. Is this even legal???
 Dr. Achin arrived about 3:00pm on the 3rd floor and could be heard yelling into the phone for the G.I. doctor to come. Although it was unprofessional to yell loud enough so patients inside their room could here it was probably the only thing she did do with any urgency.  When she came in to see my mom she had no answers as to what was wrong. She said she had no diagnosis and no plan. I was taking notes as she was going over my mom's vitals and I asked her if she could slow down. Myra was also present. I asked Dr. Achin politely if she could slow down and clarify. Her English is a little hard to understand due to her accent. At this point she started waving papers and said I will give this to you!!! I calmly asked her why she was getting an attitude. She yelled and said she wasn't. I looked over at Myra who rolled her eyes but remained silent. My mom asked Dr. Achin when she thought she could be released. Dr. Achin said if you feel better now. At this point I firmly spoke up and said how can you let her leave without reviewing her test results from this morning and without seeing the G.I. specialist?? Dr. Achin got even more defensive. My mom who has high anxiety at this point said she just wanted to leave because the situation was too stressful. I told her she could not leave until she saw the specialists and insisted she stay. Dr. Achin just left the room. I got my mom to calm down and agree to stay. 

Outside the room I spoke to Myra and expressed this quality of care was unacceptable. She said, ""You are making your mom upset"" in front of 2 other nurses and another doctor. I said, ""Excuse me you are blaming me?"" I said I wanted to speak to risk management and patient advocacy. She called patient advocacy and got voicemail. She said I could leave and they would call me. I said I would not leave until I spoke to someone. She yelled maybe we need to call security and walked out into another part of the hospital. 

At this point I went downstairs to the main desk and asked to speak to Patient Advocacy. Pat, a women volunteer called and got voicemail. I told her I would wait. About 15 minutes later Barbara Streyle came over. She was very professional and listened to what happened. She immediately knew who Dr. Achin was and described her beside manner as abrupt. At the time I felt she took my concerns about my mom's Pancreatits seriously and genuinely cared. She went up to check on my mom and also to get my cell phone charger. Ms. Streyle said she would get my mom a nicotine patch which my mom never received. 

Later my dad went to see my mom and said the G.I specialist disagreed with Dr. Achin and wanted to run more tests. After running another test they still could not find anything other than Pancreatits. The G.I doctor told my mom not to drink for 6 weeks and to come back and get another scan then. She was then discharged. Great job Mountain View! Great job!",1
163744,n_CjAMvxhGrF_OekUX4HWg,YWIDquDD5n7L7VWD6D4mig,"5 stars for the nurses at Mountain View Hospital (especially in ICU)
5 stars for the respiratory therapists 
4.5 stars for layout, decor, amenities etc.
4 stars for overall experience including initial experience upon arrival to emergency
3.99 stars for hospital food 
Hospital food is not the best, but it's really not that bad. During the week there is a chef who prepares the meals, many items from scratch, including soups of the day. (however on Sat/Sun they are not from scratch)
For visitors, there is a cafeteria with a small but good enough salad bar.
Also, specials each day for very reasonable costs.
Nutritional information is displayed for most items.
If you want to find something wrong with the food, you probably will, but for spouses, family and close friends who spend each minute of each day that they can at the hospital with their loved one, this is a nice option to have. It's certainly better and healthier than fast food.

Today is our day 16 at this hospital
On a Sunday morning at about 6am while staying at the La Quinta next door to this hospital, my husband woke me and said he could barely breathe.
This is the first time he ever had such a symptom. Age: late 50's
He was able to walk at that point, and our room was on the first floor very close to the exit to our parked car.
We walked to the car, I helped him in, and we drove 2 minutes to the circle in front of Mountain View Hospital emergency room. This is our first personal experience with a hospital emergency room so we really don't know ""the process"" and just assumed that once you get to an emergency room there will be medical professionals there to help immediately.

I ran inside, and the only person I saw was the security guard sitting at the desk. 
And a few patients sitting in the spacious waiting area.
I told the security guard that my husband is in the car, and he can barely breathe.
He quickly went through a closed door, and came right back to tell me 'she'll be with you as soon as she's done with this patient"". 
i reminded him that my husband could barely breathe and that we probably needed to hurry. 
A few minutes later 'she"" walked out with a wheelchair and I quickly walked with her to the car where my husband waited. As I explained to her what happened, she snapped at me ""why didn't you call 911""? And I replied, because we were staying at the hotel right next door and since he was able to walk, we thought it would be faster for me to drive him here...""
Immediately they took him in and other than that seemingly snide remark, the rest of our experience has been good to great.

Diagnosis was congestive heart failure with pneumonia among a few other complications.

11 days in ICU and I have gained the greatest respect and admiration for nurses. 
Their ability to remain calm and clinical, yet caring and compassionate is a very admirable quality.

It's now day 16 and we are still in the hospital awaiting further results to determine the plan. After a shaky start, his progress has improved and he was able to move out of ICU to a lesser critical care floor.

From day 1, an internal medicine/hospitalist physician was assigned to coordinate with the team of specialists (cardiologist, neprologist, pulmonary etc.)
Each day, each doctor would communicate with us at different times of the day, and then the hospitalist would help sum things up for us later in the day.

Our hospitalist was changed on day 12, but that relates to changes we made to our insurance carriers. We loved the first hospitalist, but there may be a personality conflict with the 2nd. However, at this point our confidence in his expertise outweighs our issue with his personality.

We are confident in the doctors assigned to our case, and we are overall happy with the facility.

It is a hospital run by humans (not robots) who are highly skilled in their fields and specialties - and I think those humans are top notch - especially the nurses :-)",4

Here's the story-I'm an out-of-towner suffer an injury and transported by ambulance to this hellhole. I wait on a board for over an hour and 45 minutes - almost peed myself waiting for a nurse to see me - waited forever for a doctor to finally see me and tell me that I had a concussion.  I'm telling you I would've called out on all fours to get out of that place. Not a lot of friendly staff I think my husband encountered two friendly people out of that whole place.  I truly hope that Las Vegas has better medical facilities in this place. Because my advice if you're injured bleeding or need a heart transplant get yourself on a plane and get the heck out of there if this hospital is your only choice.,1
163748,4_Jui68k8m-zhTTyYB6ssw,YWIDquDD5n7L7VWD6D4mig,"The MountainView ER staff is probably one of the worst examples of patient care I have EVER encountered. They bully and abuse their patients, gang up on them, challenge their integrity, and then act like the patient is out of control when they become upset with the absolutely horrible treatment they have received. As a patient in this hospital last year, I was literally surrounded by  staff threatening to manhandle me. When I fell, one of them kicked me in the leg telling me to get up. You know what happened when I reported it? Absolutely nothing. The advocate said I was lying because no one substantiated my claim, as if people who have enacted wrongdoings in groups have never told the same lie to protect one another. The patient advocate's utter ineptitude is just insult to injury. Lacking all common sense and higher cognitive abilities, she for some reason could not get her narrow mind to entertain the idea that the patient might be telling the truth and the staff were merely trying not to get fired. Either way, this hospital leaves more than much to be desired, it is substandard and subhuman. Today when I needed my mother to be with me, the little Gestapo force they employ as security would not let her come to me, although I did not have anyone else in the room. Eventually, with WAY too much drama for a simple act of allowing a mother to be with her sick child, she came back to my room. My mom told them I still needed care but Doctor Behl was ""comfortable"" with sending me home while vomiting and in pain.  So today I  was in the ER here at MountainView and they treated me terribly. They essentially told my mom that my pain did not matter because the doctor was comfortable.  I have barely eaten anything all day and my blood sugar is now 738, despite the insulin my mom  has been giving  me. I  I am going into DKA, in severe pain and have to go back to the hospital because MountainView ER refused to treat me properly.  If you need them to save your life, rest assured, they will let you down",1

No pain medication was given, only blood was drawn within that lengthy time period. The ER admitting staff were incredibly rude and unhelpful. Like others have said it's mostly obnoxious gossiping going on behind that counter. The first question I tried to ask was interrupted by the admissions receptionist and given an unprofessional snappy remark in response. I work at both Sunrise and UMC hospitals so I understand how stressful the job can be but the waiting room had maybe 5 other people in it calmly and quietly waiting. No need to give unwarranted attitude. The recent renovations may have made the place look nicer, but this hospital is an awful waste of time and money.

They are pleased that I'm double covered by culinary, no surprise. I'm a guaranteed payment.. A damn crack head was treated better then I was today. The ER Dr huffed and puffed at me, raised his voice and walked out during conversation. Said he'll determine my pain. Very un professional establishment in the ER at Mountain View Hospital. Radiology and ultrasound tech were nice but the ER dr was a prick.. I do not recommend this location for treatment.. Your better off buying meds off the street cause they sure as hell won't prescribe what you need.

I was treated nicely and professionally by everyone who I had any contact with that afternoon. The ER was experiencing a very high rate of patients coming in. Due to that reason a couple of us were on beds near the nurses station so that she could better watch us. I did have to ask for more information than was voluntarily given and that's a shortcoming that seems to be common in medicine today. What it means is try to know what's going on or have someone do it for you.
In any case I was fixed up and referred to a specialist. Things did go slow, but I was paid attention to and never felt forgotten. 
I did see several apparently unconscious patients brought in that afternoon by the LVFD and quickly moved to what must be the critical care section. It seems to me if they have confidence in the ER we can too.
Given that, people should give useful, specific feedback to the hospital. That's one way to keep improving medical care in Las Vegas.",4

So once i got into the room The nurse asked me how many times have I threw up and i said very close to 30 times and she said i think your stretching the truth...WHAT!!! But since I was in to much pain to respond to her i just laid there crying still in pain.So finally she came back in and said okay I have 2 shots and some pills to go under your tongue and after she gave them to me she said ill be back in 10 minutes to check on you. Well she came back and though I was not in as much pain but still very nauseous she said do you feel better I stated a little and she said ""GOOD NOW I NEED YOU TO GET UP BECAUSE I NEED THE ROOM"" this was the most unprofessional thing you can say to a patient. What they didnt know is I have been in the medical/dental field for over 15 years and would never say something as such to a patient and make them feel as horrible as they made me feel. I over heard a lady say did you get her medicaid card....REALLY i never said i had medicaid I pay for my insurance and it is GOOD but i know I will never go back again and if possible I will take this situation to FOX 5 News because no one deserves to be treated the way i was NO ONE!!!!!!!!!!!!",1

After an hour's wait, they took her up to the 3rd floor for observation and testing.  At the beginning when the floor was fully staffed, everything was fine. They had no private room available, so my brother, who sometimes stays with her when she's in the hospital overnight in a private room, could not.  So we left. 

As the night wore on, my mom feeling weak had asked for someone who help her go to the bathroom. As a precaution, they put a diaper on her. Three times, my mom said she pushed the button and the nurse said sh'e be there.  What we didn't know was that, for whatever reason, they were understaffed.  My mom wet her diaper and it stayed on wet for hours.  As a result, the doctor came in the following morning and said she had the beginnings of a urinary tract infection.

Cleanliness:

Hospitals are always clean, & they should stay that way.

Service(s):

The employees could be nicer, but they deal with different attitudes everyday, so I know where they're coming from.

They've got antibacterial wall dispensers which are a plus but probably more of a necessity.

The waiting time is pretty bad, and it didn't seem like there were a lot of people to wait on/for.

My husband was there for 25 days in January and February. By and large, the care was decent. The room was cleaned regularly, the staff was friendly, the food was acceptable. They do rehab about an hour a day if the patient is up to it. The rehab staff was very good and accommodated each patients capabilities.  I found the case worker to be very good about following up. Patients families can eat for a reasonable amount everyday except weekends.  There was a small problem and the hospital followed up and corrected the situation. I found that they were anxious to provide good service and listened to complaints. I would recommend Complex Care if you have a complex medical situation and need extended care. I especially liked Dr Pernell who runs the rehab department. I was also happy that I was allowed to bring our dog to visit.  It was a good boost for my husband's mood.",4

We ended up just leaving - but they never took her insurance information (dummies), and sent her a ridiculous bill for hundreds of dollars just for the privledge of sitting around and being denied medical care.  The nursing staff who worked there were completely unsympathetic and inhospitable.  These nurses were cruel gatekeepers to the actual doctors.  Everyone who worked there seemed to hate their job and were unwilling to do anything other than the bare minimum.  

The ER was packed with people and some girl was puking in those pink plastic basins while waiting.   A janitor came by and cleaned ONE CHAIR and ignored an entire row of empty seats.  Sounds sanitary, huh?  I wonder how many already sick people get sicker because the germs they are exposed to while waiting to get medical attention.

A few months later, I had a medical emergency and I went to Southern Hills hospital instead.  I was immediately checked in, was seen by a doctor and put on an IV in the first 20 minutes, and I was checked into the hospital in less than two hours.  The ER room there was empty because it is a much less residential part of town.   I also hear that San Martin Hospital on Warm Springs near Durango has a good ER.

They built so many houses in Summerlin and then didn't think that they should have a big enough hospital to accommodate all the people.  It's ridiculous and I will always make the extra drive to another hospital.",1

However, somewhere from the ER into Intensive Care, quality of service dropped immensely.  It was many hours before we knew the room assignment. The head nurse the next day called at 6 AM  asking questions like ""What brand of pacemaker does the patient have?"" Excuse me nurse, we sent you the medical records and most people don't know the brand of their pacemaker. They weren't awake when it was installed.""  I wish I had taken that call.  ""What planet are you on, nurse?""

Then in asking them, ""What is the course of treatment?"" The nurse didn't know.  It took them two days to tell us.  The doctor had written all that info down, but they ""Lost it"". Not a comfortable feeling when a relative's life is in danger.  They took some unneeded tests that were already taken elsewhere. (Additional procedures means more money). The waiting rooms weren't very clean or comfortable. We complained to the doctor, and he said, ""Sorry about the lack of communication.  But this hospital struggles with that all the time"". In fact, he said, ""I'm from California, and the medical system in LV is one of the most challenging I've seen.""  Great, thanks for the info.

1. The BirthPlace at Summerlin hospital is awesome.  We had our third son there a few years ago and it was a completely different experience than having them at UMC.  This place was top notch, from their doctors, the rooms and nurses, to the building itself.

2. The ER - Any ER is going to be going to be doing triage and taking the more serious cases first.  That would include life threatening injuries/conditions or how much pain you are having.  Unfortunately a family member had some health issues and a considerable amount of pain that was apparent.  She was taken care of promptly.  Other times when we went for a baby having a high fever, we did wait a little while, but that all has to go with the severity of the case.

3. The Cafeteria - Oh my gosh!  This place had the best food. I recently  visited this place as a family member was having surgery and I decided to get a bite to eat.  The cafeteria was awesome.  A double bacon cheeseburger, fries and drink for under $8.  It was one of the best burgers I had in a long time.  I joke with my wife that we should go eat in the cafeteria sometimes when we can't decide what to do.

Also let me add that we haven't been to every hospital in Vegas, but we've been to damn near all of them. With all that said i'll tell you right now my father will only admit himself to two, Summerlin, and St. Rose. 

I'd say hands down that Summerlin is the best hospital in the city, for grownups at least. It certainly is probably the prettiest hospital. The staff are courteous and nice, and the triage is pretty good at prioritizing.

I spent a total of 4 days here and I have to say that the nurses on both the day and night shifts were excellent.  I was confined to isolation so I wasn't allowed to walk around but they made sure to check on me and provide a little bit of chitchat just so I wouldn't go insane staring at the four walls.  (You can only watch so much TV in a hospital!) They were very professional and provide comfort to the best of their abilities. They responded very quickly anytime I had to use the call button. They were sure to explain what they were doing during my care and what medications they were providing me for my symptoms.

She fractured her elbow and knee, and did a little damage to the bones in her face under her right eye.  All her damage was to the right side of her body.  Of course when the paramedics arrived, they seemed suspicious, I guess they thought I might be a wife beater, given the circumstances, I can't really blame them.
Well, the experience in the emergency room was just okay, I almost felt as if the staff were indifferent to her situation.  They seemed quite non-nonchalant, but Suzy did receive all the X -rays that were required.

That night she was checked into the general ward, she had her own private room, bonus, and the facilities are quite nice.  The next few days were the most interesting.  I spent several hours the first few days and then an entire day on day 5 and 6.  The nurses, that's what they call themselves, seemed indifferent to the patients needs.  On day 5 I took it upon myself to wash Suzie's hair and change her sheets, pillow cases and the whole enchilada.  During those two days, I emptied her comode several times.  
The charge nurse on duty, some little chunky troll, was about as pleasant as the grim reaper.  The doctor assigned to Suzy, was nothing short of great, empathetic, concerned and really a caring individual, kudos to him, he'll be one of the few greats.

The standing joke in Las Vegas is this, if you need medical treatment in Las Vegas, you go to the airport, why, to fly to California where you can get decent medical treatment.  Why would you become a nurse if you weren't compassionate and interested in caring for patients.  The nurses at the hospital seemed more interested in chatting with each other than they did caring for their patients.  Overall, a great facility, but less than impressive staff.",2

I'm freakin out because my son is bleeding profusely and I need to get him to the ER ASAP. Well the recording gave me no help, so I try to get an operator. No, I get hung up on! I call back and press the 0 and get a lady who has no clue where RAMPART is... really? Ok Ive lived here for only almost a year and the majority of that was off flamingo by Spring Valley. She has NO CLUE how to get there, she does not know where the Summerlin library is and has me crying and freaking out.

I finally figure out how to get there ON MY OWN and rush him into the ER. They triage him and the whole 9, we sit and wait for an open room in the pediatric area of the ER and watch TV. We finally get called back, we only had to wait like 15mins but this is where the rest of our night begins. I know normally you can be in the ER for a few hours, but shoot we were there for 5 hours! We both hadn't eaten since like 2 and it was already 10pm! The nurses come in and check out my son, he had a deep laceration and needed to get stitched up. They put numbing cream on him, patch him back up and we are left to wait for the dr. She finally comes in and evaluates him and tell me hes gonna need stitches... ok! LOL. 

Basically we end up waiting abother 2 hrs for the doctor to come and stitch him up, he needed some happy meds so that way they can actually stitch him up. I adv them hes probably gonna need a full dose, bc if hes like me I need like 2wice a regular person. It took a mighty long time but the staff was pretty nice.

The only thing I would suggest is that you practice evidence based care. Do not force your patients who don't get an epidural to lay flat on their backs for 8hours of labor, don't threaten c section for ""failure to progress"" because labor isn't moving in your particular time frame, and definitely don't push epidural after every contraction.",3

My last two days in the hospital I was ignored by the nursing staff even though they knew I needed routine care and vital checks.

Our first call to the nurse took 30 min to get a drink of water.  Our 2nd call for meds took over 1 hour.  When I went to the nurses station to ask what the hold up was our nurse informed us that Lisa did not tell our her that we called. That happened more then once where the person didn't tell our nurse we called. The night shift was definitely worse than the day shift. Next day, we decided to check out early.  We told the nurse we were ready to check out 3 times.  Each time she said she would be there in just a min.  Each time we asked she also acted as if it was the first time we were asking.  
I could understand if the nurses were busy but hardly any patients were there and I often noticed the nurses sitting around talking.   We could have received better service in a 3rd world country.  They even forgot to remove the clip on the umbilical  cord before discharge.

But after getting kicked out of the hospital that I was pre registered at my doctor sent me to Summerlin telling me that the charge nurse was ready for me there with a room. Sure enough I get there and they knew exactly who I was and I was sent to a room ASAP. When you are in labor you don't want to mess around. It was a bit chaotic on that Sunday so I had a bunch of nurses that came in and took down my medical history. I finally did get one L&D nurse named Shannon who was pretty great. She explained to me everything that was going on and what she was doing and she really took the time to make sure I understood what was what. I felt well taken care but she had to leave and I was assigned the night nurse. The night nurse was ok, but Shannon definitely stood out among the many L&D nurses that I had that day. 
After my C-Section, I was in the hospital for a couple of days and you get to meet a lot of new nurses in Postpartum. Mary and Kristen (baby RN) were a great team! I had another nurse that I really liked as well, but her name has escaped my sleep deprived brain since I only had her one day. Being in the hospital is not fun and by the 2nd day I was ready to be discharged regardless of the awesome nursing staff. My one complaint is that after I was in labor for 19 hours and then went through the c-section ordeal, they were making me sign papers a couple of hours after surgery. I know it's probably standard protocol but I was up for 24 hours by then and exhausted.

Overall, I was really impressed with the nursing staff.  They regularly checked on me and always asked if I needed anything.  I was in a lot of pain so it was very appreciated.  My experience here was night and day from Mountainview Hospital (the hospital I checked out of to go to Summerlin).  I would go back in a heartbeat.

Moral of the story:  If you feel like you're getting insufficient care at a hospital, leave and go to another one.  It may save your life.",4

I've heard a couple of horror stories about this ER but I figured sh** happens. Anyways it was New Year's Eve and my baby's pediatricians office was closed. The on call nurse told us to go to a hospital with a pediatric ER doc. Summerlin obviously had a pediatrician in the ER so that's where we went. The waiting room wasn't very full when I got there. I thought ok in and out in a hour to a hour and a half. I ended up waiting there for over 3 hours just for the doctor to see us for 2 minutes and say oh I'm just gonna give you antibiotics. She didn't even bother taking a culture sample. I felt so rushed I didn't even get a chance to ask questions. She just said this antibiotic is good for killing this. I had to wait another 20 min for the prescription. Luckily the discharge area was a bit easier and efficient. I left with my 4 month old drained, tired and poorer. 

I had scheduled an appointment for my baby with her doctor and it turns out since the doctor didn't even bother taking a culture the antibiotics didn't even work for this strain of bacteria. That's scary since I had told the ER doc that she had a SERIOUS bacterial infection that had come back which could happen according to my baby's doctor. If you decide to come here make sure the doctors do their due diligence. Make them take cultures, etc even if you have to chase them down the hall. 

PS. I think you guys should put disinfecting wipes in the waiting room so that we can wipe down the seats and handles as there are people with pneumonia, etc in that room and a lot of babies were in that room that day.",1
167912,JrR8xamY_fcNYYRL6VGv_w,XzInO2PCkP-e3_Y2dpYSRw,"This review is for the AntePartum department of the Maternity Ward (2nd floor). EXCELLENT STAFF- RN's, CNA's, and doctors. 

Through the years, I'd heard many good things about the Maternity department. I had pre-registered online in my 35th week (site is user-friendly- a plus)- there was a possibility mentioned by the High Risk Pregnancy Center, so I wanted to be prepared. Towards the last few days of week 35- on a friday, my OB-GYN advised me to go to the hospital because my BP was too high, 160s. 

I checked in, went into the surgery triage room, and waited for the perinatologist (high risk pregnancy center) to determine what to do next. The doctors and nurses (rn's- mary, nancy, chris, etc. & cna's) were all very nice- they would keep us informed. We were waiting to hear from the perinatologist who would do an ultrasound and a review of the recent findings (from the HRPC); finally it was determined- I was scheduled to deliver on sunday. The food (the solids, anyway) was pretty good, too. (Note: the night before my surgery, we were able to borrow a wheelchair so that I could get some fresh air outside- the grounds are beautiful.)

I was able to get a room that night (all private?); mine had a view overlooking the valet and parking lot. The room was comfortable- a bed, a bedside table, several chairs- one that converted into a bed for the expecting father, a tv with a dvd player, a chest, a closet, and a bathroom. My husband brought me movies from home to watch, to keep me occupied. Housekeeping came daily, which was always a short visit. The hospital itself is very clean. And there was no weird creepy hospital smell either. 

I ended up staying a week (had never stayed overnight in a hospital before, nor had I been apart from my husband); though I had some little bumps (unfavorable medicine reactions- I am really sensitive and I had a lot of pain- I went through a lot). The nurses were right about encouraging me to walk the hallways, through my pain with the c-section surgery (it did get easier like they said), in order to get my system back to normal. I was under constant supervision- medicines, lots of monitoring- blood pressure, and testing- blood tests & 24 hour urine, so I wasn't able to get a lot of rest (plus my neighbors also had baby monitoring- the heartbeats were pretty loud). I was lucky if I had three hours straight sleep. I did receive excellent care, though I wasn't having the greatest time. Many doctors checked in with me- the doctors who delivered my son- Dr. Ghadisha & Dr. Maligaya, my own OB-GYN, Dr. Brathwaite (all with Southwest Medical Associates), and a couple other doctors I only saw once. 

The nursery was excellent as well. Our son received round-the-clock care and attention- though he came early, he was born healthy and normal- we were very lucky. The nurse would get him- heavy security (a good thing), and we would be able to have him in my room as long as we wanted. 

On the cafeteria food, the prices were pretty decent (minus the ice cream) and the food was pretty good, too. My husband went there many times, as he was here visiting me and the baby. BTW, Patients are not allowed in the cafeteria.

I should mention that the other parents/patients on the floor, were all very nice, too. There were some patients who had a really long stay- 37 days, six months. So, yes, looking back, my week's stay seemed short, in comparison. One couple gave us their preemie clothes, three outfits, which was very nice. They were told they would be having a preemie, but they had a 8-pound baby.   

My few complaints: the overwhelming thing is that everyone would come to the room at the same time- felt a little bombarded at times: the photographer- Bella, the welfare clerk- this was a mistake, as I had double coverage, the clerk to get our medical insurance information, the breastfeeding nurse, etc. And possibly another thing that was beginning to irritate me, the subject of post-partum depression would keep popping up (it wasn't that, though, I was extremely weak- the liquid diet wasn't helping, the medicines were really affecting me, and I wasn't getting much sleep, either- I just wanted to go home and get back to some normal version of myself). I understand the concern, though. The checkout process was very long- over 5 hours. The nurse told us she had to complete lots of paperwork, and in the final hour before we were able to leave, we went through discharge directions, signed the forms, and were given the TDAP shots (3-in-1). We were also given some supplies as well.  

To recap- excellent care, staff, nursery, clean facility, nice private rooms for maternity patients, good food in rooms and cafe, pre-registration process is user-friendly.",5
167913,TvCYRBu1xtTHhTRTE7l-kg,XzInO2PCkP-e3_Y2dpYSRw,"It's actually very hard to review this hospital fairly with one rating because one aspect of the visit was HORRIBLE and the other aspect of the visit was the total opposite. I am basing my star rating on my ER experience because I'm guessing that is more of what people would check reviews for.

The ER situation is atrocious. I've been in the hospital a LOT in my lifetime (unfortunately). I've lived in several states, experienced ERs in both private and public hospitals and I have NEVER had a wait as long as I did here. There was zero privacy for triage, there were absolutely not enough seats in the waiting areas and they had people who had been seen brought back out to continue waiting (I'm assuming for test results?) in the waiting room - some in hospital gowns, others in wheelchairs... who wants to be sitting half naked in a freezing waiting room??? I was in the waiting room for over three hours. At NO point in that time did anyone make an attempt to come out and perhaps look at disinfecting/cleaning after patients who had come and gone. I was not in with any time of infectious or contagious disease but there were people coughing, both adults and children vomiting into plastic bags all over the waiting room... who wants to sit in those seats after that?? The whole process is frustrating. You stand around waiting for someone to take your name. Then you wait to see triage. Then you wait SOME MORE to see someone in registration. Then - you guessed it - more waiting to see a doctor finally. 

Once I DID finally get into the actual ER, I was kept overnight and every single nurse and doctor I interacted with other than one was extremely kind and caring. The one nurse who was the exception seemed to hate his life - I could hear him complaining about the staff, the hospital, all of it, from my room. But everyone else was truly a blessing who made a horrible situation for me much more comfortable and I felt they really did care. 

Overall the medical staff at the hospital was fantastic. But if I ever had to go to the ER again, I highly doubt I would return here.",2
167914,arkULfS9ZFT58FNi1u6sHg,XzInO2PCkP-e3_Y2dpYSRw,"500th review!  Might as well be the hospital that brought my precious little baby into the world.  And I should probably write the review before I start duking it out with my health insurance company.  It always tries to get out of paying its share of the bills.

This hospital offers childcare and childbirth classes.  Both traditional and ""alternative"" childbirth classes. Not free but reasonably priced.  The classes my husband and I took were heavy on discussion, which was super helpful for me.  A lot of questions came up that I never thought to ask.  And in the child care class, they let us practice changing diapers, bathing and swaddling over and over on pretty accurate baby dolls (floppy and heavy).  My husband had never changed a diaper in his life, so this practice came in super handy when I was incapacitated after the birth.  Like Margret mentioned, the pre-registration process was super easy.  I got the paperwork at the free hospital tour, filled it out at home, and dropped it off.  They made copies of my insurance cards and I was good to go.

In terms of labor and delivery, there are good and bad aspects.  When I first checked in, I was put into triage which is a bunch of curtained beds.  There the nurses verified whether I was really ready to have the baby.  That took longer than I would have liked and we had to listen to other conversations about potential miscarriages that also came in for treatment.  They really should have a separate triage area for people who are having issues.  It's really awkward to hear people talking about such a sensitive subject and I'm sure the other patients didn't appreciate hearing about my perfectly healthy 39 week term baby on the way.

The delivery rooms and post partum rooms are private.  I seriously can't imagine how it would work any other way.  The delivery rooms are big, no windows, but really nice.  The post partum rooms are smaller but have a window. Each room, delivery or post partum, has its own restroom with shower stocked with basic toiletries (toothpaste, toothbrush, combo bathwash/shampoo).

In terms of my delivery, well, let's just say things don't always go as planned.  It was a rough recovery.  Most of the staff were extremely helpful, competent and nice.  However, with all things in life, there has to be a few crazies running around.  One nurse kept complaining to me that the rooms were not properly stocked.  Uh, I'm hooked up to an IV, I can't feel my legs, and yet I feel like a truck just hit me.  What the f*ck do you want me to do about it?!? Thankfully the nurses changed at least every 12 hours.  The most annoying thing was that the nurses all had very different advice about child care.  Very confusing for a first time, sleep-deprived mom.  I know opinions differ, but it would be great if they all had a pow wow and developed a party line on certain crucial issues.

And a Yelp review would not be complete if I didn't critique the food.  Some of it was pretty crappy.  Do NOT get the cheeseburger.  And the fries were awful as well.  The low-sodium tomato soup was super sweet - yuck.  But the chicken tenders were tasty (ask for extra ranch dressing) and I had a special farfelle with meatballs which was pretty good. There was a Nutrition Room in post partum where patients and their significant others can help themselves to pudding, jello, sandwiches, popsicles, etc.  Most of the food in the Nutrition Room was super sweet, surprisingly enough. But food on demand is available.

I can't give it five stars, but it was a pretty good experience for me under the circumstances.",4

The rooms here are very spacious and the hospital is very clean the staff was very helfpful in answering our questions.

The one thing that stuck out to me the most and the only reason that we did not go with Summerlin for our delivery, was simply because it seemed so fast paced. Even the nurse explained to us that summerlin can easily deliver 50-75 babies a month to where other hospitals will only do 20-30.",3
167918,4XX96LOFlvPy_0ZrBEEzFA,XzInO2PCkP-e3_Y2dpYSRw,"Where do I begin? I will start by saying that I have been going to summerlin hospital since I found out that I was pregnant. They offer many birthing classes. I attending natural birth methods, breast feeding basics, and a car seat safety check.  The price of the classes were under $60 and the car seat check and brith tour were both free.
I have birth to my daughter here and was very impressed with the nursing staff. Everyone was extremely nice and made me feel safe and appreciated. I felt like a person not a patient.
 The delivery room was large with a tv and private bathroom. There was enough seating for up to 6 guests.  The postpartum room was about half the size of the delivery room but comfy. There is one lounge for someone to stay the night with you that folded down into a sleeper. We asked for sheets and a pillow and the nurse actually made up the bed for my husband.  It is a requirement that the hospital keep you for 24hours after natural birth (longer if C-Section). 
The food was not that great but its free.  I also liked how they brought a celebration dessert with sparkling cider and flutes to toast! That was a surprising treat!
I kept saying that it was like The Four Seasons hospital because of how clean and professional everything was. It was a great a great experience and highly recommend delivering at the hospital. 

The ER room is why I gave 4 stars. There was no sense in urgency when I had a newborn that needed to be seen . There was only one person assisting in the ER. Once we were in the room to be seen by the doctor ER waiting 45 mins. That wad too long to wait with a 4 week old. I will not return to this ER again!",4
167919,wKv6Qx4ZZ-oUgIfLQXZihQ,XzInO2PCkP-e3_Y2dpYSRw,"Terrible! Don't believe all the hype. This is for OB.  The tour sounded great, of coarse once we actually had the baby totally different story.   The nurse told me they ran out of pillows. How does a hospital run out of pillows? Then she yelled at my spouse to not help me sit up when i needed his help because her lazy ass would not help me. She literally stuck me in a room and left me there.  I was just lucky that my wonderful mom who is also a nurse from a different hospital came to help me. 

Thank god the shifts changed and they replaced my terrible nurse with an amazing one (she gets five stars).  

So did things get better after I had the baby? No! More terrible nurses came to pretend help me.  One nurse even said she needs to take my baby because the labs are running behind then walked out of the room with my baby. Which i was told on the tour would never happen.
I called my husband and made him hunt her down and bring the baby back.

They forgot to get me my dinner, its okay i only just delivered. 

One nurse told me my baby was too cold and took the baby to warm the baby up after she blamed me for it. Then came back and said that she could not get my babies body temp up and gave the baby back to me. You know why!?!  Because my baby was not COLD!!!! 

One woman, who was nice but annoying spent a hour trying to get my baby to latch. My baby would not because she was SLEEPY!! Once the nursing police left my baby latched on her own 5 hours later.

So overall...staff was lazy, rude, annoying, incompetent, and pushy.

I honestly hope that neither you nor your loved ones would ever need to go to the ER but if you do, avoid this place like the plague.

This is the WORST medical establishment I've ever been to, staffed and run by incompetent clowns. Everyone with whom I encountered from the check-in staff through the nurses to the PA was grossly unprofessional. 

The wait is also horrible, 4.5+ hours before being seen by a doctor? Seriously?? And ""being seen"" means his glancing at you for 5 seconds??? In fact, the wait was so long that by the time I was finally seen by the doctor, they had managed to loose my test sample they collected upon my arrival.

Oh, and do not expect privacy - it's non-existent there. Also, do not expect to be treated like a human being at Summerlin Hospital. What you can expect is overhearing nurses discussing their meal preferences at Chipotle as well as gossiping and making fun of patients after their departure (but still in front of other patients that are still there.) You can also hear nurses mocking patients that are in pain or loudly counting down the remaining time of their shift or complaining about their job. They also act offended if they are called to the patient's room. What a joke. Even the doctor was complaining that he needs to deal with 17-20 patients at a time. Whose fault is that??? Mine??? Not really but I was certainly paying for that with my time.

To top it off, I also had to witness one of the nurses complain about how ""nothing works here"", which surely didn't help me re-establish trust in this facility. When I asked the nurse about the necessity of a certain procedure, she just shrugged her shoulder and answer: ""This is what he [the doctor] orders for everyone.""

167922,RK5gqgNUzY9OEwAO-GOdFg,XzInO2PCkP-e3_Y2dpYSRw,"This review is not for the Summerlin Hospital rather the Medical Center attached to it. 

Summerlin Hospital Medical Center gets 5-stars by default due to the fact that it is home to Dr. Scott MacLeod. Dr. MacLeod cured me of an auto-immune disorder that the medical profession claims there is no cure for. So what the hell does this mean??? Is MacLeod Jesus or something? Because all I know is that my auto-immune disorder must have ascended to heaven after he was done with it. 

Summerlin Medical Center is really ritzy, clean, and technologically advanced. The Doctors here are no joke. Log off yelp and do your research for a bit.... google every Doctor with a private practice in this area. 90% of them got their medical degrees from overseas Med Schools located in places like Portugal, Uzbekistan, England, and the Caribbean. Most states will not allow individuals with degrees from those schools to practice. Nevada is one of the only states that allows unaccredited MDs from these Euro schools to practice. Now, google every doctor at the Summerlin Medical Center....you will see that all of them went to the very best medical schools in the united states. For example, Dr. MacLeod went to Western University of Health Sciences in Pomona California, which is fully accredited in all 50 states and rated by every major medical accreditation organization as the #1 school for Osteopathic surgery and medicine. This is practically the ""Harvard Law"" of D.O. medical degrees. It's the best you can get. And that's the kind of Doctor you get here. 

I recently went to an Urgent Care in Spring Valley which had all 5-star reviews from the Elite Squad. This place had a doctor who got his degree in South America. I spent the next 2 weeks recovering from adverse effects from a medication that hasn't been widely prescribed since world war II. Hey elites, Thanks a bunch! Did you guys 5-star the Doctor because he had a Taiwanese shaved ice machine in the waiting room and was giving out free meal vouchers for Yonaka or something?",5

Collete was the grave nurse which was very helpful and funny, making jokes like pardon for the undies which you wear afterwards and called it ""Frederick's of summerlin"" just little things that takes your mind off the pain.

After a terribly painful drive to the hospital I limped into the lobby and collapsed in pain right at the check in counter.

After a few tests and questions they determined it was safe to give me something for the pain through the I.V. before the CT scan. Sweet baby Jesus! I don't know what was in that stuff but I sure didn't feel pain after that! 

After hours of pain (which was my fault for waiting for so long before going into the ER) I was finally able to rest comfortably while they did the C.T. scan and a few other tests. 

The Nurse: 5 Stars: She was great! She was attentive, she kept me informed on what was going on and what the next steps were going to be and also very professional.....not to mention probably one of the most beautiful women in Las Vegas. 

The Doctor: 5 Stars: She  was very informative and had excellent bed side manner. I was a nervous wreck, the Doc managed to calm me down and tell me that everything was going to be ok, (which took a bit of convincing because i thought my insides were exploding and it was game over for me)

 I also loved the food, which is very rare at an ER. The Pizza was hot and fresh, and the workers there asked the person in front of me if she had enough Ranch? Whaaa? LOL
 I used their Phone Registration, and she was very nice, helpful, and sympathetic. You have to preregister three days in advance if you do it online but for emergancies they will do it by phone, then a quick run in to get the bloodwork done. Bing Bam Boom, done.",5

Extremely disappointed form what we were told at the tour. ""Fathers get one meal"" the meals itself is a challenge in it's own to try and get! Went in @ midnight to get induced. Had baby boy @ 11 am. I know you are not to eat durning labor (which was not the issue) Was I served lunch at 1 with all the other pts on our floor... No. Was I offered dinner? NO! I had to have my husband ask the nurse for a tray for me finally 8 hours post delivery I was able to eat. They had stated ""Dads get one meal a day."" This would have been nice but yet when we asked about his, we were told ""I'll see if there are extras""... And never heard anything back. Daddy was able to get food from the cafeteria but it's the principle..  Dad was NOT able to eat any meals from the hospital. 
2nd they ARE OUT OF EVERYTHING!!! 
we had transferred to postpartum we had NO PILLOWS! When we asked she said they were out!!? Thankfully we had my mother being some but what the heck!? 
And as far as pads for mom bring your own! 
They had no pads in stock either! I literally had to use the chuck pads they use in the bed ""folded in 4ths"" per the nurse!! What the heck!     My last child was born at St. Rose. Extremely more caring for their patients!! You get to stay in 1 room the entire stay! And they have what they need for their patients",1

Nurses were great, a lot of them had just been transferred from Valley due to their maternity ward closing. Yanet was my nurse for pre-delivery, and she assisted in the actual procedure as well. My son was brought to me and wheeled next to me on the way to post-partum room. After they checked his bilirubin levels, I was informed that he had to be taken to the nursery because his jaundice was a little too high. I was told that he would be in there overnight, and would be back in the room with me in the morning when the sun came out. I used that time to get a few hours sleep, and come the next morning he still wasn't in the room. I asked for an update around 11AM that day, and was told he would be in soon. Finally around 3PM I walk out to the nurse's station very annoyed to see what was going on with my son. My nurse called over to the nursery to let them know she would be bringing me over. Suddenly her tone of voice changed, and she sounded frustrated with whoever was on the other end of the phone. She told me to go to my room and a doctor would be right in to talk to me. I work in healthcare, so this scared the hell out of me. I walked back to my room and was crying before the doctor came in. I was informed that my son had been moved to the NICU because he wasn't keeping any milk down. They took my husband and I over to see him and he was already surrounded by nurses about to have an IV put in for fluids. So basically if I hadn't gone to ask what was going on, this would have been happening without me knowing. I was very upset obviously, crying and scared. Once everything calmed down, the NICU nurses and doctors were very helpful and supportive. The following morning the charge nurse came in to ask me what happened and to apologize for the lack of communication. My son was in the NICU for 4 days, and I was able to stay an extra day because of that so that I could pump and bring milk to him. All in all, my experience with Summerlin was great, except for the communication issue. I got a call before every meal asking what my husband and I would like to eat. They have private post partum rooms, and the food is decent. They even bring a little dessert tray that says Congratulations from the staff. I only knocked off one star for my issue because the care my son and I received was amazing.",4

167938,Q-RWr6xcOKg7vB-vzUUmcQ,XzInO2PCkP-e3_Y2dpYSRw,"My husband and I debated for a very long time on whether to choose Summerlin or Southern Hills hospital as both maternity ward tours we went on went well and we really didn't see a difference in the two hospitals. We decided on Summerlin since they accepted both my insurances and we are so happy with our decision. With this being our first child, we didn't know what to expect from the hospital experience and was pleasantly surprised.

My doctor scheduled to induce me Wednesday 10pm so I picked up the preregistration paperwork a few days early so that was one less thing we had to worry about. We arrived to the hospital around 9pm and it only took the registration receptionist fifteen minutes to get us entered into the system. We then headed to the Labor and Delivery ward where we were a bit early so they asked us to wait in the waiting room while they prepared my L&D room. About fifteen minutes later, Nurse Ester stopped by the waiting room to escort and check us into our room. The L&D room we were placed in was enormous, clean and very comfortable; I had probably around thirteen people in the room comfortably at one time during labor and after delivery.

Because I wasn't given Pitocin until 10amish the next day, my husband and I were able to sleep the night before and prepare for L&D the next day. Nurse Heather G. relieved Nurse Ester from the point I started having strong contractions to delivery and I cannot express how much I appreciated her. I believe Nurse Heather was one of the main reasons my husband and I had such a great experience with L&D. She did an amazing job with communicating everything that was going on, was very positive during the time we thought there was a chance we may have to result to a c-section if I didn't dilate to 10cm sooner than later, and just showed her overall care and compassion. Nurse Heather started delivery for me until my doctor arrived and did a great job with leading me through pushing exercises that resulted in me only having to push a few times before my baby girl came out. She was the perfect nurse to have since my husband and I did not attend any Lamaze or childbirth classes prior.

After our daughter was born, Nurse Heather assisted with moving me to the postpartum room which was smaller than the L&D room but still very roomy for my husband and me, along with a couple visitors. The nurses in postpartum were just as caring and not once did my husband or I feel we were inconveniencing any of the nurses and they were all so hospitable. My husband even mentioned our stay resembling one of a hotel stay, with better service than many of the hotels we've stayed at. We were even given an extended menu for our meals in case we were craving something other than the special of the day and were sent desserts and Perrier with plastic flutes to ""celebrate"" our new baby. 

All in all, if you are having difficulty choosing a hospital, I highly recommend Summerlin Hospital and hope you have the same experience. We live in Green Valley and will not hesitate on going back to Summerlin Hospital when we have our second child.",5

I never saw a doctor until discharge. Dr. Bird was dirty, unkempt, and apathetic at best. I had extreme knee pain and obvious injury. My knee was not touched once. They did nothing to tell me what was wrong. The ordered minimal x-rays and did not x-ray my ribs even though I had abrasions and pain. The only medical attention I was given were x-rays and pain medication. I was told to go see a primary care doctor and they can tell me what was wrong. The doctor and staff were all very rude and the doctor wouldn't even shake my hand. I would avoid Dr. Bird at all costs. After looking him up after the fact there is a reason he is one of the worst rated doctors in town. Avoid him and this place at all costs.

As I said in my review of Magee Women's Hospital, no one really wants to go.  But when you do have to go, it's good to know that you will receive excellent care.

I was in the ER here recently as an outpatient.  I wiped out on my bicycle (yes, I was wearing my helmet!) and sprained my ankle.*  I was taken to the ER here, and even though I had a bit of wait--I was not a life or death case--I received respectful, kind care from the staff here.  People who work in an ER are under a lot of stress, but everyone here was wonderful from the nurse to the doctor to the X-ray technician.

The follow-up care was good too.  I spent a week on crutches, then I was given the boot after my first follow-up visit.  They referred me to a sports-medicine therapist and gave me suggested exercises to do.  I went last week to check the progress and the doctor was pleased with the healing process.

The staff was very helpful and understanding of the whole situation and duration of his stay. I was very thankful to all the nurses and doctors who were so great and made sure my friend was out and healthy in a timely manner. 

Thanks to the UPMC staff! Keep up the great work!",5
178438,BNLHHh_mYBwbGJ25BbIT8A,p4R_85lf1om4ndYJLVgc_g,"UPMC is truly world class medicine - it just is - speaking from experience as a patient AND as a healthcare worker. 

UPMC makes up a whole hospital system that has several main hospitals and out laying clinics in Pittsburgh and around the world. They have hospitals in Italy, Ireland, Egypt, etc... and in Pittsburgh alone, looking at Hillman Cancer Center, Shadyside, Presby, etc... its fantastic. 

I have worked at Shadyside and Presby - I can't speak ill on either one. Presby is truly a world of its own, though. Its *massive* and is comprised of MANY intensive care units - neuro/trauma, CCU, surgical ICU, cardiothoracic ICU, liver transplant ICU, medical ICU, etc... The population at presby is VERY sick - they take on clients that no one else will touch because of surgeries being high risk, etc.. and they give patients a chance. 

The nurses are EXCEPTIONAL, very smart, very well educated and very on top of things, if not overworked and understaffed which is more of a state of the nation, not so much a UPMC specific problem. But when nursing is understaffed, patient care suffered and patient satisfaction drops. 

The docs are also really excellent. I only worked in the intensive care units there, but I can honestly say that I would send my family there in a heart beat. 

Parking is really expensive, they do have vallet services which is great for the ER needs as well. The cafeteria is really big and on the top floor. Presby also bridges over to the eye and ear institute and montifore hospital. They are a level 1 trauma center, heart, lung, liver transplant center... When I was there, they were not a burn center, however. 

Really sick? Need great care? - Go to UPMC. I would move back across the country to get care in Pittsburgh - thats how much faith I have in their medical practices.",5
178439,oa7OTM-sNFH0l1j1Q7LUFQ,p4R_85lf1om4ndYJLVgc_g,"UPMC Presby is one of the worst hospitals I have ever experienced.  I went into the trauma unit after a car wreck.  I was yelled at, degraded and humiliated. I needed to use the bathroom and they insisted I use a bed pan because i wasn't supposed to move my neck.  They jerked my back and neck around far worse than i would have if i had been helped to stand up, but whatever.  They brought the bed pan and demanded that  go or they would catheterize me.  They said it as a threat and kept telling me how much it would hurt me if i made them catheterize me.  I wasn't being uncooperative, I simply didn't need to go that bad.  Especially after they had humiliated me and lifted me up, bare-butt to the world for everyone to see...not medical personnel, other people in the room who had nothing to do with anything except building maintenance. Dehumanizing.  After being threatened into forcing myself to pee in that bedpan, the woman spilled the urine all over me and my bed.  I was forced to lay in my own wet filth for almost two hours.  It burned my skin and literally gave me a diaper rash.

Then, I had gone without food at doctors orders for more than 15 hours on top of being brought into trauma very hungry, so probably 24 hours total.  When finally I was cleared by the doctor to eat, it took the staff more than four hours to get me food.  I ended up sending a friend from his house to a local restaurant.  He was 15 miles away and had to fight traffic.  He still beat the staff at bringing me food.  It was a truly horrendous experience. 

Humiliating. Disgusting.  No respect for patients as real people.  I would rather visit a witch doctor with a rusty saw blade than ever go back.",1

Highly disappointed in so many things about this experience with Dr Kanter's office at UPMC Presby. He may be a good surgeon, but this system sucks.",1
178441,5zF5rcyZOHMwzE42xu4yJQ,p4R_85lf1om4ndYJLVgc_g,"As a sickly and regular patient/customer, I really think I can review a hospital, but must concede the great diversity and relativity of experiences within a hospital among the diseased, injured,... dying etc.  There's so much going on in a hospital perhaps one can only relate their own experiences.  

I had a pretty basic surgical experience here, which was a Vascular Decompression surgery for trigeminal neuralgia.  Basically they cut away skin and muscle from my temporal and occipital bones, drilled a hole in my skull and placed padding between the fifth cranial nerve and some 'offending' artery.  The surgeon did what appears at this time to be a great job.  My scar is very small compared to patients of other neurosurgeons, so my review here, is an attempt at an accurate account of my hospital stay and experience.  

The waiting room and time were fine for my experience, but the negative aspects would be the lack of pain management, uncomfortable recovery, and the bossy nurses.  Currently, one week after my surgery I am managing my pain with Tylenol and whisky.  I ran out of oxycodone today and apparently they do not refill it after 4:30pm.  

It must be standard operating procedure in the hospital business to supply the patient/customer with no more than one week of pain medication after surgery, which has been the case here.  In my opinion, it is immoral.  There are 1,000s of people out there in pain that cannot get relief.  After dozens of unrelated surgeries, I anticipate it, personally, but potential patients/customers here should be forewarned of UPMC's incompetent system.  My suggestion is whisky or vodka; although nausea inducing, and disorienting, with the proper moderation they allow for some relief and sleep.  We patients/customers, get treated like inmates or something.  It's degrading.  

At any rate, prior to my surgery, I first found myself discussing Egyptian archaeology with a  pre-operative nurse whom did not believe in the efficacy of Carbon-14 dating and presumably evolution.  In my experience as a patient, creationism is an extremely common position in the medical profession, but I always find it disturbing that people exerting control over my body's biochemistry disbelieve in basic biology.  I suppose on the other hand, appreciation of genetics and paleontology have relatively little bearing on the competence of those wheeling carts around, filling out forms and discarding human waste.    Nonetheless, here are a couple of links outlining our present understanding of Geologic Time, etc. for any potential nurse reading this.

In the Operating Room, they didn't talk to me very much even though I was asking questions and put in the really painful burning anesthetic into my left arm's I.V. line.  
Upon awakening, I remember a lot of pain, disorientation and vomiting.  It was extremely uncomfortable.  Usually, one awakens with pain and thirst, but here I remember them asking all kinds of questions while my head hurt and I was vomiting.  They also had in a urethral catheter, which was very uncomfortable.  I was able to get them to take it out only after begging for a long time.  One thing I hate in a hospital stay, is a urethral catheter.  I didn't need one, and resent the fact I woke up with one in.   I also woke up with an extra I.V. line in my inner elbow area.  I always request that my I.V.s be placed away from joints as they bruise the veins when I move, but obviously, this request was ignored in the O.R.  It would take them over 24 hours to remove it.  

The hospital room was nice and the nurses a bit bossy, which I guess was protocol for a neurosurgery patient.  They kept making me look around, tell the date and push my feet and hands into the air.  All I wanted to do was sleep.  At any rate it took them a long time to inject me with pain medication and remove extra I.V. input lines.  I was nauseous and could only eat Jello, which they readily supplied effectively.  

So, now I'm still sore and at home, but doing a lot better.  Seemed like an effective hospital and the associated school has a great reputation- one of the best in the world, in fact.  I've heard that the other hospitals in Pittsburgh have better food and rooms however.",3

Not really. Their spiritual counselors were omnipresent, but none seemed trained to do more than pray and give palliative counsel. The notion of ""healing"" is squarely in the allopathic/medical model as one would expect from an insurance driven hospital, and it is the only detriment of this place. Typical stuff. Over reliance and over delivery of pharmaceuticals... especially antibiotics. Arrogance and ignorance in the medical staff when questioned or advised about non allopathic treatment or remedies. They wanted to prescribe an antibiotic regimen to my 86 year old father for a minor gum infection when I suggested that it could be dealt with in a couple days with colloidal silver. She was irate at the suggestion and arrogantly admonished by father, ""Don't take that!""  Ignorance is one thing, but arrogance is indicative of deeper issues in perceiving clients as whole human beings living in a complex world with people that may have better information and experience than their corporate medical degrees can certify. For what they do, they're pretty good at it. Corporate hospitals have a long way to go to be actual places of healing. They're more like autobody shops for humans.

Unfortunately, the soda machine, was out of order, however I did notice the most unusual vending machine I have ever seen.  It was a Tombstone Pizza Vending Machine. (I have added a picture, but it also was not working)  Imagine that, they serve a pizza in a vending machine that actually cooks itself and comes out smoking hot. ( I have to imagine it, because it was not working and it did not have the prices listed)  Would be kinda cool to have one, even just for the heck of it.
(kinda star trekkish)

Approx 1:00 am my daughter was taken back into the patients room.

Dr came in, having a few test done that should have been done at CMC- Pineville

Its 2:47 am now, had a few more tests done, and appears that we are still a few hours ahead  of the ""competition"".  I feel like this should have been the first place we visited.

It is now 6am - just getting out of the hospital. overall a lot more care, attention, and service come to mind when evaluating this visit.  

The staff was very friendly, and the doctors took a lot more test to decipher the issue, instead of just prescribing medication.

If you are needing to stay at a hospital, this one is a good option.  It tends to be a bit busy (unfortunately) but had a pretty decent experience here the last week or so after my mom had to spend a couple days being monitored.

The nurses and doctors were very nice... with exception to one... let's just call her ""eccentric""  but it was okay in the end.  The room was modern and clean and there was a window seat that let someone sleep in the room while having to stay in there.

Granted I plan on not going back here in the near future, but definitely a good option for Matthews residents and the surround... not having to drive downtown for any area hospital.",4

The intake nurse was rushed but ok and the nurses I dealt with after being taken back were kind and empathetic. It's clear everyone there is overworked and rushed, which is of course, not their fault. The tech ladies were nice and sympathetic. However, I had to wait 1 hr (at 3am mind you, so I'm kinda over this at this pt, lol) for the head nurse to give the ""Ok"" on the bandage used to wrap my arm. I do understand policy and wasn't upset about that, but the nurse who came in who was apparently ""the best"" at wrapping arms, grumbled the entire time about the bureaucracy of the system and asked me what she was supposed to do to my arm. Seriously. I said, ""welp, I broke my left elbow, beyond that I'm unsure what you're supposed to do..."" She then busted out a mini cheat sheet for HOW TO WRAP and mumbled several times, ""what am I supposed to do?"" She then went on to complain about how she only had cheap equipment to work with and that it sucked. As someone who was in physical pain, this person was not helpful or reassuring, and frankly unprofessional. Aside from her, the experience was ""ok."" The place was reasonably clean.",3

It took 4 and 1/2 hours before a doctor saw her. That is ridiculous! The staff was unfriendly, not helpful & just horrible. I wouldn't come here again if my life depended on it...literally!!",1

It seems like they are always adding onto the monstrosity that is already there with another wing or deck or something.  But it's awfully nice, with a great staff and excellent response to your every question.  Unlike some other hospitals in the area (cough-Presbyterian-cough), they actually seem to care about getting you taken care of, and making sure that not only the patient but the family is attended to as well.

Don't get me wrong - I'm sure that they are collecting some monumental coin in the process, but they certainly seem to be happy while doing it.",4

I have been an overnight patient there twice, both for just one night. Both times I was admitted through the ER and, yes, the process did take a while, but it's a big city hospital, so that's what you would expect. I thought the level of attention and care was good. The people there are sympathetic and seem to care about what they are doing, and making sure that you are comfortable. There was one area where I thought they really stood out: I lost my job last year, and had trying for months to get my family into one of the local sliding scale clinics so that we could afford doctor visits and meds, only to be told that none of them were accepting new patients. The social worker at CMC took the matter into her hands, made a couple of calls, and got us in, which was a huge relief. Overall, I found that for such a big and busy hospital, the people there know and care about what they are doing.",4

There was always someone stopping by to see if I needed something, parents get breakfast for free in the room, then 2 meal tickets per day. I had the fried chicken and mac n cheese in the 1st floor cafe is OMG the best I have ever had from a hospital! The chicken parmesan sandwich from the 3rd floor cafe- YUK, good thing I didnt pay for it. The patient rooms have a small refridgerator and are pretty big, I love that the tv has movies and games on  it or you can get movies for the DVD player in the room. 
There is a ""drug"" train that goes by often tooting his horn as he travels the halls taking meds to nurse stations, he opens doors and calls the elevator too! The parents kitchen is pretty packed full of snacks and stuff that should satisfy any child. i love this place!",5

I have only been in the hospital to give birth, but I still feel a sense of vulnerability when it comes to security.  Staff members may see visitors coming and going, but I don't sense anyone is actually monitoring whether some unknown person is entering a patient's room.  That makes me a bit uneasy should I be admitted into intensive care.  This is a known issue at every hospital I have visited.  I don't know that visitor scanning is necessary but it would not hurt.  For this, I gave CMC three stars.  Note to self: send valuables home and leave them there!  Otherwise, the hospital staff are cordial when approached.  It is an accommodating facility with a cafeteria, coffee shop, gift shop, and more for patient visitors and the hospital pysician care is top rated.  Oh, parking is atrocious but is capped at $3.",3

Get ready for a mini-city within itself and having to walk a lot.  I'm sure there is a rhyme and reason for why the hospital is planned out the way it is, but it has just grown so much there are skyways and different parking decks and crazy levels.

The nice thing about the hospital is the location.... it's located off of Morehead and Kings and there are lots of things to do if you have a loved one in the hospital in terms of walking trails (to Freedom Park) or just a stones throw away from the new Midtown shops and restaurants.",4

I hate hospitals like no other, but WOW was i taken care of at the CMC. I came into the ER with my stomach feeling like I got stabbed, throwing up about every 5minutes with no end in sight. I was told I had to sign-in, which sucks to hear but I get it - handed over my ID and Healthcare card which they filled out the paper work and I signed. It was about 15minutes and 4 trips to the bathroom to throw up later that I was taken to get an IV started. 

DJ Fair was my nurse who explained what would be happening to me - AWESOME guy, kept checking up on me hours after I had been there!! Him and Kirsten got me an IV, nausa meds and some morphine - along with some heated blankets for me shivering from the chills. Went for a ct scan and a few more bags of solution and morphine I felt waaay better. Dr. Wares, Nuccio and Sprinkle took great care of me - even the gentleman that rolled me upstairs to my ct scan was very nice and kept me entertained from the pain! Once the results were in Mary explained all that was going on with my body, discussed my options and answered all my questions - she made me feel very at ease with what was happening with my body. 

Luckily I did not have to stay over night : )

Kelly M explained all of my discharge papers. She made me aware that she would be working there through the weekend so I could contact her anytime with the info that she provided. WONDERFUL lady!!

These people were GREAT!! They got me in and out quickly while keeping me completely in the loop and informed. They communicated to me clearly and continuously as to what their plan was, what was going to be happening, and the results of their findings.

I would choose this ER every time!! which as we all hope, is not anytime soon!!",5

It sure didnt surprise me, it is THE best, and I've been around------NO, not there! I meant hospitals, not just in the States, but abroad too. Top notch care and genuine concern for humanity is a common trait every employee at the CMC's carry. Its true, I never pass a face thats doesnt smile and wish me a great day.....I mean not many people do that these days, but they do! I guarantee a wonderful stay (hopefully you wont need it, but if so) and you will leave healthy and glowing.

Until 2010, I was a very healthy, active, energetic new graduate (Go 49'ers!) on my way to the start of a great career, until I suddenly became very, very ill. So ill that I was flown to California for a very specific treatment. Turned out to be a fairly complicated condition involving multiple vital organs I ended up staying until mid 2012. 3 surgeries and after recovering I moved back to Charlotte. Soon enough I had to be rushed to CMC-Pineville, because I was in an unconscious state, I dont remember how I got there or how many days Id been in the ICU? But the wonderful staff rushed as I gained conscious and explained everything, what they're doing, what the diagnosis, prognosis, treatent, meds, everything. 2 weeks in the ICU, the staff is high energy, quick and caring. 

After being switched to the 'step-down unit' or recovery floor, custodians cleaning every 30 minutes, fresh towels, gowns, socks and sheet change daily, they even have a person take our brk/lunck/dinner orders twice daily, with whatever else extras you want to request, lol.........thats if you have an appetite :) Again, friendly faces, caring nurses, aides, everyone is there to make you better and they do there best to make it happen. Unfortunately, I will always have such 'stay-cations' and extended stays at hospitals, but I cant mention it enough that the environment and people make a BIG difference when it comes to a quicker recovery.

185964,oFC5H7uXBAcsiqthj4JwaQ,8TwHEK6VPnZOM_zF1McnSA,"As a healthcare professional, I personally experienced care rendered at CMC UNIVERSITY when a family member was admitted recently.  I have the following comments.  

1- The Emergency Room was outstanding in triaging my father and coordinating his care.  EXCELLENT.  

2- For the most part, nursing care was excellent.  Most of the nursing staff (RN and CNA) were exceptional but there were deficits at times.    

3- Unfortuately, there are significant financial pressures on hospitals to increase the number of patients per nurse.  This requires family assistance at times in order to maximize patient care.  I found myself having to assist with transfers, insist upon diaper changes, demand that my family member be transferred from bed to chair, and demand that skin integrity be evaluated on a daily basis.  

4- As with any hospital, be aware that discharge planning is initiated on DAY ONE.  Medicare determines length of stay for any given diagnosis so hospitals only make money if they meet these guidelines.  All hospitals are extremely aggressive on discharging patients quickly in order to avoid a loss of revenue and CMC is no exception.   

5- Nutritional determinations are nonsensical at best.  

6- There is parking lot transportation for 'handicapped' and elderly.  However, I saw a preponderance of obese people utilizing onsite transportation in order to arrive at hospital entrances.  It seems nonsensical to post marketing flyers everywhere inside the facility about 'pre-diabetes' yet endeavor to minimize exercise.  

7- The facility was safe.  

8- Characteristic of the US healthcare, CARE IS FRAGMENTED and not coordinated despite significant time spend by nursing on entering data into portable computers.  This phenomenon will not improve with either Obamacare or EPIC (computerized medical records).    

9- PHYSICAL THERAPY WAS EXCELLENT.  

10- Much time is wasted waiting for physicians, social work, physical therapy and any other referral to arrive in the patient's room.  Wait times are literally hours without any updates as to when the patient can anticipate arrivals.  There appears to be negligible planning.   

11- The 'cafeteria' has reasonable quality breakfast and lunch but prices are high.  You are on your own for dinner.  

Bottomline:  Experience with CAROLINAS UNIVERSIY was consistent with care that you might receive in any major US hospital today.",3

The next morning she had a different nurse due to shift changes. The nurse was very rude and very inconsiderate towards my mother and her needs. My mother needed assistance to use the restroom and when I went to ask the nurse she rolled her eyes and sighed and said, ""Again? Really?"" She then went into the room to help my mom. After surgery my mom was very weak so she couldn't help herself up or speak, so she attempted to get the nurses attention by pointing to her arms. I agree that it was difficult to realize what my mom needed, but the harshness in the nurses voice when she said ""What? I can't understand what you want. You need to speak."" was very unnecessary. I don't know if it was because the nurse was tired or stressed out, but regardless of the reasoning behind her attitude, it was very inappropriate and unnecessary.  From the experience I had the first night, I could say that CMC is well staffed and has considerate nurses. But from what I experienced the next morning, my opinion has changed.",1

and when I first got on birth control SHE let ME decide while other doctors tried to decide for me which made me shy away from it. She gave me a pamphlet and told me to call her when I decided. When i picked one and I wound up not liking it they got me in the same day I called to switch over to another one!

As someone with a lot of family in the medical field and having had worked in an ER for 5 years I was evaluating my experience on many levels. 

From registration, to treatment, to being discharged less than an hour elapsed. Fantastic!

The layout of the ER confused me at first til I realized that they separate it into two sections, one for actual Emergencies/Traumas and one for lesser situations. 

The equipment was dated from what I saw on the lesser side. It definitely needs an update. 

Friendliness of the staff was hit or miss. The woman who registered/discharged me was very friendly and professional. Her two other coworkers were less than professional, often whispering to each other and joking about patients they registered. This is NOT appropriate. 

The PA (Physicians Assistant) who worked with me and treated me did a fantastic job and was very friendly. The Triage Nurse and other nursing staff seemed bored and didn't seem to want to be there. 

I also only spoke with the actual doctor for a whopping 5 seconds. 

The 4 stars is for speed and quality of care. But I debated giving them 3 for awhile due to the lack of customer service and professionalism that I observed.

Gary with a chiseled chin and blue eyes...oh, um anyway...), strapped to a board in case of spinal damage and shoved into an ambulance. Gosh, what a comfortable ride down gutted Central Avenue. It felt as though we were in a buggy galevanting down a cobblestone street. Upon arrival at the hospital I had to wait. And wait. And wait. Strapped to the board, unable to move ANYTHING, on a gurney, in a hallway. Thank God for the count the dots in the ceiling tile game I invented or surely I would have gone mad. The doctors and nurses who treated me were truly first rate. Allowing me to curse and scream as they hosed down my head and stapled my wound.

A couple weeks ago after taking my son to the ER for headaches at another hospital, we were transferred to the pediatric ICU at St Joe's when we discovered he needed surgery to remove a large tumor from his brain. It was the start of a very very long stint in the hospital full of fear, and worry, but minimized pain and lots of help and recovery.

I can't overstate how amazing the staff are at St Joe's PICU. Our neurosurgeon, Dr Nakaji was just incredible- knowledgeable, down to earth, attentive, honest but reassuring and very, very talented. His residents and all the nurses were also amazing- they were so kind and helpful. Not once did I feel that they were ""desensitized"" to our situation, and they were very compassionate while anticipating our emotional needs and physical needs (we went in there unprepared for a long stay, they brought us toiletries, snacks, laundry detergent and more). 

By all accounts, my son seems to be healthy now and I think we had the best possible circumstances of a bad situation thanks to St Joe's. I highly, highly recommend them!",5

My brother ended up needing surgery on his hand and the surgeon spent some time with my brother to talk some sense in him about the dangers of being a motorcyclist in a city where it's not safe to be one. He even offered to take my brother on his rounds so he can see the damage that can be done.

This is the only hospital I really like. I would say the comparison between this and Good Sam is night and day. By contrast, Good Sam is gross. It feels shabby, and the people are unfriendly.

I've been to the ER at St. Joseph's twice. The first time was for a motorcycle accident. I was fine after the wreck but my shoulder kind of fell out of it's socket so I had to go. I was being seen by a doctor within 20 minutes of walking in on my own strength. The doctor was very nice and the nursing staff was great. Everyone joked with me and made me feel really comfortable. Riding a stretcher in a neck brace and wanting to look around on the way is impossible, BTW, just incase you want to try it cant be done.

My second visit was for a more severe thing. I had food poisoning from YC's Mongolian BBQ (read my review on that place) and shit/threw up so much that I became severely dehydrated. I couldn't walk on my own and while at Urgent Care they couldn't get an IV in me due in part to their own retardation. Well again, I was called back almost immediately at St. Joe's. They told me their ER is new and is designed to handle MANY more patients than the other hospitals and it shows. I got a total hottie doctor there! She wasn't interested in a guy who was in my state though... I was gross that day. The entire staff is made up of young, attractive, go getters. Not like Good Sam which is old, fat people who work in a gross hospital.

I actually consider myself myself fortunate to have some place to go that seems able to handle unusual situations from what can occur with a an 89 year old lady with Alzheimers to what happens when you fall of a ""small"" cliff and land on your wrist to most recently what happens when you lacerate the bottom of your foot and toes when you step on the glass of a broken candle.  I won't tell you I have always been happy with the amount of time I have had to wait some times.  I haven't always been thrilled with the staff.

They tried to play God. Please note this happened over 10 years ago but the Internet didn't have a rating system like this, so I'm just getting around to this. My son was admitted with seizures and aspiration pneumonia at the St Joe's ER (via ambulance) at one month of age. This was after a month long battle with pediatricians who didn't believe my wife and I when we told them that we thought our son was having seizures at home. Once St Joe's ER team stabilized our son (with Valium), bizarre things started happening in this hospital. We were immediately accused of child abuse. They thought that we had injured our son on the head to cause these seizures. Immediately on the defensive, my wife and I felt compelled to sleep in our son's PICU room on the floor and not leave for the duration - that turned out to be three months. We took shifts to use the restroom or eat at the cafeteria. Nurses made one critical mistake after another. The hospital staff grew suspicious of us staying 24/7 and the hospital manager along with seven others took us into a meeting room to chastise my wife and I for staying 24/7. Long story short, an outside endocrinologist learned that my son had low calcium and that was the cause of the seizures. But even so, things kept getting worse and they kept my son for an extended period. He contracted yeast pneumonia because a nurse didn't wash her hands... the little girl in the room next door who initially had the yeast pneumonia wound up dying three days later. My son had to be given Amphotericin B because of this (the drug is often lethal!). Then my son developed enterocolitis and wasn't expected to live through the night. This was the second crisis that did not relate to any condition that our son was admitted for initially. On three separate occasions their pediatric doctors told me ""your son isn't going to make it through the night"" and each time, I called an outside surgeon to come in and save him. Praise God he is alive and healthy today, in NO thanks to this hospital, as he nearly didn't make it at St. Joes. Even the outside surgeons asked me ""WHY did you bring your son to St Joe?"" (the reason was that the ambulance brought us there!). Before we were discharged (my son was 4 months old at this time), an outside endocrinologist revealed that he had a serious genetic syndrome. The St. Joe doctors could not figure this out on their own in the three months we were admitted. At the time my wife and I did not think about suing for malpractice... we were just happy that our son was alive. Shame on this PICU and shame on the doctors. But again, this was 10 years ago. Hopefully those doctors are gone. I know one doctor was still there when I met him in the hallway there a few years ago. He remembered my son and I, but all he could do was stand there for a second, briefly glance at my son, then look at the ground and walk off. Despicable. This is only half the story",1

215979,71ipKrAHy9bpHmLSFKpfjA,6vYamTrBku9xURhqxKyw0g,"I was on day 2 of what appeared to be a severe stomach something, I had no control of my bowels, couldn't sleep, couldn't eat, and couldn't be away from the toilet for more  than 5 mins. 

I went to the ER, it was early afternoon on a weekday, the waiting room was empty.  I was evaluated right away and very impressed.  It was so clean and smelled so nice!  

After the evaluation, my impression slowly slid downhill.  The person giving me my IV appeared to be in training and didn't have a clue what they were doing.  After being poked and prodded several times with no success, someone else took over, at this point I was crying, and the IV was placed first try. Blood was then taken, I had to ask what it was for, and was told the doctor wants to see my blood work before going for a Cat Scan to check my liver as the dye they inject through the IV could cause serious damage to my liver if the blood tests revealed my liver couldn't handle the injectible dye. The nurse gave me a liquid and told me to drink it without explaining what it was. After asking, I was told that this was for the Scan in addition to the injectable dye and would work on it's own if the blood tests revealed they couldn't give me the injectible. The nurse also told me that exactly 45 minutes after I finish drinking this, I would have the CT Scan. I was then moved to another room and placed in a reclining chair.  After 15 minutes I had seen no one, was freezing and asked a cleaning person for blankets.  After another 15 minutes I needed to run to the bathroom, the door marked ""for patient use only"" was locked.  I was in a panic, ran to the other side of the hall and found a nurses station where the nurses appeared to be joking and flirting with each other totally oblivious to the fact that they had patients.  

The nurse went with me to the bathroom and knocked on the door, the door opened and out walked a staff member appearing to have freshened up her makeup.  The nurse was in my room when I came back.  I asked him how to work the chair, how to work the TV and how to call for help if needed. I asked for a pillow.  It was then that the nurse asked me when I finished the drink.  I told him that it had been over 30 to 35 minutes.  (Remember I had to have the test within 45 minutes.)  

The nurse left and next an orderly came and said they were taking me for a CT Scan.  I didn't know the results of my blood work, I didn't know what was going to happen, I had never had a CT Scan before but if the injectible stuff could cause damage to my liver, I was sooooooo scared.  

I was left in the hallway of Radiology with not a staff member in sight, people walking by once in a while, walking around me, not saying a word.  The CT technician opened a door checked my band, asked my name and wheeled me in the room.  He asked me to lay on this area, hardly saying anything started hooking me up to stuff.  I was so scared and said, ""no one is talking to me, I have never had this before, what is going to happen?  Do you have the results of my tests?""   He shared a little told me when the dye was injected I would feel warm and possibly taste metal, I really thought I was going to die.  I was so scared.  In my nervousness I kept telling him no one is talking to me and he spoke a little more.  I don't remember who but someone wheeled me back to my room.  Again I sat for a while and finally pushed the nurse button.  A nurse came to me and told me they were waiting for my test results, asked my pain level and then gave me morphine.  

After a while, the doctor appeared, this is now the 2nd and final time I saw the doctor.  The Doctor basically told me they didn't find anything, they weren't sure what was wrong with me but  I was being given prescriptions for what they think it is a reaction to an antibiotic i was on for a sinus infection, bactrim.   After this brief less than 5 minute encounter, the doctor left saying someone would come with my discharge papers. This entire time I never even got out of my street clothes and I was there for hours, the doctor didn't check me over, no one did.  

I was handed my discharge papers with three prescriptions.   I was given nothing to stop the explosive uncontrollable illness coming out of my bottom.  

After another day my regular doctor prescribed me meds to stop my uncontrollable explosions.  The meds slowed them but on the 2nd day on this med, taking the max dose and still very sick,  I went to an Urgent care and was finally given tests for possible food poisoning, received a complete exam, got all my questions answered and next steps.  I wasn't scared anymore.  Within a few hours I started feeling better and within a week I will know exactly what I had thanks to Urgent Care.   It has now been a week and I haven't heard a word from the hospital.

Next time Urgent care first!!!  I will not go back here unless I have no other choice.

Not only better care and concern but a lot less $$$$!!!!",1

215981,0AQR6_0SUQRlt-uNzazquw,6vYamTrBku9xURhqxKyw0g,"If it wasn't for a couple of the nurses (D*** in the ER and Linda on the floor)  who were exceptional, I would say this is the absolute worst hospital I have ever experienced.  I'm glad I don't live in town and run the risk of ever having to go there again.

SECURITY:
First and foremost, their security is beyond a joke.  I'm in town for a business conference/meeting when I am experiencing the familiar symptoms, tthat I know are life threatening.  As I walk into the ER, I am looking directly at the Triage nurses, who are waiting for me to come up to the window.  About 10 feet before I reach them, a security guard literally yells at me, asking me what I wanted.  I just looked at him and asked him if he was really seriious?   In a tone, I made it clear, he would be calling a lot of back up if he didn't stfu.   His response was..""ohh ok if you want to be seen, wait behind the black line for the nurses to call you"".  These are the nurses, who are obviously waiting for me to come up to their window and talk to them.  (There was one other person in the entire waiting room!!)  So after explaining the situation to the nurses, they call an emergency code to come get me.  

While in the ""serious"" section of the ER, where they put their major trauma, heart attack, stroke etc. patients. I see a German Shepard with his handler walk through.  I'm thinking it was a police officer who was their with a prisoner and didn't want to leave the dog in the car as the heat could be very dangerous.  But I find out that this is the security's dog patrolling to keep things in check.  Very weird to see this.  But to bring the dog into the section where people are on the verge of dying it completely friggin insulting.

So when I am making small talk with the staff, it becomes clear that EVERYONE has had a run in with security. One of many stories I heard, was how a nurse in her scrubs, with her photo ID hanging around her neck was stopped and questioned as to what she was doing in the hospital.

DOCTOR'S
The ER doc was compentent. Though he really seemed to be botherd, because I had questions. I already knew the diagnosis (I made it before I came in), but when he told me of the CT scan results, it implied that I was going to lose my leg.  So I of couse I had questions.  One was were the radiologists good enough to understand what they were seeing?
He assured me they were very good.  The  radiologist was ultimately determined to be a dumbass.  But because of his incorrect reading of the 4 CT scans, I was just about to get out of there and drive the several hours home.  Which, really could have killed me.  D**** (for her protection), one awesome nurse, convinced me to stay because she didn't think what the doctor's were telling me, was correct and she told me WHY she felt that way.  And she was absolutlely right.  So the admitting physician/hospitalist put me on a no food or drink order as he expected me to have a surgical procedure, done first thing in the morning, to try to correct the misdiagnosed CT scans.

The next day, about 11am he rounds and I ask him about why the surgical procedure that hasn't happened yet.  And he tells me that the surgeon is reviewing my case and still hasn't decided if I was a candidate for the procedure. So around 2pm the surgeon/specialist rounds and sees me.  I ask him what is going on with the procedure.  He informs me that he made it very clear that morning to the hospitalist, that I wasn't a candidate.  So I waited 20 hours without even water and the hospitalist knew it, and made me wait even longer.  Not cool at all.  

Now the surgeon/specialist was very good.  He brought up some ideas and thoughts that I could share with my specialists back home.

So it was clear that I had all the meds I needed and could go home that day, but we had to get the orders from the hospitalist.  Problem was, is that my sister would have to fly out to get me and drive me home. So she needed to make sure they would release me.  Repeated messages and pages to the hospitalist go unreturned.  This is becoming a major logistical problem.  So my nurse Linda (probably one of the best nurses I ever had) tells me to tell my sister to get on the plane becuase she will make my discharge happen.  She does, and I finally get the hell out of there.

NURSES:  Other than a nurse who doesn't understand HIPPA regulations. They were all very good and the only redeeming factor for this hospital.  D*** kept me there and potentially saved my life.  Then AFTER she was off her shift she went out of her way to go to my car and get my bags which had several things I needed if I was going to stay. Now,  Linda was like a mom.  She took care of me, bitched to me about some of the things I shouldn't be doing, forced the doctor's to do their job and made the whole experience so much better.

WhenIgot here I was seen by the physician pretty quick she ordered tests to be done and I let here know I maybe pregnant but a less than 10 days but they still decided not to take a blood test and me being in the healthcare industry I know a urine test wouldnt show anything yet so that was the first red flag
What if they would of given me something that isnt safe for pregnancy?? Obvious they dont care. And that will be the only and one time I saw the doctor in the entire stay. They move me to a shared space with reclining chairs and the person next to me got moved and the nurse that was moved her was the one taking care of my room or space whatever you call it(g502) and she did not even clean the chair before the next person showed up! What happen to UNIVERSAL PRECAUTIONS to protect people from getting diseases theyre not suppose to get???Im pretty sure they didnt clean mines before I sat there which makes me feel disgusted.Ok I sat there for 1 hr I called for a tylenol because my pain was killing me and 1/2 hr later my nurse came to take my vitals and she tried to discharge at the same give me my test results I told her her I asked for a tylenol earlier and my pain has worsen and I asked for a script for tylenol and she got mad(her name is Rosy G) she told me in a very rude way ""well then I have to do all this over again"" (my discharge paper) and she asked me why didnt I ask for this earlier I told her she never came and seen me. I HAD TO ASK A DIFFERENT NURSE FOR TYLENOL THAT I NEVER GOT AND YOU WERE STANDING THERE RIGHT BEHIND HER YOU COULD OF CAME AND SEE WHAT I NEEDED. Anyways continuing on she came back and give me the discharge paper and kicked me out know I was still in pain and since I never got the tylenol I had to sit outside for 45mins in horrible pain waiting for my ride.

The doctors and physicians assistants are quick as possible and get me the right medicines. I've rarely spent more than 2 hours here, and only had a handful of bad incidences (involving nurses who don't listen to me: ""if you give me that medicine without an antinausea, I will vomit""). I like the quick rooms (for non trauma) which are quieter and have adjustable lighting that helps during my migraine treatment  much better than the rooms with the uncomfortable gurneys. They have these rolling recliners, it feels less hospitaly, which is probably why its less stressful. 

They also limit to one visitor per bedside (which is mostly adhered to), so no running around kids and screaming babies. 

The only reasons it doesn't get five stars are the times when I've had rude nurses who act like they're doing some kind of charity when they're doing their job, and the ones who decide they know my body better than I do (four years of daily migraines, but hey, if they want to wear vomit, its their choice). I also had to visit family in the regular part of the hospital once (I've never been admitted to any part other than ER), and the waiting room was packed. Children everywhere, people sitting on floors, it was awful. There was that gross smell from just too many people in one tiny waiting room because of visiting hours being so restricted. Actually, that part reminded me of a bus station.

At the ER, I would usually expect to be treated with some modicum of compassion and 'dignity' as the name of the parent company implies. Nurse Kelly began her brand of compassion by digging around in my arm to insert an IV catheter. I begged her no less than 6 times to stop, please try the other arm. I was in extreme pain.
Nurse Rachet responded by digging further in scolding me it was a large catheter. After she could mangle my arm no further, she tried my other arm and got it right in.

After waiting in the room for an MRI for 4 hours, I was starving. I asked for something to eat and was told I could not eat before the MRI, which I understand. Nurse Kelly then began a lecturing tirade at me in the middle of the ER that I 'needed to understand that when I come to the ER that I should expect to be there all day, including at least three hours after the test to wait for results. She further went on to suggest that I was being selfish and not considerate of other patients whose needs may be greater than mine. I was SIMPLY asking only if she might know when I may be taken in for the test. Her accusations were a needless and reactionary assault on my character. I would never want to push my way in front of a patient who has more pressing needs!
I
At that point, I told her I needed another nurse. I refuse to be treated as a child by a condescending, incompetent nurse whose calling is supposedly to be a compassionate care giver. I do not go to the ER everyday and I was afraid enough for my health already, which is clearly WHY I was there in the first place. She then continued her condescending lecture on how she has tons of other patients; blah blah blah and said she would speak to her supervisor about getting me another nurse.

Mollified again, I said I wanted to check out. Whatever was wrong with me was no longer worth tolerating this treatment I am PAYING for. I will be following up elswhere hopefully at a healthcare center that does not employ 'caregivers' of such ineptitude that treat you like trash. For the record, I have insurance and am not indigent, not that that should matter. Having entered the world at St. Joe's 40 years ago, it was particularly disheartening.

Once I woke up I was in ICU/recovery. My nurse there was AMAZING as well. Everything changed once I got to my room for the night. My nurse Smitha was absolutely horrible. She had no bedside manor and was very rough with me. At one point she did a ultra sound on my bladder (I had surgery on my abdomen) and she was pushing very hard right under my incisions. I told her she was being too rough and she said she needed to do this. She could've easily gone down a little lower to check my bladder, directly under my incisions was not necessary. At one point she asked what my pain level was and I told her a 7. She smirked and walked away. She also told me I could just lay in bed and do nothing all night. I have had this surgery 2 other times and know to avoid pain in the shoulders it is best to get up and walk around. So my boyfriend helped me do this. I really just think she didn't want to do her job. Plenty of other people are looking for jobs, so why do nurses like her work for such a well known facility?

My Orthopedic is affiliated with this hospital, and I developed a problem with my shoulder.  Since I'd just seen my Orthopedic about my knees and hips, he wasn't readily available for another visit so soon.  Thus I chose, what I thought would be the next best thing;  the hospital he was affiliated with, thinking that all results would be readily available for my Orthopedic upon my next office visit and he'd be better able to make a diagnosis/treatment plant.

First off let me say that this hospital and its parking lot is very small. it took me a minute to locate the Emergency Unit.  Once there, I had to play ""musical windows"" with the ER personnel processing paperwork.  The waiting area was very small and dark.  What began getting on my nerves, along with the shoulder pain, were the ER Admissions team making jokes with each other, and seemingly processing endless amounts of paperwork for ghost people.  

When my name was finally called, I was told that my Orthopedic's On Call Physician wouldn't be able to see me.  Instead, I saw a Physician's Aid, who put me in an arm sling, wrote out prescriptions and sent me on my way???

Later that month, I was admitted for Outpatient Surgery.  Long story short:  1) A Security Guard escorted me to an empty, dark lobby where I waited for the Outpatient Team to arrive.  Upon Admission (and I discovered days later after the surgery), I discovered that I'd been given another patient's paperwork.  2) Two nurses were unable to find a vein for the I.V. (after 10 sticks. Mind you I couldn't eat or drink before surgery) and the third nurse (who used an Ultrasound machine) dug that needle in so hard that I have a long streaked black and blue mark.  Overall, you can count all 10 sticks between both arms.  3) Why did the nurse ask me what I was allergic or had intolerance to, only for my Doctor to write me a prescription for the very drug that I'm intolerant to? Obviously there was a miscommunication  between my Doctor and his assisting nurses?

After getting home from a job interview, I promptly slipped on a stair and broke my foot. The bone was sticking out, not through the skin, but definitely poking out. Immediate thought - I should go to the hospital, but my copay is way too expensive for my student budget, so my roommate drove me over to Advanced Urgent Care.
The wait wasn't long, but I wasn't happy when the woman at the desk saw me limping in, and had me stand there and fill out paperwork for ten minutes. A nurse in a wheelchair came out and wheeled me in to get it over with.
After sitting for awhile and answering the usual questions, I was wheeled in to a room to wait for an X-Ray. I took out my phone to call mum to let her know where I was, and the woman at the desk immediately began snapping at me that there were no cell phones allowed in the room. Okay then.
Then, nurses began flocking in to gawk at my foot. I'm not a freaking animal in a zoo, do not come in and stare in awe at the size my foot has swollen to and make me feel more like an imbecile for breaking it. 
After being stared at, I was wheeled in for Xrays and then taken to a room to wait for the doctor.
She came in pretty quickly and immediately began poking my foot with the ""Does this hurt?!"" questions. Of course it hurts! Stop yanking on it repeatedly. After looking at Xrays and my foot, she informed she was unconfident in saying my foot was broken.
Day later, a call back from the radiologist who wants to know if it's my hand or my foot, whether it's my left or my right, just left me feeling shocked and slightly concerned that they were unable to tell that in an Xray...
Going to the doctor the next day when she's open, it's broken in two places, which she pointed out clearly on the Xray I had picked up from Urgent Care.

We found Advanced Urgent Care through the web and elected to go to one (they have 8 in the Phoenix area) closest to our hotel.  We even called ahead for an appointment and showed up on time.  I guess it's good we had the appointment - that kept the waiting time down to only about two hours (!!).  My wife was then seen by a physician's assistant who actually had a specialty in ear, nose and throat, and seemed to know what she was doing in diagnosing the problem, giving advice and providing a prescription that we could be filled nearby.  The ear infection eased up after treatment, so I'd say the treatment was OK.

On the other hand, there are some troubling things about this place, beyond the long wait even with an appointment.  Like the first thing you see walking in the door - a junk food vending machine selling chips, candy and the like.  Almost right next to the registration desk.  Now maybe Arizona is not as enthusiastic about healthy eating and preventive care as some parts of California - I can accept that because we Californians can be a bit obsessive at times.  But for a doctor's office to be pushing junk food as soon as the patient enters the building (and I'm sure the corporate owner of Advanced Urgent Care gets a cut of the vending machine sales) is just barely better than having a cigarette vending machine in the corner.  It's putting profits before public health and that's never a good thing.

The other thing I found troubling was the TV in the waiting room - set for a religious channel - not exactly welcoming to people with different religious beliefs.  Surely they could be playing videos on healthy eating or something like that.  But then, I suppose, they'd have to remove the junk food vending machine for lack of use, and that would be bad for the bottom line.

So, to conclude, the treatment for my wife's fairly straightforward problem was competent, but I'm not sure this chain of urgent care centers really has taken a mission of public health to heart.",2
218477,nSyuLAD0lgU-vwCHXoirRQ,xtGPxmqw37SZylUPcJ1MHQ,"I was shocked to find this place had so many bad reviews. I only stumbled upon the bad reviews when I was checking this place for its office hours. I have been to this place many times, and find it is well run. 

 I do think that in general it is usually those who have a bad experience who take the time to leave a review. That tends to be universally true. Think about it. How often do we call up a credit card company and thank them for getting our bill accurate? We only call when their is a problems. 

  My Large Family has used this place for stitches, x rays, ingrown toe removal (ugh I know), and your basic ""my child is sick and the DR isnt open"". I have found that the waiting time is minimal. The Drs and staff are friendly and professional, and I can get in and get out much faster than other places I have used. The only problem I see with telling others how satisfied I am is that the waiting room might be more crowded, but I guess I can live with that.   

In all the years I have used this place, and yes, I do have other options, I have found the Doctor or PA to be competent.   I have no problem seeing a Nurse Practitioner or other medical provider. 

My last visit was for an earache.   The discharging staff actually read out loud all the discharge rules. I think that is a valuable practice, as most of dont read that paper.   They have bilingual staff too, so that helps.   I felt I was seen quickly and discharge quickly.  

I never noticed thin walls, as I could not hear noise from others, and the TV was on NICKELODEON,   which was channel my teenage daughter was happy with. I am sure you can change the channel if the TV is not your liking.  There were TVS in each exam room.",5
218478,t2JfS7ZFCyfHfwbSWkr_zQ,xtGPxmqw37SZylUPcJ1MHQ,"Yeah fine I guess. The best thing about it was we got right in and someone helped us almost right away. We were there at like 8 a.m. on a Wednesday in a September. I guess it's a matter of what time of the day/week you're there. It wasn't outrageously expensive and they didn't nickel and dime me. The biggest issue for us was getting a cab out of there. What a freaking nightmare. Listen, if you're going to use taxis in Phoenix, my best advice is to make friends with the cab driver who picks you up at the airport and get his card and make him your driver the whole time you're there. Tip him like crazy, they need 10,000 more cabs than they have right now in Phoenix. We met this guy and he was awesome, calked him for every trip we took after meeting him. Cabs are a huge hassle in Phoenix.",3
218479,6JCC7po_g5luxaKqp9W5Xw,xtGPxmqw37SZylUPcJ1MHQ,This place is the total opposite of urgent care.  I was here for 2 hours before I saw a physician.  1 hour in the waiting room and another in the private room.  The staff are not very friendly and the first thing they do besides collect your health insurance is get your money.  I guess they're afraid you're going to leave halfway through waiting and not pay them.  I would not recommend this place to any suffering soul who needs to see a doctor immediately.,1
218640,Zdhv6xYileJLyYvUj-LRcw,FJDiaJSXQip-sgXxYe1vDg,"What is as good as it gets when it comes to permanent care for a loved one with Alzheimer's?  I'm not sure but Huger Mercy Living Center, part of the St Joseph's Hospital chain, has to come close to it.  

The goal of Huger Mercy is to allow the residents to remain as active and independent as possible and to maintain their dignity while living with this disease. They also provide exceptional medical services.  When it came time for me to admit I could no longer care for my 90 year old friend at home, this was essential for me.  I don't know what my expectations are for the future, but I have less fear for her care than I ever thought I would.  I especially appreciate one thing.  Family is encouraged to come visit any time 24 hours a day.  I've never been disappointed in what I have found and believe me, I have shown up at some odd hours.

No one wants to ever have to deal with this.  Most people don't even want to think about it.  If the time ever comes that you do,  I recommend you check out this facility.  From the setting of five acres of trees and grass and flowers to the residents to the staff, to the families you meet when you visit, It gives a feeling of home.  If this is where someone will be spending the last years of their lives with an awful disease like Alzheimer's, what more can one ask.

I want to end this on a happy note,  Huger mercy has four cottages for 12 residents each.  As the resident's mental state deteriorates, they are moved to another cottage.  Each residence is exactly the same to prevent as much confusion in transition as possible.  My friend was going to go into the first residence of the highest functioning resident's.  I had been there some months earlier to take a look, but wanted to see it again when it came time to place Norma there.  We went over there and it was locked with nobody there.  It was an outing day, they'd all gone out for lunch that day.  I know the restaurant they went to and like it myself!  Next week I understand it's out to Scottsdale to a place I've never been.   I may ask them if I can go along!",5
218641,loBr9tTVzwM4LHLhzCYyhw,FJDiaJSXQip-sgXxYe1vDg,"Sadly I tell you that I moved my friend away from Huger.  It is really a matter of what works for the individual and this wasn't the correct place for Norma.  They don't provide some of the amenities which are essential for her such as having a private bathroom for each room;  also, a nicer dining area and great room.  I also think they just didn't have enough outside activities for her.

Huger was not the right place for my friend.  Doesn't mean its bad just health care in any case is such an individual thing.   It is no different for dementia care.",4

* Well trained, competent, caregivers who receive ongoing professional training
* Caregivers had extra patience and skills with residents when challenging situations arose
* Staff who supported residents' faith, beliefs, and values
* The care provided was based on the latest research about Alzheimer's disease and dementia; for example, music  as part of the activities and appropriate colors in the cottages
* The meals and snacks were nutritious, varied and delicious
* Variety of activities and outings to entertain the residents; themed parties, refreshments after Chapel services
* Communication with families was consistently excellent
* Families and friends can visit ANYTIME and expect consistent high-quality care
* Speakers with expertise on topics that were relevant and of interest to families were provided

221480,XCdNz5k6G5SWl0I3KV3F0Q,JOWKc4zjacAnINGmKNhlPA,"I took my youngest son here at 6AM a few days ago. He had been running a fever all night and would not stop crying. We got there and the tech at the front desk was checking in another child, but still took his time to look at me and ask me to fill in the sign-in sheet. He didn't take longer than 5 minutes on the other patient, took them back to a room and then came back out and it was our turn.
He was very calm and tried to make my son laugh, even though he wasn't having any of it, but was very professional at the same time. He ran through his part of checking my son in. This hospital even provided diapers and wipes for the kids. I have never had a hospital do that for my son's. 
He took us back to our room and immediately a nurse came in. I wish I could have remembered all of these wonderful people's names, but it was so early in the morning and not having slept that night, my brain was not really working. 
All the nurses that came in to do what they needed to do in order to figure out what was wrong with my baby, were so kind, funny, caring, and gentle with him. The only time he cried was when they put a catheter in him, but i am sure it was because it was painful & not because of the nurses.

WRONG!!!! but....you don't know this until after your child is seen and they tell you the copay for an ER visit. they quote emtala as the reason for not telling you cost of services/co pay upon entry, even tho its clear your child is NOT suffering from an emergency situation. oh! and the receipt and paperwork you receive also does not reference an emergency facility....but it is. has been for 10 years, but if one's not been here before, how would one know?

The Dr came in and said he would need stitches so they numbed him up and within 20 minutes he was getting his stitches. The Dr even brought in an assistant to hold my son down while getting his stitches so that my husband or myself didn't have to be the bad guy. After the stitches were done and he was all cleaned up, he got to pick out  prize from the treasure chest. The nurses and Dr were wonderful. We had a great experience at Mendy's Place.

Then, the following Saturday, I had to take ANOTHER friend to this Hospital. Also five stars. 

On a Saturday night, my friend and I had very little wait. She was given a bed almost immediately and saw a doctor within minutes. Even though I am not family, I was allowed to accompany her with her consent. This is really refreshing as I have run into draconian family-only policies before, which basically adds more stress to an already stressful process. 

The doctor was very thorough and took into account my friend's cost concerns regarding testing and her prescriptions. Thankfully, my friend's condition was not terribly serious and we were in an out in a matter of hours! The staff was very friendly and accommodating and made sure that both of us got instructions for follow up and did not have any questions. When we did have questions later, at a separate pharmacy, our calls were promptly answered and our concerns addressed quickly. 

Husband was left in the waiting room, and he reported that he also had a good experience.

I won't bore you with the many complaints I had during my stay, but if you can avoid being submitted to this hospital, do whatever you can. Going back when I was being taken to the ER, I would have taken a longer trip if that meant I could have stayed at a better hospital. So just ONE of the BAJILLION complaints I have about this hospital is...

They are under staffed and the nurses are witches. After my surgery I had to pee (sorry if that's TMI) but I couldn't get to the bathroom on my own so I paged a nurse. NO ONE came around for an HOUR. Towards the end of that hour I was paging the nurses every two seconds. Still nada. 

Finally, I grabbed my cell phone, called 411 and had them connect me with the hospital, I spoke with a receptionist and had to ask her if someone would please come to my room to help me. It was after that a nurse actually came to help me. Can you believe that??

There are a lot of elderly people in this part of town too and they probably would have just been left there to crap all over themselves or been ignored. If you have a grandparent or know an older person staying here, get them transferred.

other issues in the eyes of someone on pain meds:
-they didn't toast my bagel and it made me cry. through tears i said to my sister, 'they didn't toast my bagel!!!' and then i'm pretty sure i through it on the floor. but that parts a bit blurry. 
- they didn't knock before barging into my room in the middle of the night, which scared me and made me cry. through tears i said, 'can you please knock??!!'

issues not related to pain meds:
- you have to share a room. yuck. my roommate was a farter.
- the nurses are evil. they don't pay attention to the needles and tubes INSIDE of your SKIN when they go to take your blood pressure!! imagine having those ripped out of your arm bc the nurse isn't paying attention
-in order to leave they make the head dr or nurse or something check you out. we waited 6 hours waiting for the nurse person while the nurses kept telling us to hold on, it should be soon. and then we found out it wasn't necessary and they finally let us leave. 
- the nurses argue. see conversation below:
""samantha- are you in pain? do you need more pain meds?'
'yes'
'you must not be in pain if you're sleeping'
'i'm not asleep'
'your eyes are closed'
'ummm, i'm responding aren't i? i'm not asleep'
'well if you were in pain it would be impossible for you to lay here calmly'
'can you please stop arguing with me? i am in pain so please stop arguing with me'",1

Every department is first class. The best doctors in the world practice here and if any trip to a hospital can be called pleasant, then this is the one that fits that description. 

I also have to add a special comment about what is called ""the cafeteria"". This is the best use of understatement ever. If this is a ""cafeteria"" then a Rolls Royce is just a ""car"". Food is served 24/7 on a combination cook to order, hot prep and self serve basis which rivals anything at the best Scottsdale resorts and at fast food prices. This hidden gem is open to the public but is primarily there to serve staff and visitors. I admit to having lunch there when I am in the area because it is just so good. Imagine broiled sea bass with salsa verde and a spinach salad with cherry vinaigrette dressing and coffee for $6.74. The food is good, healthy, fresh and the dining area is pleasant even when crowded. The same great food is served to patients as permitted by their doctors. There is no wine list but that is the only thing that keeps this restaurant from taking on the finest upscale places in town.

I was in the area, so I decided to pop in. Although this wasn't a life or death situation, I was coughing pretty heavily and needed care quick. The ER folks took good care of me. 

In and out of the ER in 50 minutes. Not bad eh? It was a slow night. But then again...it's Scottsdale. Nothing exciting happens when the hospital is usually filled with old people.  I was given a nebulizer treatment and given a pat on the butt. Off I went. No big deal.

236695,4SqIcRLE9WesCgU4irMUUQ,Aq6lSh0dfAYMsLoJf17BJQ,"LOVE LOVE LOVEE The Family Birthing Suites at Scottsdale Osborn.  I checked in at 3 pm on June 10th - separate building from hospital.  After talking with the DR on call, we decided that the best course of action, for me and my son, was for me to have a c-section.  

Baby C was born at 6:01pm.  8lb 10oz, 21inches long, Healthy, and Screaming!  LOL
This birthing center is nice and private.  At most, there's 12 mamas on the floor.  Makes for lots of personal attention and you don't feel like just another number.  

I will say that 95% of the staff was wonderful.  The 5% being the night shift staff I had my 2nd night.  TERRIBLE!  The Aid was pretty much nonexistent.  And well the RN on her first hour on shift, she's trying to ""Help"" my son nurse.  She's not only man-handling my boobs, but shoving my sons face into my tit.  Baby C is screaming and I'm getting frustrated.  Then the nurse starts in with her agenda - her formula pushing agenda.  My husband was ready to cave, but I told her to give us (my son and I) 5 minutes.  She left the room.  I was able to get Baby C calmed down and latched on.  Without shoving my boob into his face/mouth.  But that didn't stop her belittling my efforts.  All night long, I was beaten down with her formula pushing as Baby C was waking up every 2 or so hours to nurse.   I ignored her every time and said each time, ""well his pediatrician (who had saw Baby C and I that first day) said that my body knows what to do, and I'm producing colostrum...which is all he needs right now.  My milk will come in in a few days.  And that I need to nurse to get my milk to come in.""  This horrid nurse would always say, ""he's hungry..that's why he's crying.  You should really give him formula.""   

Nurse Ratchet came in at 6am making her final rounds, and again I was nursing Baby C.  She finally says to me, ""Well you're getting a lot of practice.""  I seriously wanted to bitch slap this C You Next Tuesday.  After having little to no sleep, I lost it and started weeping.  She asked if I was alright and I said YUP.  She knew I had hit my breaking point and left.  I then began to sob uncontrollably.  I called my mom, who could bairly understand me over the sobs.  I called J, who also couldn't understand me.  But both made it a point to hurry up and get down to the Birthing Center.  Thankfully, the wonderful team I had my first day was back on shift.  The Aid came and said, as she walked in the door, ""How's my superstar (I according to them had been an ideal patient...moving around the room, tending to baby, and walking the hall every few hours with Baby C...letting him get some sun from the skylights in the halls.  Apparently they have to practically drag other new moms out of bed.) this morning?!""  Then when she saw the emotional state I was in, ""OMG are you alright?  What's wrong!?""  I cried on her shoulder for a good 20 minutes.  She reassured me and she said she would notify the nursing supervisor of what happened.  Baby C's pediatrician was making rounds and stopped by while the Aid was getting my vitals.  I addressed what happened over night, and said that if that nurse and aid was going to be back on shift, that I wanted to get Baby C and I discharged (if all my dr's approved).  Dr G. was outraged at what happened!!  She's pro-breastfeeding.  So Dr. G went and paid a visit to the nursing supervisor.  I was happy to hear that Nurse Ratchet and her sidekick was going to be returning that evening.  

My RN that day was Ruth.  OMG.  RUTH = AWESOME  She's been an RN for at least 50 years and her bedside manner proved it.  She's wonderful.  She knew I had a rough night and wanted Baby C and I to get a nice nap.  So she let me nurse C and came in a few minutes after we finished up, with a bottle of lotion.  Baby C was already asleep.  I'm tellin you, I got the best backrub of my life that morning.  And J said I was out like a light within minutes.  
 
So there you have it.  From one end of the spectrum to the other.  Ruth vs. Nurse Ratchet.  

The facility = 5 stars
The staff = depends on who you get.  
Nurse Ratchet and her sidekick Aid = Negative Stars
The rest of the staff = 5+ Stars!

I'm going to go ahead and give 5 stars.",5

but in reality seem to have the youngest and least experienced people probably  due to there lower pay and benefits. I guess that's why they all look like teenagers there.
Many doctors and the experienced nursing and support staff have left in droves.I was warned about them when a close family friend was being treated at Mayo and then later when a emergency developed  was taken to this place (Scottsdale Healthcare) Mayo Clinic called them and ordered a necklace that said in case of emergency DO NOT TAKE TO SCOTTSDALE  HEALTHCARE. It is clear why this hospital chain above all others concerned the doctors at the Mayo Clinic. Like many Arizonians we have also heard about many supposedly unnecessary deaths from this excuse for a hospital.",1
236697,ownEuPTg802mwmC1oMQjDQ,Aq6lSh0dfAYMsLoJf17BJQ,"So, my friend had a horrible accident at work and put his hand through a saw.  He severed three fingers, and was rushed here for surgery.  The surgeon was able to re-attach his fingers, and he was in ICU for 2 days, and was eventually moved to the recovery area for 3 days, spending a total of 5 days here in this hospital.

While visiting him, I was happy to see that they were taking good care of him.  The ICU here was 1 nurse for every 2 patients, and he had his own room.  They checked on him every hour, making sure his hand was still gaining circulation through his fingers.

The nurses in ICU were really good, and took excellent care of him.  Once he was moved upstairs to the 4th floor, he shared a room with another guy who was pretty cool.  The nurses here were a bit more spread thin, but still gave him the care that he needed.  

He was able to get up and walk around as needed, and the 4th floor was a lot busier (obviously) then intensive care. 

When I did come here, the general hospital staff was friendly and helpful.  When I came in, there were a few volunteers at the front who assisted me in finding out where I needed to go to see my friend, and they would show me where to go.  The gift shop ladies were friendly and welcoming, along with all the other interactions with staff that I had here throughout my friends stay.

If you visit after 8PM, the front doors are locked, and you have to go through the emergency entrance and sign in with security.  I gave them my ID, they gave me a badge and I was able to walk upstairs to pick him up when it was time to come home.  I like that they have security here, so that way crazy people can't roam the hospital floors.  Well, at least if they do, they won't get very far anyways.

Overall a great experience, and I'm glad that they were able to save his fingers and the staff was awesome.",5

If you've ever worked in a hospital, you will notice that most staff do NOT knock on doors before they open (very intrusive), do NOT wash or sanitize their hands (why there are so many uncontrolled infections in healthcare), do NOT answer call lights in a timely manner, and do NOT spend enough time with their patients. 

I work in hospitals, nursing homes, and rehabs. I cannot sing enough praises about how well taken care of we were at Osborn, from ER, to inpatient, to surgical, to discharge. 

Everyone in the ER showed genuine concern and sympathy for the problem, spent actual time with us, and even knocked on the door with ""May I come in?"" before entering....INCLUDING the physicians! I was flabbergasted. 

Transitioning to an Inpatient room was just as flawless. Although we had one negative experience with a student nurse, all else went without a fuss. The nurses were on the call light within seconds. Housekeeping, aides, and nurses made us beyond comfortable with answering questions, getting meds on time, generally being super professional as well as polite. 

Even our admitting physician and eventual surgeon....actually made eye contact with us, answered a multitude of frightening questions, and wasn't making for the door the instant he walked in. And yes....even they knocked and waited for us to say it was ok to enter the room (I've been helping patients dress themselves or get on the toilet and most facilities, the MD just barges in and starts yapping away in medical jargon while the poor patient is butt naked or is having their rear end wiped...talk about loss of dignity).

236705,nDmposM7oRMeBsqBLps0rw,Aq6lSh0dfAYMsLoJf17BJQ,"Not sure why all the high reviews for ER. I think they have gone way down hill. Don't get me wrong: I think if you are an admit, the care is stellar. ED is just full of a bunch of insensitive burned out nurses. First of all, $7,000 for a 2 hour visit--only test performed was a CT. TO COMPARE, my mother was recently in ED and admitted for 3 days at Yavapai Med (talk about a GREAT hospital) and her bill for ALL was 16,000. Of course there will be adjustments made through insurance, but my Lord. No wonder such a screwed up med system. 

I could barely walk or stand up straight when I got there. Serious stomach issues & it looked like coffee grounds in my vomit--this was the ONLY reason I went. Look, I work in healthcare, I know good nursing and care. The guy who admitted (took vitals etc) was impatient and literally sprinted to the room I was to have ahead of me. I was a FALL risk and you run ahead of me when I can barely stand straight? The nurse I got, let's just say she's 30+ years into it, and not into it, if you know what I mean. Pillow? Nope. Freezing & shaking, not even taking note--Mom has to go get me 2 more blankets & make a pillow out of my jacket for my arthritic neck. H & P update? Nope. Height & weight? Nope. Check in on me? Nope. I ask for ice chips, sorry not until we get CT results. Ok, makes sense. After results? Never brings a thing. Personality of a old time nurse going through the motions. I'm not a human, just a long line of cattle to brand. 

Any follow-up from Scottsdale Osborn  Healthcare? Nope. Not a call, not a survey, not even by mail. So here's your survey: your ED has gone downhill. Glad I wasn't really, really sick, but when the doctor has to look up my autoimmune disease and drug, I get a bit scared. As for that nurse. Time to retire. You are really not helping anyone anymore. PS-I have probably only used the ER 3 times in all my life. We are not all ""frequent flyer drug seekers"". Stop stereo typing and some compassion.",2

The hospice we signed up with totally let us down - but Scottsdale Healthcare was great ... they took care of me as well as I had a health issue during this time. I grew up in Scottsdale and this facility has always been A1. In a time when there are serious concerns about medicine, the people who work at this hospital still understand about providing care for the patient and their families. I saw one review talking about costs. I worked until recently as a medical practice manager and interacted with medical insurance on all sorts of levels. It is unfortunate the costs are so high ... but typically the costs are the same in regard to tests within the Valley or anywhere else for that matter.

Where do I start, I visited this place Two days ago because I started having trouble breathing my Doctors office was closed obviously and I needed attention fast... So I decided to visit this shit hole of a place aka the Hospital. I go in and immediately I'm greeted with Attitude no one makes eye contact with you, the women in the front are Rude drama Queen Gossip Girl types. They take forever to ask you what are you are being seen for like why is this even the Emergency Room when the service is slow? But anyways as I wait to be seen throat nearly closing I finally get called back where I am greeted to more attitude from the Nurse taking me back to my room, I then get seated on a dirty bed with black stains on the sheets and the room had blood all ovee the floor smeared blood everywhere ok is that even safe? And then to make matters worse the Doctor comes in Doesn't make any kinda contact with me says open my mouth and says ah you have rhinitis  aka Hay Fever mhmm how would you know that not even checking me out she prescribed two prescriptions and says that will be all.. okay that was on the 5th today on the 7th my body started to react to the pills she prescribed my face went numb, sweaty palms,  headaches,  dry mouth to where I couldn't swallow and to top it off my throat was closing like again.  So I tried to hold it off because I know how shitty this place is but everything got worse and I freaked myself out so I decided to go see why ny face was numb etc maybe they could give me something for this, but nope here we go again same attitude as the night before,  they let some child run around with Lice for over 20 minutes before covering her head with something Really?  You know lice is contagious right and you are a nurse?? Um after waiting with no one in The ER besides me and the Girl with Lice I go back to the Room and Boom attitude really so I asked was there a race issue here at this hospital because I've been treated like crap on several occasions she couldn't look at me or make direct eye contact I asked her nicely to file a complaint she started to mumble a few words... Then about 4 people came in the a room one guy who said he's the Supervisor super rude Randy!  He was rude to a family member prior to me and I witnessed it when I went to visit,  Guess he didn't recognize me but I caught him in the act twice and finally called him out on it and his staff.  He claimed to see no Color this and that and processed to try to say I was Flipping it on him which is why I need to file a complaint people there are clearly unable to do their job and people need to voice how they feel without being attacked,  Because their scared to get a complaint anyways after dealing with Randy the Doctor comes in he must be a Rookie and of course he does the same crap the lady who prescribed me did I said ok my face is numb and explaining to him other things he starts beating on my knee Really ok I'm done I have to go like are you kidding me?  My knee isn't having the reaction its ny face I need something for my face Jesus christ I got up in frustration because everyone wanted to act Dumb tonight and not know how to treat an allergic reaction to medication are you prescribing me something else or are you just letting me sit here with a swollen numb face and neck ok well ok I just got up and left out no you won't be billing my insurance because I didn't even sign any papers to be admitted really weird I'm sick of being mistreated here even when I come in with positive spirits I'm getting a vibe from the workers and Doctors I will not be returning at all I don't care how far I have to travel I won't be going back again I will not tolerate being disrespected or treated unequally",1

How can you tell me the longest wait time is 58 minutes when I haven't been triaged after sitting there for 3 hours?!?!!?  Diagnosis and treatment took another 3 hours but that can not be factored into the wait time.

I could be wrong but I believe the wait time calculated is from the second time you are triaged.  Tier 1 your information and general complaint/symptoms vetted, Tier 2 is actual visitation with admissions nurse.  This means ""ER wait time"" advertised is NOT from when you walk in the door or even turn in your paperwork or get a bracelet, it most likely starts ticking after the triage nurse accepts you, but even then the time seems arbitrary.

I felt bad for the staff as it was quite busy last evening with certainly more pressing medical emergencies than my own.  For most of the night police outnumbered the doctor 5 to 1.  There were quite a few homeless people seeking treatment as well.  The inside of the ER would have you believe you were in an inner city hospital in NY/LA.

I felt the hospital staff was competent and made efforts to accommodate and went the extra step to comfort which was very nice given the volume they must manage with limited staff.  My doctor was competent, knowledgable, and took the time to explain my medical condition, treatment, and remedy.

The facility is FAR from state of the art.  It's amazing the staff is able to perform at such a peak level given the inadequacies of the facility.  I've been to hospitals in 3rd world countries are more technologically advanced - NOT kidding.

Tempe St. Luke's is a for profit hospital under IASIS Healthcare.  The keepsake name would probably lead you to believe otherwise.

I can not believe I am the first person writing about the deceptive times the for profit hospital is providing on the websites to get people in the door.  If you are basing your decision to go to Tempe St. Luke's on the real-time ""ER wait time"" displayed, you've been tricked.  If you are looking for a state of the art facility, this place may have been it a decade or two ago and is the wrong place for you.  If you have an emergency and you need a place close to home with competent staff to get you up and going again, and can look past everything else, then you may consider this facility.

Also beware Mountain Vista Medical Center and St. Luke's Medical Center Phoenix are IASIS Healthcare falsely publish the same ""ER wait time"" on their individual websites.",1

My wife was having chest pains so we went to have her get checked out. We had our 7 & 5 year olds with us and we filled out paperwork and waited for a while (about 20 mins or so) before she went in to see the nurse taking vitals. I was sitting in the waiting room with one of our daughters that was a sleep so I was slower getting up to go with my wife. When i knocked on the door to go back there was no answer so I spoke to a admitting person to see if she could let me back with my wife and she said no because I had my daughter. I told her I have had her back there before when we have been there in the past but she still said no. I said ok and sat back down when my wife came out with our other daughter for me to watch and she went back and after a while had passed she didn't come back out like what we have experienced in the past.

I knew because my wife was there because of chest pains that she would be admitted and then transfered by ambulance to Phoenix St. Luke's so I was ready for that. My wife then asked the nurse if we could come back to her bed to say goodbye and for us to workout details while she was in the hospital and the head nurse (the one who took the vitals) said that we couldn't be brought back because we had 18 people waiting with us and that was too many! We didn't have 18 people with us, we had myself and 2 little girls. Now there was a lot of people in the waiting area and many were latin (Mexican) and she made it sound very racist against people with families in the ER.

My wife spoke to her (head nurse) and told her we are a family of 4 and that's it and to say what she said was offensive on all levels and if that's the way we were going to be treated then we can go to another hospital! There was no apology from anyone on staff and if this is how the medical staff at Tempe St. Luke's is treating people we will not be back for any medical services at all.

Recently, around 8-9pm I finally called 911 for extreme pain and cramps I was feeling in my intestines that had not gone away for two hours. I was crying it was so painful. I had eaten some blueberries and I think that might have been it. When I arrived, I was rolled up in a gurney to the front desk where this nurse was busy typing into a computer. She said to me you will have to wait, I have forms to get done. I then sat there for a half an hour yelling in pain and nobody attended to me. They then rolled me into a room by myself and pulled the drapes around me as if I was bothering everyone. I sat in that room yelling and crying from the intense pain for at least an hour. I finally crawled out onto the floor and into the hallway because I could not take the pain anymore. The same nurse came up to me while I was on the floor in a fetal position and said ""here, sign this"". I said you have got to be kidding me, I am not signing anything until someone attended to me and gave me pain medication. She then said I should go back to my room because the floor had germs on it. I had to crawl back on my own. I saw other nurses and staff just walking around as if they could not hear my screams and the fact I was on the floor withering in pain. I realize there may have been others more in need than me but I swear I saw 3 elderly patients being wheeled around and they seemed calm. I finally had blood drawn and then the doctor took about a half hour before he came in and said we will give you pain medication. The doctor was just as uninterested as the nurse was. He never diagnosed anything. Nobody seemed to care except the one paramedic who brought me in and tried to comfort me after I got the pain medication, and I appreciate. When I was discharged, the same nurse said ""how do you plan to get home?"" I said I need a cab and she said ""we do not provide that service"". I did not imply the hospital had to pay, I just wanted to call a cab. I said I live on the same street Mill ave a few miles down the road. She then said I should walk home because they don't have cab information. It was 1am! Great service you guys. It was the worst pain I had ever felt and this was an emergency room. Do not go there unless you want terrible service and nurses that do not want to be bothered. Terrible for a hospital.",1

Everyone was very nice, they explained to me everything that was going on and I never felt like some peon behind a curtain that was forgotten about.  I got cold from the IV fluid and the nurse brought me blankets stat.  I've honestly never received such good care at an ER - even this same one!

If you're injured, I would hold on and try to make it elsewhere, before I ever allowed myself to be taken here and cared for. Pneumonia + terrible asthma resulted in my husband coming to this location. Apparently, they treat their ER patients in the hallway, seated next to the waste closet. I can't tell you how many times we had to get up from our seats to make way for the giant bin on wheels, dropping off soiled linens and garbage bags. Very nice. We weren't the only patients seated in this area, as we sat there and pretty much listened to 2 other patients' personal business- their insurance issues, their diagnosis and discharge instructions, etc. (HIPAA, anyone?) I have to say the most horrifying thing, was when they took my husband's blood, the person taking it (again, kneeling beside his chair in the middle of the hall) made the vial overflow onto the floor. it was casually wiped up with paper towels, but not before someone-the nurse, or the person who took the blood- actually STEPPED in it, tracking blood up and down the hall, all the way to the automatic doors before the elevators. There were obvious prints on the ground, and we just sat there wide-eyed as everyone-doctors, nurses, other staff members- walked through it without a care in the world. They finally got someone to clean the floors and she grabbed a damp paper towel and rubbed at the blood marks using her foot. No proper cleanup actions, no special solutions....just a paper towel and there was STILL blood. I couldn't believe. We did see an actual doctor and he diagnosed my husband with pneumonia while eating an ice cream bar. I've already submitted complaints to the Dept. of Health.

She spent a lot of time ultra sounding my veins and gave it a shot. She was smart enough to know when to give up quickly. She proceeded to get someone else. I didn't blame her. At least she was nice and personable for this hospital. Next enters I believe her name was Shoshana. Also had a personality. Thank god that's two... But with no prevail enters DOCTOR EGO. Not quite sure if his name was Lerner or not. Introductions do not mean very much by these people. Including some without ID tags on. But let's go with DOC EGO! He takes over and decides he can do this, he's got it get out of his way. He does poke number two. Requesting needles larger and faster with a vengeance... As he now heads to arm 2 after 5 stabs on one side. I told him it doesn't matter, no one side of my body is better than the other. Now there is blood dripping down my right arm all over the sheets. Left arm is now on its 6th STAB not poke and he's freaking out cause he must get this. Nurses are all around watching him throwing his EGO fit cause my veins won't let him win. I am seconds away from passing out blood is all over my arm and sheets and on my clothes. He decides to give me a break. Awesome cause I can't move either arm and he created large hematomas under my veins. He said he would give me a break at that point about 2 min went by and he wanted to start again. I could barely move my arms were numb sore and tingling. I said no more. At that point oh let's put a picc line in! We'll after 3 stabs that should have been done. Sometimes you must give up no matter how good you are or think you are. Then enters Linda day nurse, not too bad but probably way to busy to handle all that was going on in the ER. Dr. Ego was done and had left. Dr. Eye candy without the personality should have jumped in a bit sooner to help make a picc line decision much sooner.

I was born in this hospital but I will never go back.  The ER was the worse I have ever experienced.  I raised 4 kids did many ER visits and this was the first time I had ever needed to go.   I had a colonoscopy there on Monday, the next day I started bleeding non stop.  I ended up in the ER because I was beginning to lose consciousness.  Failure #1, I went to the triage desk and told the nurse my Dr. sent me here because I was bleeding and was about to pass out.  She gave me papers to fill out and sent me to the lobby.  I couldn't even sit up or I would get dizzy.  When my wife completed the paper work she called us back to her cubby hole and tried to get a blood pressure, she couldn't.  I told her 3 different times I was going to pass out and her response was ""Let's get your temperature"".  At that point I passed out and passed blood all over the floor.  Thank god my wife was there to catch me or I might have had a head injury to go with my bleeding.  When I started to come to I was on a gurney in a ER stall.  I could hear people talking.  The Dr. was asking for a blood pressure but they couldn't get one.  I knew I was alive because I could see the EKG monitor and I had a heart beat.  They started 2 I.V's,  one in each arm which made me freezing cold.  When they did finally get a blood pressure it was 58/44. I saw the nurse one more time after that.
Failure #2. A little while later the Dr. came back in, and this was the last time I saw him, and said I had a vasovagal reaction from seeing my own blood.  What Dominican Republic Med School did he go to.  My Hemoglobin went from 15.9 and dropped to 9.2.  A drop of 40%.  Maybe, just maybe that might be the issue of passing out.
Failure #3.  The gastroenterologist came by and ordered me to have a CT of the Abdomen and 2 fleets enemas to clean me out so he could see where I was bleeding from, while we waited for the colonoscopy team to come in.  The hour or so we waited for them to come in, nothing was done.  When my Dr. asked if they did the enemas, I told him no.  In disgust, he said to the team, ""this is going to be messy"".  They asked me to roll on my side and I asked if I should take my shorts off, which I had been laying in for the past 2 1/2 hours covered in blood.  The nurse just shook her head.
Failure #4.  I was admitted for 3 days until my blood pressure would come back up.  With an I.V. in each arm they kept me on fluids.  They only used the left arm to put the fluids in.  Never flushed the right I.V. the entire time I was there.   When it was time to go home, they removed both I.V.'s.  This is where the failure comes in.  2 days later my arm was hurting and the vein was huge and tender.  A clot had formed in the right arm where the I.V. was.  I was instructed to take aspirin and apply heat to the area and it should go away.  Well, it never did and now the vein which was as large as a pencil is now a shriveled up hard vein the size of a pencil lead and useless.
These were just the main blunders of the hospital, I guess I should be thankful I made it out alive.  But as you can see I won't make the mistake of going back to St. Rose ""Duh"" Lima anytime soon.  I will take my chances of the 20 minute drive to Las Vegas to receive any care.

While starting my review of how great this process was and what a positive experience I was having. I was approached by the security asking why I wAs taking pictures of the staff and what my intentions was. 

I explained to the 1st security officer (yes i say 1st security officer) I was just writing a review of the experience I was having here. He proceeded to inform me of HIPA laws that prevented me from taking pictures while in the hospital or of the property, it's staff members and patients. Being clueless of this fact I apologized and thought the subject closed (I guess I was wrong). 

3 additional reinforcements arrive surrounding my little chair (cutting off all exit access). There head interrogator proceeds to ask the 1st security officer. What's going on and what's my problem. This conversation takes place no more than 2 feet in front of me (annoyance builds). 

So it's the interrogator job now to re ask why am I taking pictures. Repeat the same information I was just given about hospital rules. He must of felt it was important to inform me that I was breaking the law and that it may be necessary to confiscate my phone. 

Now I'm surrounded by security with hands on there protection devices (im patiently annoyed now) and 5 or 6 nurses coming out to find out what was going on (looky loos) in waiting area. This whole situation started to become so amusing. I thought of getting up real quick and going for the exits. 

I was saved by the nurse who called me to the ER (bless you). She offhandedly asked me what was going on in the waiting area. I thought of telling her there was a crazy yelper outside. But I ended with a shrug of my shoulders.

The checkin process, response time, care, and professionalism your staff had this day was absolutely outstanding. The communication throughout each step helped to alleviate any anxiety that may have been felt through this process. 

I was having a bout with kidney stones AGAIN. Grrrrr. Dam you stones.

I checked in online for an apt at 12:00 for the delima campus. U fill in general information then submit it. I received a registrar phone call 15 minutes later. That helped pre register me. 

I arrived 1/2 hour prior to ER appt. the following positive things happened from this point. 
1.I checked in with the pre register station. They had some paperwork already there waiting for me. I was asked confirming questions then taken to the check in. 
2. At check in More confirming questions then a form to complete. 
3.I was directed to vitals next where they took my blood pressure and temperature. I was met by Dr. Emery at this time who asked some questions then told me the round of tests he wanted to have done. (I am not even in the ER yet)
4. 5 minutes after that I was forwarded to the insurance copayment lady who had me in and out of the in 5 minutes.
This entire process took about 20 minutes. I was called in to see the ER nurse on time. Who had blood drawn, medication ready to be given the minute I went into the ER area. I even had the ct scan technician waiting. 

The only reason 5 stars not given. I have deep veins and I hate needles. So three nurses and 4 attempts later at an IV   And 1 IV bubble that built when the needle slipped. 

My favorites ER nurse Jacqueline from Jamaica. Going to miss you. Well not really if I never have to come back. You made my experience with your up beat personality and friendly bedside manner.",4

Dr Gohwari was the ER doctor and didn't even listen to myself or my daughter as to our concerns for bringing her there.

It was as if he had already diagnosed her before we even spoke to him.

He and his nurse Paul were very pompous in attitude and thought they walked on water you could tell.

Bottom line if I hadn't requested he actually check her airways he would have sent us home with nothing but a breathing treatment and some pepcid, but luckily they took a chest xray and found bronchitis.

Several days later we found out she had an Autonomic Seizure and because he wouldn't listen to us he missed it.

She has epilepsy already but never had a seizure like that before and I tried to explain that to him and tell him I was confused as to what I had seen but he was too busy and important to hear me.

Then a female nurse came out to the waiting room to let me know if I wasn't happy I could take my daughter to another hospital with a pediatric ER.

Hmmmm I kinda thought if my daughter wasn't breathing well I could go to the closest ER for help but I guess not.

Any way if you have a choice I wouldn't take my child there if I were you and if you have to try not to get him as a doctor.

Fax is impossible to get through. Call is worse have called in more then 4x. Two of those calls where over 20 minute wait time and a third was 30min. Just to drop off copies of my lab work took 20min wait after checking in and 1hr the first time then was told I'd get a call back after they determined the urgency of my appt from lab work. 5 days passed when I finally called back to request an appt to the same person I had been dealing with the whole time. Sucks I started this process to get an appt after receiving me referral turned into a 3week process and my insurance was termining. They still couldn't fit me in before my insurance termed. Giving them another chance. This is clearly a issue with this particular staff member. I'm hoping to resolve this issue.,1

Last night I took my daughter to the Base ER and ended up being transferred over to Sunrise Children's hosp because they couldn't give her the care she needed at the base. We arrived by ambulance transfer at SCH and immediately got great care and attention. The staff at Sunrise is amazing and caring and wonderful and if you ever need to have your child in a hospital it's the place to go! Our first nurse Sunny was sweet and kind and really did a great job getting us settled in at 4am. Robin our 2nd nurse was also very kind and sweet and did an amazing job. Dr. Hendrickson who performed my daughter's procedure was beyond accommodating with our million questions and did such a fabulous job. All in all our 24hr stay at Sunrise was nothing less than fantastic and I hope that if in the future my children need hospitalization that Sunrise is where we go!! Thank you to all the wonderful staff that took such great care of my girl!!,4

My wife recently gave birth to our third child. We chose Sunrise Children's because her OB/GYN is assigned to that hospital system. The surgery side is great and the only reason this isn't a 1-star review. They were patient and caring.

However, the nurses in the maternity ward are about as close to useless as one with any medical training can get. I went and sat with my wife for almost 10 hours today and her nurse came in one time. One time. They did not give her pain medicine in accordance with their own schedule. A nurse told her to wipe her own blood off the floor and off her legs last night, 12 hours after having a c-section. I'm not saying that my wife is helpless or deserves to be worshipped, but she just had major surgery. You would expect health care professionals to at least care for her health.",2

All 3 of my children were born here and we have been to the Children's ER a few times.  Most recently my daughter fell down at recess and cut her chin.  The whole visit was as pleasant as it could be.  When you arrive you check in on touch screen kiosks.  In the waiting area there are TV's playing kids movies and coloring books and crayons.  We waited less then 5 minutes before we were called back.  The longest wait of the visit was for the numbing gel to take effect (better for kids than a shot), even that wasn't bad, they put on cartoons for my daughter to help pass the time.  When we were done the doctor gave my daughter some of the leftover supplies to take home and play doctor.  She loved that.  The staff here is excellent.  They are great with the children and parents.  Little things like having cartoons playing and giving out popsicles, go a long way when it comes to small children.  I've seen them calm down upset parents and be patient with little ones who weren't easy to handle.  You never want your kids to have to go to the hospital but when they do Sunrise is always my first choice.",4

A relative came in for surgery - they were running behind so he waited an extra 90 minutes before the surgery got underway.  And their ICU was full so he waited in recovery for 7 hours before he finally got into the ICU.  We spent 12 hours in the surgery waiting room, which was filled with uncomfortable chairs, TVs with no audio, and no windows.  Blargh.  

The ICU took good care of him, and he said the food was ok.  (The cafeteria food was decent and cheap.)

This one, I think, is the one you want to land at for your scheduled surgery. It is clean. The nurses at my mother's room seem on the ball. They put her in the woman's ward, and because she's had bad experiences at other hospitals with roommates, they gave her a private room on request. It is normally the isolation room, which is a bit weird. She had a problem with the television, and despite being short handed, maintenance got it fixed within a couple of hours.

Amenities: well, all hospitals in Las Vegas have free wifi these days. Theirs is a pretty easy system to log in, and it was fast. They also have complimentary valet, which I appreciate. I broke a vase and had to buy a new one at the little shop: they gave me a discount for red day. Nice.

Cost: I don't know yet, my mother's insurance is picking it up.

Cafeteria Food: Cafeteria is clean, but cash only. On the day I went they had baked chicken, thai veggies and fried rice on the hot menu. I went for this and a bottle of mango juice, which was about 7 bucks all together. The baked chicken was dry/flavorless, but the fried rice and veg was surprisingly flavorful for hospital food. Except the veggies were drowned in oil. I saw the nurses carrying out bowls of just fried rice.

Overall, it is well lit and clean and if you had a choice for elective surgery, the rooms are much nicer than at UMC or Valley.",4

I found a majority of the support staff to be surly and downright rude. The nursing staff was about 50/50 as far as being caring and knowledgeable as opposed to the other half who were incompetent at best, and dangerous at worst. The orthopedic surgeon who treated me allowed a staph infection to go unchecked for 4 weeks before performing basic lab work and placing me on antibiotics. as a result of this, I had to have several more surgeries to cut away infected tissue and reconstruct the soft tissue around my knee. The rehab staff was one of the few positives about my experience with this facility, and they are to be commended for their caring attitude and professionalism.

They were very patient with our immediate family of 20 coming in and out vising with her.

There seems to be sane people here (working and visiting)- not shady types that make you ask the question, ""What the hell am I doing here?"" The waiting rooms are pretty good size. Parking is on both sides of the hospital on Maryland Parkway. I always see security guards on segways, which is a good thing.

I've keep my wound, clean.

wash it with anti-bacteria soap very often. Now my wound was on it way, to healing already. But, my wife was concern about me and keep telling me to go check it out. Oh By the way, I tear up my house to look for the spider and found it on my 3rd day after my bite. I am a very clear person and my house is organize. It was the only spider in the house behind the drawer. I caught the spider and put it in a glass container. So I headed to the hospital, after my wife got home from work so she could watch the kids. As I got to the hospital the entrance was lock, and the sign said to go through the emergency entrance. I went in with my container. Talk to the reception, nicely. I am here to ask question about my spider bite. He really could answer me, and told me that the doctor will have to see and give diagnose. so I said ok. Then they ask me for my insurance which I have. so I give it to them. After he got all my information, I notice that the doctor was standing behind him listening and walk away. At first, I didn't know it was the doctor who was gonna diagnose me. After they go all my information, then she came back and I ask her all the questions, that is bothering me. She said it ok and ask me if I got a Tetanus shot. I told her,""NO"". This to me took less than 5 mins. Took my blood pressure and send me to a room to wait. I waited for 10 mins. Then a nurse came in, gave me a shot and prescribe 2 medicine to take. ok. I know my insurance is 80/20. Then I went up to the counter to pay. I was told the bill would be $202 for me and the whole amount is $1020. I was to my shock. I'm like what? I ask again. then I ask for a print out and was to that the computer was down.

The hospital took his info quick and got his vitals & stuff...I had to park the car and left him in the admitting section.  When I got back to the admitting section they were done with him (with IV & stuff) and ready to wheel him in the exam room.

It took the doctor less than 10mins to get to him and asked questions before he ordered for CT Scan. After done with the tests, pain meds, etc...doctor came back with results and gave him prescription for meds to buy and was discharged after.  Hubby felt a little bit better but still in pain (pain killers were still active in his body).

Total time spent in ER: 3 hours...We were still able to catch our (7:30am) flight in the morning to go back home. 

Updated info after the trip to the ER:
As of today 4/4/12....My hubby just received a bill from the hospital for the remainder to be paid (after insurance was applied)...$900+ ($800+ just for the metabolic panel test).  With the kind of economy that we have right now...can anyone (aside from the rich people) just pay that amount as is without any hardship???

My hubby's father who was hospitalized (heart related) recently paid less than my hubby's kidney stone incident!!!  The overall bill that was charged (before insurance) was over $11k----YUP, you read it right! That's just for the ER trip for the kidney stones and was released from the hospital after 3 hrs.

Initial observation of the hospital given the fact it's in the ghetto 4 stars
The staff in the ER waiting area 2 Stars
The cliental 1 star-unless they are here for a Jerry Springer tryout 
Cafeteria 3 Stars
The nurses in the heart of the hospital 5 stars
Doctors...... we'll good luck finding them, no really! 1 won I met was as alive as the morgue and had as much personality as a wet noodle.

That saying, a solid 3 stars for this joint. I wanted to say thank you to the nurses in the section my Dad was visiting. They were not only on the ball but had a great sense of humor, enjoyed being their & given the circumstances was a pleasure to meet.",3

He would check in as he promised and not let me leave without proper treatments. Admitted despite some improvement to critical care unit and nurses here are helpful. I m self sufficient for most part so I don't use call light but can imagine those who want constant nurse attention. Overall wait time each time you hit light is 5 mins. Not bad  unless something bad happened. The bed is awesome as it sense when u are at the edge and beeps. 

ER it was great. Could be I was brought by EMT vs walk in that determined urgency for them.

Room in CMU small and toilet is outside. No private place to do business. Definitely your visitors need not use it! And those who stay over will hear and can see U in elements so choose wisely who you want over with you.",4

Boyfriends mom was in a coma for 2weeks and when she woke up she was hardly acknowledged by nurses, when she needed that extra help because she couldn't talk. They sent her home before they should have because she didn't have insurance that would pay for all the care. Boyfriend was in a car accident recently and ambulance took him to sunrise. The wait wasn't too terrible, but he went there complaining of back pain and all they did was give him a Tylenol and 2 bags of saline and several exceptionally large bills to pay. Saw an actual doctor for a total of 2 minutes the whole time we were there and yet received a physician's bill of $900. Hospital told us they would help with the hospital bill of 2,000 and reduce it to just under 300, but refused to give me a paper stating that. And now they are sending bills for the full amount. ER staff is rude and uncaring. They are unprofessional and talk down to you. I tried to tell the nurse that my boyfriend's IV want dripping any fluid, she dismissed my comment without looking and we were waiting for hours for the IV to finish before another nurse came and fixed it. He was bleeding a little and had glass in his arm and hand and while his nurse had time to chat and gossip with other er staff, she couldn't find time to clean his wounds.

Last time I went there was yesterday. Seven months pregnant and bleeding vaginally a lot. The hospital is very close to my house, other wise we would have gone to st. rose sienna, where I plan to deliver. Anyway, I get to the er and obviously my boyfriend and I are panicked. The ER nurse turns us away and tells us we have to find our way to labor and delivery. It was kind of far and we were nervous to get lost. I wasnt offered a wheelchair even though I told her and the security guard I was bleeding a lot and was shaking. We find our way to labor and delivery and luckily there was no wait, I just had to fill out one page of paperwork. The nurse there was very nice. Her name was Kimberly and she called my nerves a lot and answered my ""what if"" questions honestly, but without scaring me. Doctor was kind of rude and made it sound like this was our fault for not being careful enough during sex. Ultrasound tech was very busy and seemed reluctant to answer my questions. They were concerned that I was having contractions, so they gave me fluids. Them they said I could leave, even though I was still having contractions..
I overall hate this hospital. The only good thing was having Kimberly as my nurse.",1

They promised me that I will be helped but ignored me for hours. I asked one nurse for a blanket and she said, the hallway I was sitting helplessly was not her section and walked sway.

304904,yqH7wX0Oa8kF03SgtLtN4g,mBGzE7gsSwsnVSAhsdvSJQ,"Our experience was wonderful with the Emergency Department, while in Vegas for a conference several years ago.

I was rushed in by EMTs after hours of vomiting (eventually blood). They asked about alcohol consumption. I don't drink, but the EMTs figured it was food poisoning. They said about half of their calls are food poisoning. It's very common on The Strip. They asked me about my dinner, I told them it was Panda Express, and they said it was probably ""bad Panda"". (This was in the Venetian. Will never eat there again, and to date have never eaten at any other Panda!)

They put me in a wheelchair (the hotel cooperated wonderfully) and we went to the hospital by ambulance. They started an IV en route. I freaking hate IVs but they had no choice, given the duration of vomiting and obvious dehydration. They were very careful and stayed completely unruffled. They were angels. Amazing how sweet and calm they are with such a stressful job, in the middle of the damn night! 

When we arrived at Sunrise, it was odd to see nurses smoking, but it was Vegas after all. 

They put me in a private room with a fantastic nurse. The doctor saw me right away, a really sweet guy with a smile and good bedside manner. They made sure I was totally comfortable with blankets (IVs can make you freaking COLD!! Brrr!) and a place for my sweetheart to sit. 

As sweet as they were, I wanted to get the hell out and said so. I was a damn mess. They said I could leave as soon as I peed. Pee is their indicator that the dehydration has been solved. The staff all remained cheerful throughout.

The doctor explained that the eateries on The Strip often serve old, unfit for consumption food because they are open 24 hours. You never know what you're going to get. The sanitation is questionable and freshness often nil. Made us want to just get groceries and make our own food next time we're in Vegas. 

Hours went by, and I finally peed. They let me go, and even let me take a plastic barf pan with me in case I had any more nausea. I still have it to this day, and it's pink, so it coordinates with my office. They gave me a prescription for nausea pills. The pills were great, they really helped. (Of course if you are passing contaminated food or something, that needs to come out, and the pills won't stop that.)

The missing star is for the exit wait. We had to wait quite a while for the staff at the counter to take our payment. It wasn't busy, so we didn't know what the holdup was. In my condition, it seemed like forever. That did allow some time for a cab to show up, to get back to our hotel. 

I glanced at the other reviews and am so sad that so many have had terrible experiences. I guess we truly lucked out because it could have been dreadful. I don't ever look forward to getting sick but Sunrise made it a much less atrocious experience than it could have ended up.

The Venetian was incredible in letting us extend our stay for another night, even though we hadn't reserved it, because I was too frail to get on a plane when the sun came up. We changed our return flight. They were pretty booked up too, so we were very appreciative. 

They also provided a wheelchair for me to get downstairs, through the lobby, and out to the cab when the time came. If you've been to the Venetian, you know that's a lot of real estate to cover. It's gigantic. One of the biggest properties in the world. 

If you find yourself vomiting so hard and for so long that blood is coming out and you're too hoarse to speak, don't ignore it! Call the paramedics (the hotel did it for us) and re-hydrate. Dehydration can kill.",4
304905,ZDJ7PFyJGDEtodqWLYi5gg,mBGzE7gsSwsnVSAhsdvSJQ,"My mom was sent here by ambulance from an out-of-town hospital when she was  dizzy, unable to walk and a CT scan of her brain showed ""spots that are concerning"". She layed in her room for 24 hours before being seen or any procedures being ordered. Finally off to an MRI then another 24 hour wait with no info, no doctor. Nurses were unresponsive to bed alarms and sat around chatting. We were directly in front of the nurses station. I could see them at their desks. One walked by and simply asked ""Are you ok?"" ""Oh you mean cause the alarm is going off? She sat back down."" She walked in, rolled her eyes, turned it off and walked out. Then the lady in the next bed (fresh from heart surgery) set off her alarm. NO RESPONSE from the nurses. I said quite loudly ""Good thing no one has fallen out of bed!"" It was a full minute before anyone came in-all the while the alarm is blaring! The nurses assigned to mom were nice enough while in the room but when I approached them at their desk it was quite the opposite. The only plus was that they let me stay in her room as long as I wanted with no curfew. OK enough about the 5th floor nurses. 

I requested to complete a HIPPA release form. The case manager came in and had no idea what I was talking about. ""You don't know what HIPPA is?"" ""No I don't. I don't do that"" A person that works in health care doesn't know what HIPPA is???? It was good that she at least ordered a wheelchair and walker.

When Dr. Swenson finally came in with the awful diagnosis he delivered the news abruptly and without compassion. He ordered her discharge and said I could call him if I had any questions. A bit later I tracked him down in the hall and asked him a question. He dismissed me with a pat on the shoulder and ""just move forward"" then turned and walked away. I have since tried to get in touch with him for medication questions and a work release letter for my daughter. 4 attempts 0 responses. I later discovered he is a ""hospitalist"" and gets paid by the hospital for each consultation not for being a decent doctor. 

Once moved to the discharge area we waited an hour for someone to come in and actually give us the paperwork to leave. There was a woman in the hall yelling that she had been waiting 2 hours and had to get on a plane. They begrudgingly helped her.

Signed Release of Information paperwork with a nurse before we left. 1 week later the Release of Info department hasn't gotten it and I had start over. The guys in this department were great and walked me through what I had to do since we now live in northern California.

On the plus side the cafeteria is good. Valet parking is great.",1

Our billing was processed to our insurance incorrectly, leading us to paying the bill directly to the hospital. That was in June of 2013. We've been the go between the hospital and the insurance. We got the two parties on the phone, the insurance talked the billing department through the correct procedures. Our insurance sent the hospital a check, which they cashed. Now, when we call to get our refund (because the hospital has cashed the insurance companies check, and therefore should be able to pass us our check), they say it will be 90 days. Silly that my wife and I had to spend 10-15 hours on the phone with them resolving this issue over the last 6 months, and we still have 3 more to go. We anticipate many more hours on the phone, but no more involvement with Sunrise on a medical basis.",2

I have SVT (heart condition) and it was acting up, making my resting heart rate 160bpm. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because the parking lot was a far walk and they didn't have any wheelchairs available as well as the fact that there some really sketchy looking people in the waiting room (one was talking to himself about how much he hates America). 

Check-in took about 5 minutes and I was called back about 3 minutes later. They let my boyfriend come back with me which I really appreciated. They did an EKG on me and took me straight to the room. A nurse was waiting for me at the room and literally never left my room the entire time except to go get supplies. 

I saw a doctor immediately and he was very familiar with my condition. He came into my room about 4 times during the 2 hours I was there. 

The nurses and doctors were all very helpful and friendly. I was completely comfortable and calm. The bed was actually comfy for a hospital bed. And they provided a chair for my boyfriend to stay with me.

      First you need a visitors pass, you get it at the front desk (photo ID required) and you snake your way through the maze of hallways following the signs the best you can. Finally after the adventure of finding the right place me and my family entered the Delivery Triage.
       Upon entering I walked streight to the front desk where the receptionist is supposed to be. The nurses were in the back chatting away about a upcoming wedding. They ignored me as I politely asked to see my sister. I waited a minute for a response but the arrogant nurses kept talking to each other not even glancing toward the front desk. So I said, ""okay I guess I'll just sit and wait"". 
         I sat down and started reading my book for a couple minutes and after receiving no contact with the nurses I got fed up and went to the front desk again, waited for them to notice me, but yet again no staff member helped me. So I went to the visitors door to give a knock to get their attention, finally. 
          I gave that solid oak door 7 good knocks (to get their attention and to get them to start doing their jobs) and the lady behind the desk turned arround and gave me that 'how dare you' face. I was just happy that finally someone was going to help. 
She kept staring at me and I was in no mood to talk to them after I was disrespected and ignored so I pointed at the door so they could unlock it so I could visit my sister. A lady soon opened the door and asked what I wanted. And I said I'd like to visit my sister.
         She walked me to her little room, I finally got there and she was happy. We talked, I made her laugh and got her all comfortable. She's in labor now but I felt like reviewing to let you know my experience with sunrise hospital.

I was about 6 months pregnant and had a 102 fever along with a nasty stomach virus, on top of the terrible morning sickness I had been experiencing. I went to the emergency room because I couldn't keep any fluids down and the fever was getting higher. When I arrived at the hospital obviously very pregnant and very sick, I still had to wait. Once I got back into the emergency room they placed me in a chair in the hallway. I waited there for almost an hour until a doctor came to talk with me. He stated I just had a stomach bug, he prescribed me some anti nausea medication and sent me home. I wasn't even placed in a room or put on an I.V. even though I was obviously very dehydrated. The next day I was in the shower and nearly passed out. My husband found me lying on the bathtub floor very out of it. He rushed me to an emergency room at a different hospital where they immediately got me in and put me on an I.V. while they checked to make sure everything was okay. I later explained to them my experience the day before which even made them upset. They said that the level of dehydration I was experiencing could have potentially put me into a premature labor. A couple weeks later I received a bill from Sunrise Hospital for almost $2,000! For what?! I refused to pay the bill, for they endangered my life as well as the life of my unborn daughter.

This old lady tried to force kick me out of my room so she can have people clean...ugh I just had a baby dumb dumb. I had random people that werent my nurse coming into my room when I'm breastfeeding my son. They will sometimes use my bathroom area as a kick it spot. So I had to get up out of bed while in pain at least 10 times a day to make sure my door was fully shut so they can't come in. What a pain. Literally. I hAd to also tell all these nurses I've met to close the door behind them because they will leave it open and next thing u know random people is in my room. Dangerous. Even people that aren't employed. The stupid nurse had our paperwork and turned it in having things crossed out without our knowledge and admin won't accept it so now my sons father is not on the birth certificate. Idiot! Little things like that now I have to go correct. I was so drained, tired, and in horrible pain after giving birth I literally couldn't get out of bed fast. Everything was hurting. Then I get this nurse who was trying to force me to go to breastfeeding class after I just told her if it's optional than I'm not going. I read all the breastfeeding things I need to know and etc. I mainly didn't want to go because I couldn't even keep my eyes open. I felt weak and exhausted. She kept forcing me sevetal times after i politely declined every time, but after 20 times trying to make me go i finally stated again to her rudely I'm not going that's the end of it. She backed off. I've been breastfeeding my son for almost a year. I have no problems. Another occasion happened when I took my son in for a circumcision. OMG! After my son went thru surgery, I came back there to calm him down. He was crying hysterically because of course the pain from the surgery. Tell me why this old witch grabs my son from me snd sticks a pedialyte down his throat where his crying was less quiet because the nipple from the bottle was blocking his throat. I told this witch don't be sticking it down his throat to stop him from crying he just came out of surgery. I grabbed my son back and she said he's such a drama queen. Excuse u ugly bitch. That got me mad. My son needed me do much I couldnt curse the bitch out. His crying had me occupied. After taking the bottle out of his mouth his crying was worse!

After finding out that Fremont Medical Center could not accommodate me again, I swung by here figuring I would just leave if it was a nightmare.  I was surprised by the very pleasant experience.  Everyone was so nice and upbeat.  Even when you feel like crap, it's hard not be grumpy when everyone who works there is smiling and happy.  In and out in less than 1 hour with a prescription for the drugs I needed.  This was 8am on a Thursday, mind you, but I've never experienced such quick turnaround at any clinic at any time of day in Las Vegas.  This is my new go-to place.

Note, they won't take same-day appointments for primary care - for new patients, at least.  You have to go to urgent care, which is a bit of a bummer but it all worked out in this case.  Yay!",4
324764,b7lj1t86-L1Iz8dL27-hPg,FLEgS3ljM7Wy9mxtA9BS4w,"I'm not sure what to say.

I came here on 12/21 for a on-fire sore throat that I had for four days.  Waited for about 10 minutes and was taken into the back.  The nurse took my vitals and placed me in a room.  The doctor came in, looked at my throat and determined that I had strep throat.  Now, I've never had strep throat, but I thought that you need to take a swab of your throat and do a test on it.  But whatevs.  I'm allergic to penicillin so he put me on Levaquin.

By 12/25, I was breaking out in hives and on 12/27 I headed back into UMC with hives and swelling all over my body.  The nurse taking my vitals asked why he gave me Levaquin.  I answered that I didn't know.

Then I was put back into a room and a different doctor came in and asked why the previous doctor gave me Levaquin.  I answered ""i'm not sure, i'm not a doctor..haha!""  So he put me on steriods, z-pack and some anti-itch medicine.

On 12/29 my eyes were almost swollen shut, I was incredibly weak from not being able to keep down food.  So my husband took me to the ER and they gave me an IV full of steroids, pepcid, benadryl and something else.  They then gave me a prescription for prednisone, pepcid and told me to keep taking the z-pack and anti-itch medicine.

With the nurse and doctor at UMC questioning this doctor's prescription, makes me think that the doctor screwed up.  I guess that's why they call it ""medical practice?""  I'm not totally mad, cause we didn't know that I was allergic to Levaquin, but it makes me think twice about going back to somewhere where other people are questioning what the doctor is doing.",3

Positives: Nurse who checked me in was very very nice, may not know anything about medicine but very very nice.

Negatives: Got there when it opened and still waited 2 hours, saw doctor for 20 seconds he said my lungs were cloudy (he didn't do an X-ray) and listened to my chest for a second literally.  That is all he did I told him I didn't feel well and before I could elaborate he gave me a antibiotic and said follow up with your doctor in 4 days.  He also gave me a codeine and ibuprofen (I'm a gastric bypass patient and can't take ibuprofen) 

After seeing the doc I still had to wait another 30 mins. 

Very disappointing I was hoping he would have spent a bit more time or at least pretended to be interested.

Took my mom here who had abdominal pains. We sign in, wait our turn to get the paperwork started. Then, CRASH! !! The front door suddenly bursts open. Then, one heavily tattooed Filipina young woman runs in and finds the bathroom.   We clearly hear her  moaning and heaving her guts out for about a minute.   All the waiting room people turn to see her stagger to the waiting chairs as her boyfriend begs to see someone right away. The admitting clerk says wait...""Let me talk to the doc."" A third person person comes in behind them with low pants that exposes his underwear.  Five seconds behind his friends and five years behind in fashion. As vomiting girl gives her info, she runs to the bathroom again for another round of barfing.  We are all hoping she's okay, comes back out and tries to finish her paperwork. And luckily for her, she gets called to the doc right away.

My mom's primary doctor down the street could not accept any appointments becaue he was sick.  Ironic, but even doctors get sick.  So we ended up here.  It's not the newest, cleanest place, but acceptably so.  First they ask what's wrong and decide if you get to cut the line like the vomiting vixen.  They get all the insurance info, and you wait for awhile...How long? it all depends on who's in front of you. The admitting clerks are quick and professional and friendlly as well.  

We end up waiting twenty minutes before seeing the doctor. My mom tells them about her issues. At this point,  I was asked to leave the room because the female Filipina doctor has to do the ever memorable rectal exam.  When I return, the doc says to us, ""You need to go to the Emergency Room at the hospital right away"".  It turned out to be great advice, as my mom was admitted a few hours later for an infection.

For what they are, they do fairly well.  If it's beyond a simple problem, of course this is not the place for you.  But if  you have the cold, flu, sprained ankle, etc. this is an option for those in the area. Medical Care in this town is among the worst I have seen anywhere (particularly Summerline Hospital). I never found out whatever happened to the girl who threw up, but hopefully she is okay.  Maybe she got sick from seeing her male friend's dirty underwear.",4

The doctor brushed me off, even when BOTH nurses I talked to seemed concerned. I had a bad reaction to the medication I was given. I called in and the doctor said there was ""nothing (she) could do"" and that if I wanted further help I had to go to an emergency room. When I brought up the fact that I had practically begged for the test that would have prevented the reaction, she hurriedly blew me off again and hung up on me. Now I have received a bill for a test that was not actually run on me - or if it was, it was run without my consent and the results were not given to me. I will be disputing the bill, and I am never coming back to these people. The only reason it's not one star is because the nurses are nice, and that is unfortunately rare.",2

I haven't really had any concerns with her as I've only been going to her for healthy annual exams.  I've recently had some actually medical issues and she completely blew me off.  She said that mild arthritis showed in an x-ray.  I asked if mild arithritis would cause the extreme back pains that I had been experiencing.  She wanted to refer me to a rheumatoidologist.  I inquired whether the back pain could be connected to my foot bunions that I have.  I have had issues with them in the past when I worked service industry jobs through college and actually had referrals for surgery.  She was adamantly against me seeing an ortho for foot correction surgery.  She then said that my debilitating back pain could be ""in my head"" due to chemical imbalances of my depression.  I commented that I've been coping with depression for 15 years and this back pain has been occurring for 4 weeks - she immediately then advised that it could be Lupus or Rheumatoid Arthritist or an Auto-immune defficiency.  This really threw me off and I asked if any of these conditions had prevalence with genetics or hereditary, as none of these things run in my family - no response.  All of which, she was not making eye contact and she spoke condescendingly.  It was as though the more questions I asked, the more frusterated she got with me.  Needless to say, I am now looking for a new primary.  I am giving two stars as I have been happy with the rest of the services provided at the UMC Primary/Quick Care.",2

Had to pay up front before I was actually seen by a doctor ($50).

The ""receptionists"", and I use that term extremely lightly,  were loudly talking the entire time and snapped gum during the conversations they had with the other patients.

The nurse who saw me was a complete sweetheart and asked lots of questions about what symptoms I was experiencing.  The doctor on the other hand had a terrible bedside manner. He entered the room with his head down and stayed that way the entire time he talked to me. Informed me I had an upper respiratory infection (without actually giving me a check up), and wrote a prescription for antibiotics then walked out.

The nurse came back and asked me if I wanted to take something now to get started on before I went to the pharmacy, I declined. Then she advised me I was all set to go.

I understand it's an urgent care facility,  which in a nutshell is basically a drive thru clinic, but I expected a little more for the amount I paid.

They have a big sign next to the check in area that reads ""all patients will receive medical treatment regardless of ability to pay"" but didn't feel like arguing with them.

My first visit, came in the early afternoon, was the one that took what I felt was an excruciatingly long wait time in the lobby (might have also been the middle of flu season). Based on my limited observation, I would still recommend (if possible) timing your visit for as early in the day as possible, to avoid spending 3 hours here waiting for medical care.

The staff in the front may not be the friendliest, but I was never treated rudely, so I have no complaints. Can the front office staff be better? Yes, there are much room for improvement.

The nurses and doctors working here are friendly, knowledgeable and caring. If you have questions or concerns, they still take the time to address them. So as much as I hate having to visit a doctor's office, coming here and being treated professionally and with dignity by the medical staff here is as pleasant of an experience as one could hope for.

Do they always get the diagnosis right?  That would probably be no. But for the basic medical emergencies, you should be in good hands here.  For the tougher medical conditions, they will always refer you to follow up with specialists.

In most hospitals people go to the ER because it is a genuine emergency. Because this is a teaching hospital many go to the ER for primary care. My wife went in at 830am Thursday complaining of kidney/back issues. We waited about 45 min as others came and went through triage before us even though they came in after us.

After asking the triage nurse what is going on they tell me that anyone that comes in complaining of chest issues automatically goes to the front of the triage line. Now it is fairly obvious that some of these chest issue patients are not having a heart attack. They are laughing and smiling and otherwise having a regular morning reading the paper. My wife is now in tears but we cannot get bumped to the front because it is kidney not chest.

He suspected my gallbladder and called ahead to the hospital with this information. After a few hours of seemingly every expensive test they could run except a HIDA scan, and after a very rude interrogation in which I was treated as a drug-seeking addict, I was released with pain medication, antibiotics, and a suggestion to follow up with my doctor.

Two days later I was rushed to a different hospital where the correct test was performed. It was in fact my gallbladder, something a HIDA scan would have found had Phoenix Baptist bothered to run it. I had emergency surgery and was in the hospital for nearly a week.

I should also mention that they kicked out the lady in the ER bed next to me because she didn't have insurance, although she had dangerously high blood pressure. Since she came in not for her BP but for a sprained knee they told her she'd have to be treated by her primary care doc. She was crying and saying how terrible she felt and would they please help her, and they refused. They spoke to this elderly lady just abominably.

568956,cN1JTsn_B4rAkMjHs9nXXA,XnaJxI5blaB6ijV6OwKF0g,"**DO NOT DELIVER YOUR BABY HERE**
This review is for the L&D and Postpartum Departments. 

Do not be fooled by the beautiful delivery rooms like I was.

During my intake L&D Nurse Danielle told me that upon delivery, my newborn would be taken straight from me and put in the NICU for monitoring. I was very surprised to hear this and when I tried to explain that my OB mentioned nothing of the sort, she copped an attitude and told me she wouldn""t discuss it any further. Naturally, I became extremely distraught and remained that way for my entire 36 hour labor. Delivering a baby is stressful enough and the nurses are supposed to help you not add to the stress. Out of the 5 different nurses I had in L&D, there was only one nurse who wasn't horribly rude. Nurse Roberta. It was her first delivery working at a new hospital. Although I suspect her kindness had something to do with being new, I am thankful for it nonetheless. 

My beautiful baby was born PERFECT and (surprise!) ends up staying with us the entire time in the recovery room. I was excited to be transferred to the Postpartum Unit so I could relax with my new family and hopefully get some peace. Nope. The nurses were even worse. Even months later, I still get so upset just thinking about how rude everyone was. It was the happiest days of my life but there is a huge dark cloud hanging over those memories and that hurts my heart. My husband and I are both educated, successful adults and we were treated like crackheads that deserved to get their baby taken away. Nurse Lisa was the absolute worst. I literally cried the few times she was our nurse. I understand that this hospital isn't in the best neighborhood and I can't imagine some of the things that these nurses have seen BUT they can't treat everyone like criminals. My baby and I were drug tested 5 different times. Which is fine, of course, do what you have to do. BUT DO NOT, come waltzing into my room after the last one and exclaim ""Guess what your test came back negative!!!"" My husband looked at Nurse Lisa and told her that it wasn't a surprise. Before that incident, I was in the middle of asking her if she was going to check the baby""s Blilirubin saying ""Are you guys going to...."" Nurse Lisa cut me off saying, ""What? Call CPS?"" We were like what are you saying? Again, educated, succesful adults. No absolute reason to treat us like that. Maybe it was because of the type of insurance I had but even that is no excuse. 

My husband and I ended up running out of the small amount of generic baby wipes the hospital gave us. When we informed Nurse Lisa that we were out of wipes she instructed us to clean up our baby's meconium up with PAPER TOWELS. 

If you or someone you know if thinking about delivering here, please think twice! Don't let this hospital ruin what is supposed to be the most sacred and amazing time of your lives. If for some strange reason you must have your baby here request a different nurse instead of Nurse Danielle and/or Nurse Lisa.

Edited to add: As a result of my experience at Phoenix Baptist, I developed PTSD and had extreme anxiety attacks from the moment I found out I was pregnant with my second, to the moment I left the hospital with a baby in my arms.",1

Also, I have brought my girlfriend here twice in a row (seeing as its closest to home), we knew what was wrong with her, but the doctor sent her home both times on FALSE ACCUSATIONS. Here I am once again at 6am on a work weekday. Never again will I return to that hospital. I'd rather drive 30min than the 6min it takes to get there.",1

Not none of the signs state exactly where out patient services are.   The building that houses this department external signs lack easy quick viewing.  There are so many signs stating that the OB/GYN is in  the same building you do not key into the smaller lettered sign stating out patient services is in the same building.  If you go into this building from the north side entrance there is NO INTERNAL sign sating where the registration area is.  The first sign you see is OUT PATIENT SERVICES 2nd floor at the elevator.  The registration area is marked by a recessed sign not visible unless you walk further in to the lobby,  One would think a sign with an arrow would be set up in a central area.
Now do not even attempt to correct a recovery room nurse about how long of a time frame you were told because they will snap at you rudely correcting you.  Gee one would think would not be lacking in customer services abilities.   I will try to never use Phoenix Baptist Hospital ever again.",1

A pair of scissors fell off the counter and punctured the top of my foot. I was dropped off at the hospital and I was bleeding really bad, like bleeding through my wrap and my foot was covered in blood. I was hopping on one foot to get to the desk and they just watched me. There was no one else that they were helping so I felt like they should have got off their a** and brought me a wheelchair. I even asked for a wheelchair and they still didn't bring me one. They gave me paperwork to fill out and I had to hop back and forth to the desk to fill it out and then bring it back.  As I waited with the 2 other people in the emergency room I started losing feeling in my foot.  I once again hopped back up there and told them that I couldn't feel my foot and up through my shin. I asked them if I should be concerned by this and they just stared at me like I was interrupting their conversation about them hating their job.  I then started experiencing terrible pain which seems odd when the foot is numb but it happened. When they called my name I told them that I couldn't hop anymore across the lobby in my flip flops, plus the hopping made my hemorrhaging foot hurt worse.  The lady actually rolled her eyes and had uptight body language while she was trying to help me get in the chair. When they took my blood pressure I once again expressed the concern about my numb, yet in pain foot and she didn't even respond. I was finally wheeled back to the Dr and the Dr said she would give me something for the pain. They did give me a tetanus shot and to my surprise brought me my discharge papers. I refused to sign them until they cleaned the wound. I had to ask them to wash all of the blood off of my foot and I asked if they were going to bandage it up. The guy walked out not saying a word and came back in with a band aid, stuck it on and walked out.  He then returned with discharge papers again and a script for some pain pills. I asked him how I was going to fill that at 12am because I had a foot that I couldn't drive with. He told me ""at a 24 hour pharmacy."" Duh! My point being that my foot was numb but in terrible pain, still bloody and he expected me to hunt down a pharmacy? He finally brought me a pain pill to get me through the night and I never did have to fill that script he gave me because by morning I had lost all feeling. This happened in April, it is now October and I STILL have no feeling. When I read my home care instructions the paper totally said that its a concern if I experience any numbness with a puncture wound and to inform them.  

Not to mention, I was sharing a room with a lady that had bronchitis and when she was taking her breathing treatment the tube kept popping off of the oxygen because they had it set too high.  She kept yelling for help because of this and she couldn't breathe but they ignored her... We were both pressing the nurse button and they just kept talking and laughing out in the hall. I even had to yell out to them so they would come and help her. They seemed so irritated that they had to come get this lady's breathing treatment squared away once more. God forbid anyone in the emergency room actually need help. This is absolutely the worst of the worst for hospitals. Honestly, whether you have to drive further to a different hospital or go to this one... You are still risking your life but I bet you would have better chances elsewhere.",1

They often seem scattered and unorganized...they will put you on hold with out saying a word, and the operator does not have a list of hospital staff or a hospital directory so they are unable to perform the transfer duty they are there to perform in the first place. Even if you give the operator the name of the person/employee you are looking for they have no way of transfer. I personally thought that's what an operator does.

Small individual rooms with semi comfortable transfer beds. All but one ER nurse I've had were professional & caring. Nurse Ratchet accused me of drug seeking. I told the ER doctor she was a dick & he told her to go away. 

On my third visit I got upgraded to a 5 day resident due to that allergy I mentioned at the beginning. This is where this place shines. All rooms are single rooms with comfy beds. They have TV's(not the best selection of stations) & some rooms have a radio. Most rooms have Internet for Laptops. The food is really good for a hospital(as long as your not on a special diet) & they have everything from breakfast burritos to a steak.

My wife and I just returned from having our baby delivered at Banner Estrella.  

Delivery doctors and nurses communicated well and were open throughout the surgery.  Baby was born healthy and they followed our baby plan.  Transition to the maternity ward went swimmingly and it was hard not to be impressed by the strong processes in place-- shift changes, confirming med times, checking in on baby and mother, taking diagnostics, ensuring I was with our baby when the work had to be done outside of the room.  Post-op comments on the doctor's work on my wife was positive from multiple docs.  Heck, even the food at the cafeteria was good.

Do wish the maternity ward rooms were more hospitable for significant others.  For example, a more comfortable bed (or even king-sized family bed), fridge, and bathroom space for a few toiletries would have made it about perfect.  The surgery area is starting to show its age and is a bit cramped.  Other than that, the staff was excellent all around.  

Bottom line: Impressive experience because of a truly wonderful medical staff.  And the new wing will be a great addition for the maternity ward come 2015.  We were bumped twice because of a mass of deliveries.  Still worked out superbly.",5

They want my pay stubs, income tax info etc... I can do that. I am more than willing to prove my income. But they still threaten me.

We went to the Banner Estrella ER at about 1 a.m.  While the wait time wasn't long, I was literally on the verge of passing out and all they did for me was to plunk me in a wheelchair and sit m next to one of the banks of chairs.  There were only 4 other people there, so it did not look overly busy.

They took us back into a room that only had an examination table and took more information.  The nurse told me we each had a $200 copay.  I told her I left the house without a way to pay.  She kind of huffed at me and said curtly ""Well I am going to note in your file that you did not have the means to pay today"".  That was the LAST think I was worried about.  I felt like we were both dying.

They took us back to another type of waiting room, which had about 25 chairs, hooks on the wall, garbage on the floor and used blankets on the chairs.  They hooked us both to IV's and left us sit there, extremely uncomfortable.  Where the heck are the beds, or something to lean back in?  As a person who feels like they are dying from the flu, the last thing I want to do is sit up.  We were given thin blankets to cover ourselves with an puke buckets.

I will not use this ER again.  It's apples and oranges compared to the Mayo ER.  I have never gone to an ER where they didn't give you a place to lay down.  Once again, I have nothing against the staff - it was the way we were treated physically and the garbage laying around this ER treatment room.

I've worked in different hospitals all my adult years. 

The triage and L&D nurses were awesome.  I'd give them 5 stars!!!!  Very polite, and caring. They were always checking in on me. Made sure I was comfortable. Helped with with everything my husband and I needed during the labor process. Couldn't have asked for better staff. 

The postpartum nurses and techs on the other hand, not so good.
 They put me in the wrong room. When we had to switch rooms, they didn't even help my husband move our things. There was my husband pushing the baby in the bassinet and carrying all our bags and supplies.  There was more than one tech and my nurse. There was no reason one of them couldn't help. 

The nurses hardly ever came in.  I had to ask way in advance for supplies, because no one would come after calling the nurses station.   I'd ask for an ice pack and after and hour or so, I'd have to go look outside my room for someone to ask. The nurses were all on their phones texting away at the nurses station.   Now I know why their techs were so busy.   There was construction and we were in a room with a window. The room must have been right in front of where the construction crew took their lunch breaks. I'd have to cover up while nursing my baby, because I could see the crew through the gaps in the blinds!  When leaving my husband had to ask the tech to get a wheel chair, which they are supposed to do anyway. For whatever reason, she was expecting me to walk and carry the baby in the car seat, all the way to my car.   I felt the staff was very lazy.

The hospital was dirty and run down.  I know hospitals are dirty, but this was the worst I've stayed in.   My socks were black.  The bathroom floor was disgusting. The environmental people cleaned the shower floor with the same pad they cleaned my entire room with.   They didn't have any sani-cloths to wipe down the toilet and sink surfaces. I'm not sure if it's because they're afraid patients will clean their child with them or what.

The nurses and my resident and even my surgeon personally greeted me and checked on me while I was waiting patiently in pain. 

My only feedback would be for the admitting E.R. staff to check the patient's IDs as mine was not checked. In a day of identity theft, this is an extremely important step.

I've been in pain while these uneducated, lazy, and inconsiderate individuals watch me suffer and cry from pain. I've called the nurse three times for pain reliever. It wasn't until I started complaining that I got the attention of not only one nurse, but 3 and a doctor. I asked why no one had come to let me know what was going on or to at least give me an update and he said ""well sorry"". What kind of medical doctor goes to school for 10 years and promises to help his patients but then turns them away because of a few F Bombs. Treat me with respect and maybe you would have received the same treatment. I might understand if the hospital was busy, but once again, I was the only patient on my floor and had 4 nurses listen to me complain and not get me temporary pain reliever! Worst hospital ever. They treat you like nothing, and only care about drugging you up to get you out. Courtesy of Obama Care and the lazy, useless, unprofessional, disrespectful members that follow him. I'm sure Benjamin Franklin would be ashamed that we couldn't keep the republic to which we declared. And so communism begins.....",1

It's new, it's modern, it's clean it's trendy and there aren't a lot of ""them"" hanging around here like other major hospitals.

We arrived at 9:55pm and she told me that since 2 other people arrived just before me, I was not allowed to sign in.  She instructed us to go to the ER at the hospital!  
My child had severe pneumonia and possibly needed oxygen and our information and x-rays were already in Cornerstone's computer system...and Rebecca still wouldn't let my child be seen?  I believe that all they care about is getting out of there as fast as possible...forget taking people before closing time.",1

It was Friday and her regular Dr. was booked up.  Angela said there was no Pinkeye but she had pus in her ears and had a minor ear infection so she prescribed antibiotics, amoxicilon I think.  The only hitch was when the baby had her regular dr appointment the next week he said there was no infection so we were left to wonder who was right.",3

So for small minor things that just need a quick check and antibiotics, it's fine.  I went in bc I suspected my daughter was dehydrated from diarrhea but wasn't ready to pull my husband out of work and brave the ER bc my baby, although miserable, was not yet lethargic.  I wanted to have them confirm or deny my suspicians so I could go from there.   As usual the receptionist was nice and we were taken back promptly.  Then the Dr came in.  I have not seen her there before.  This woman makes sour look sweet.  She was probably 40's or 50's and was nasty the whole time.  She snapped at my 4 yr old that was with me bc she was simply trying to talk to her and be friendly, she also made me feel like a horrible mother to the point that I was bawling bc she told me I waited too long to get it taken care of (see later notes, she was wrong).  She finally left and sent a nurse in to take a blood sample.  The nurse was so sweet, but the sampling was a complete disaster.  There was blood everywhere but in the vial after at least 10 min of trying.  She had to stop to wipe off her own hands and my screaming baby's hands several times bc there was so much blood everywhere.  She finally decided that it was enough and left.  I had blood all over my hands, my baby had blood all over her hands, there was even blood on the floor.  I actually cleaned all this up myself.  In the end there wasn't enough blood in the vial to do the test so I had to go to the ER anyway since I wasn't willing to let them do the test again.  So I spent a heartbreaking hour there with zero progress essentially.  It turned out at the ER that my baby was only mildly dehydrated so there was no need for that awful woman to make me feel like a bad mom, the ER probably would have turned me away if I had come in the day before bc she didn't need the IV yet.  Anyway so I fumed over this visit for a day and then called and left a message for the manager.  She called me back within a day and I recounted what happened.  She actually was very sweet, and was shocked and horrified at what happened.  She refunded my co-pay and assured me the nurse would get more training, and that she would talk to the owners.  In the end despite the horrible experience I think she did all she could.  I still think the Dr was awful, and they could have easily done the test on  a litmus type paper like they did at the hospital with almost no hassle at all so obviously that needs to change too.  The Dr's I have seen there in the past were all nice, so I don't know why what the deal is with this latest Dr.",2

Christy came in and asked what was going on & I explained everything to her.  She left the room to order X-rays & said the tech would be in soon to get my son. Then Dr. Banerjee came in 2 mins later and was totally rude!! She told me my son wasn't limping & it was all in my head & his finger wasn't broken, but she'd X-ray it to prove it to me. She came in with no X-rays in her hand, said it was totally fine & he'd be swollen for 4-7 weeks, walked out & said we were ok to go. No walk out papers, nothing.

CONS:  * They don't stay open late.  * The exam rooms could be better decorated for, anything would be an improvement.

It is near our house and very convenient when our doctor isn't available. I have ever had a bad experience since this last time. My daughter developed a lump on her throat and I became very concerned. This is the urgent care my doctos office refers to so obviously I rushed there. The nurse that brought us back was not welcoming to me our my 4 year old daughter by any means which was such a surprise to me. The staff has always been so welcoming, kind and patient with us.  We were seen very quickly by a doctor that was overly baby talking my very well spoken 4 year old. After the examination she told us my vaccinated daughter had mumps! She had another colleague come in and examine my daughter. Afterwards I could hear them arguing about the prognosis. We left with no tests and no real answers to what could be going on with my child. The diagnosis didn't sit right with me so I called my doctors and they told me to go to a different urgent care and told me that she called this establishment and in not exact words ""chewed out"" the doctor that gave this diagnosis. My daughter has been in 2 urgent cares and and ER in the last 48 hours because of the ignorance of one doctor. She should be paying my medical bills. I used to recommend this Urgent Care to all my friends and now I'm not sure what happened here in the name change and take over but this momma is not happy!!!!",1

I said no an was instructed to sign in and take a form (there was a slew of clipboards with new patient paperwork on the counter). We filled out the paper work and was told there was a copay. We don't have a copay... She insisted it was 20. After telling her I don't have my card she set her book down and very annoyed told me to take my son to the er than because they weren't going to see him.

We also have had xrays done to make sure a toddler sized pinky wasn't broken. The waiting room is a bit drab, the crowd is mixed, and you'll see people in their pajamas. But, it is worth the 25min drive, passing urgent cares in the way, to see a pediatrician.",4

While I don't like hospitals very much, this one was at least bearable. As I stated before, I've been to others in the valley (prior to this one opening) and I'll never go to any of those again (unless I'm unconscious, then I really won't have a choice, will I).",5

The second time I was in the Mercy ER was after a car accident and I was brought by ambulance. The staff that met my ambulance team was excellent and I was quickly evaluated and given a room where my family could wait with me while x-rays, tests, etc were conducted. They even had a therapy dog visiting that night and it was very nice to be able to sit with him while I was being patched up and helped me feel not quite so shaky and panicky about what had just happened. (Hit by another driver who ran a light, car was totalled). My entire visit was very smooth and I felt like everyone in the ER knew their roles and what they needed to do. I also had to get my medical records after the accident for my attorneys and their records department was very friendly and helpful and it was very quick and easy to get my records and also to have them sent to my orthopedic surgeon. I hope I never have to go to the ER again but I would definitely recommend Mercy Gilbert.",4
587653,IafRikQAWQmJa3Bi-jUPFA,bWThH-ZMCxmHzdqLbcp66Q,"I was checked into here in September of 2010. I was extremely ill and disoriented, and I was made to wait in the ER waiting room for 4 hours. After 3 hours, they actually hooked me up to an IV in the waiting room area with patients around me, so everyone coming in got to stare at me. This, to me, was unacceptable. 

The worse of the problems was the billing statement. Mercy Gilbert has been asked several time by both me and my insurance company to forward a complete bill to my insurance. My insurance agency says that I am covered. I receive bills every couple months, and they are all for the full amount, with $0 paid by insurance. This was nearly a year ago, and low and behold I received another bill with the full balance yesterday. I called my insurance (who has always been wonderful) and they said they STILL had not received information- this was the 6th time we have had to ask them for it. I called them today and was promised they would send it over, again. It's a never ending circle, and I will NEVER go back.",1
587654,Wj3Fw9iTz4qGFKWM4EWvWQ,bWThH-ZMCxmHzdqLbcp66Q,"Worst experience ever !!  Went in for food poisoning, their process is just bizarre.  I was about 4th or 5th in line and it took 30 minutes to check in, then you have to wait again to be taken to the back.  Then they tell you to go out front, then you go back again to get checked out.  I passed out on one of their couches cuz I was in so much pain.  By the time I went back into a room it was 3 hours later.  I was back their for another 3 hours mostly waiting.  Nurses continued to walk pass me an hour after my I.V. was out.  

So my bill was $12 grand, and I didn't have surgery lol  I had an x-ray, they gave me morphine which I don't know why, and the I.V. to hydrate me which I liked.  I called them and asked why the hell was it so much, my insurance covered $10,500 so I owe $1,500.  So they are going to send me an itemized statement.  Why they don't send this in the first place is beyond me.  I really think my insurance company and hospital collaborated with the amount my insurance company (BCBS) can get something back under the table.  A few weeks later I received anothe payment I owe to the Physican, which is a grand more, thanks!!

The staff was very competent and friendly.  They really went out of their way to make us feel comfortable, both of us.  The rooms are spacious and comfortable and have a wide variety of TV channels and even movies.  You can also watch educational videos on the TVs as well.  Like short videos on breast feeding and child care.  Even after the birth you have a private room with a couch that converts into an uncomfortable bed for dad. Mom's bed is, of course, comfortable.
The best part though is the staff, they respond quickly to your call and never seem impatient, even if you called over something stupid.  Like say, your baby sneezing, which is apparently totally normal.  Our baby was admitted longer than mom but they let us stay in the room to be with her.  They warned us ""no meds and meals"" for mom since she wasn't technically admitted.  Which is fair.  To make up for it they gave us a $5 gift card to the cafeteria, which was really sweet.  A quick aside, the cafeteria has pretty decent food for a SUPER fair price.  Anyway, they ended up bringing her a tray anyway, even after the gift card.

My husband took his 80 yr old mother in for the second time due to a severe back condition that is in the process of diagnosis.  After two days of not sleeping and being crumpled on the floor my husband took her back to the ER for help and to ask for an MRI.  They told her flat out no and asked him why they were there in the first place.  The Dr. was extremely rude and condescending.  The nurse admitted to insurance red tape and the reason for not allowing the MRI...They were there for 6 hours and she left with a morphine injection.  Terrible terrible place!

587658,Kwbhma8j-Unom-rAGgznRA,bWThH-ZMCxmHzdqLbcp66Q,"I'm writing this review as a way of thanking everyone for the superb care that I received during my recent hospital stay. This was my 23 surgery and I've been hospitalized in some of the countries best medical facilities, including Mayo Clinic and John Hopkins but Mercy Gilbert Medical Center was by far the best experience to date. My way of recognizing and thanking them is by writing this review in recognition of their superb care. I am in no way affiliated with this hospital just a very pleased patient.

I have a rare joint disease called PVNS which required surgical removal of a benign tumor in my knee. My journey began as an out-patient, however, once the PVNS was confirmed they had to switch to an open synovectomy which required an in-patient hospital stay. 

I was very impressed upon our arrival at the hospital for it felt like we were walking into a five star health spa. The hospital was serving a holiday meal for employees and visitors and the aroma of home cooked foodfilled the spacious multilevel golden domed entry. Who cares if I haven't been able to eat for the last 14 hours. The hospital is carpeted and beautifully decorated with garland and colorful decorations wrapped around the handrails of each level.

We journeyed up to the second floor and checked into the Out Patient Surgery Unit. We arrived two hours early... which is the customary time to enroll in the hurry up and wait to get sliced and diced game. As I looked around the elaborately decorated waiting room...I noticed some of the amenities that I was gladly paying extra for. They have a dedicated flat screen that is updated every minute to notify the families where the surgical patients are at all times in the process (pt is identified by a number).

""Mrs Jeffrey, I'm going to be your nurse please follow me and we'll get you all set up for your surgery."" My eyes kept darting around pre-op in amazement, We need to start an IV, however you look like a difficult stick so I'm going to call a technician in to use the ultrasound machine to visualize our vein, no worries she will inject an anesthetic to decrease the amount of discomfort that you may feel while we start the IV. Man I was just thinking ""I love any place that cares about how much pain I may feel from a needle stick. They must be really good in managing surgical pain."" If you'd like we can give you a femoral nerve block so you don't feel the surgical pain for 24-48 hours. ""Oh hell yes I want that too."" I was definitely being pampered by all who crossed my path.

I was even given a pretty purple marker to keep as a souvenir after my surgeon and I marked my surgical site together. Oops, I guess no funny stuff is supposed to be written on your surgical sight.The surgeon showed me a pain scalechartand asked what level of pain would be acceptable after surgery. I may beblondbut I can spot a trick question. ""Zero!! would be the most acceptable. I just figured if this place was giving me an option, I didn't want to feel any pain. Hells yes, I'll pay extra for that.

My husband was givena pager with a read out in the center that would say for example ""surgery is going well, surgery is almost over, patient is in recovery"" allowing them to explore the the healing gardens and fountains on the hospital campus while I was having surgery.Timeto say good bye to my sweetheart and be ushered off to the O.R. Just when I thought every possible comfort was being given I suddenly feel a warm fuzzy surge of happy juice flowing through my body...whoosh nightie night.

I awoke in a quiet, very comfortable room filled with state of the art equipment, a couch that transformed into a guest bed, computer for staff use, scanner used for patient safety and tracking of supplies, interactive tv which provided my personally assigned education videos, review questionnaire, relaxation videos, cable, movies, games, internet access with a wireless keyboard, a service ordering menu which included the Paws for Pets program (therapy pets) fully equipped with all of the amenities that a VIP would expect, however, I wasn't a VIP.  The view out the window was amazing where I could see the snow capped mountains, palms and even the fall colors of the trees. My view overlooked the entrance of the hospital displaying beautifully chiseled fountains in a zen like healing garden, a life sized metal tree and overflowing elevated ponds. At night it was beautifully illuminated.

Most important was the exceptional care that I received from every member of the staff...doctors, nurses, CNA's, laboratory personnel, dietary, PT, OT and the housekeeping staff. Everyone represented their profession in the best way possible. Due to distant my husband was unable to visit so it was vitally important that I felt safe and well cared for. Everyone exceeded my expectations.",5

Our three year old daughter was brought by ambulance to this ER, and the staff had NO idea how to care for a child.  She was not in shock and not crying or fighting, but they were not able to get a proper temp or urine sample,  without MY help and suggestions. They took her blood pressure with a large adult sized cuff, and no one even checked her ears to realize she had a terrible infection. Worse, the ""STAT/emergency"" blood and urine tests were sent out of the facility to take TWO days to return.  On top of this, the doctor was RUDE and seemed clueless as what to do. (Her name was Dr. Kent) Completely unacceptable.  We immediately drove our daughter to a different facility as soon as she was able to leave, and then she was FINALLY cared for after hours of waiting and not getting proper care.  What a JOKE. 
A year ago a family member was sent here after an accident and the ER was even worse.  And, my mother needed surgery and her doctor told her there was no way he would perform it at Mercy Gilbert, even though he has privileges there because the staff is that bad.

My ankle was dislocated and my leg was broken in two places! I was admitted quickly. Every single staff member I came in contact with went out of his/her way to make sure I was given the best care, considering the circumstances. I have love in my heart for the staff, as this was the worst day of my life, and they went out of their way to make sure I was informed, reassured, cared for, comfortable, etc...

While she lay suffering, the nurses were loudly discussing their weekend plans without any regard for her.  ""I'm going out with Josh tonight!""  ""I've been checking flights for my trip.""  

When I requested a cup of water for my friend, they told me no and instructed me to get back behind the curtain.

This went on for an hour and these nurses couldn't have cared any less.  

I was further shocked when the hospital's Director of Customer Experience told me that the hospital is known for pain management.  I almost laughed out loud.

The ER Doc examine his wound FOUR times over the next 8 hours sticking her hand into the open bleeding wounds.  This was accentuated by her totally careless approach to his care while she callously ignored our repeated complaints.  The last time she stuck her fingers into the wound my son and I called Banner Good Sam and had him transported by ambulance to the hospital 57 miles away in Phoenix.  He was in surgery in 45 minutes on arrival for a 3 hour operation to repair the damage and close the wounds.  It took 125 stitches.  What kind of ER allows a man obviously in horrible trauma to lay for 8 hours in the ER giving the family of that patient this much grief?  The nurses are just above the doctor and held him up from transport for 45 minutes ""to do the paperwork"" we had requested two hours earlier.   I complained to the Head of the hospital and was told ""WE DID NOTHING WRONG.""  They closed the case.  You decide if you want your loved one treated like this.

I received a call from my physician asking me to come to Mercy Gilbert where she was on call over the weekend so that we could take a closer look at the wound.  Dr Jennifer Reitz of Advanced Surgical promised me a direct admit to the hospital --on the way there we received a call from the call center stating I would have to go through the ER.  I arrived in the ER and was taken back - before vitals or anything else was done I was informed by the RN that I was being placed on a Psych hold because I had made statements that I planned to kill myself.  I immediately went to run - they called security who came in and tackled me dragging my open wound across the floor and then used my face to clear a supply rack.  I was then thrown in a gurney and halled down the hallway and told I would have to take any clothes off that were mine and be in there clothes.  They would not even let me keep my underwear.  I never told a doctor that I wanted to kill myself - their notes specifically state that I did not say this.  This all came about based on a conversation with a home health nurse I was trying to fire because she was not tending to my pain and Dr Jennifer Reitz who then turned around and put words into my husband's mouth to justify this.  I was told that I would be held at the hospital overnight and could not leave AMA - the only other option was going to jail. Eventually I was placed in a room, had all my belongings taken away and thrown into their med-surg floor where the nurse laughed all night at me,  Finally the psych douche bag shows up and agrees that what I had said 12 hours earlier was true...I was not suicidal.  However, in order to not be sent for inpatient psych eval I had to agree to work with the surgeon who lied to me and allow her to do another surgery.  I now truly fear this facility...their is no human kindness involved here.  This ER wanted someone to beat on and I was that person.  I now have severe PTSD and do not trust anyone in the medical field to touch me.  Do yourself a favor...if you have an issue that requires the ER avoid this one.  Not only did they do nothing for my wound pain -  they have left me with severe PTSD and nightmares.  The place needs to be closed and everyone that works there needs their license taken away from them without an option of ever being able to get it back.",1

She really helped me through the epidural process which was one of the scariest parts for me. I was having stronger contractions at that time so it was hard to stay still but she helped me through it. The anesthesiologist did an amazing job...no pain and I was in heaven after that! My labor went into shift change and Susan was now my nurse. Wow I can't say I've ever had a better nurse! She checked on me every 10-15 mins or it felt that way. She was so attentive and always made sure I was doing okay. When it came time to deliver she was amazing!! She was my biggest cheerleader.

I recently took my 5 year old in to the ER and was appalled by the treatment from the physician Kristen Osiecki to both me and my daughter.

She was completely inappropriate with how she restrained my daughter to try and force a medication down her that she didn't even need! Then proceeded to yell at me AND my daughter.   I made a complaint and the incidence was investigated and was unfortunately shocked when I received the letter with the results of the investigation.  Not only did the physician lie about the incident and her reasons to justify her actions, they made me out to be the uncooperative mother with a defiant child.  Thank God my daughter was not hurt by the physical man-handling of my daughter but NEVER again will I trust this emergency department with any of my family's care.

587674,qnVth-_rg0bnOjiKVevTVg,bWThH-ZMCxmHzdqLbcp66Q,"Let me start by saying that I have never written a review for any hospital ever.  As a former Critical Care nurse  I take patient treatment very seriously.  Yesterday afternoon I had an unfortunate accident of falling off of a 3 foot high solid wood bar stool while hanging a photo:(   I fell flat on my back onto the solid wood pottery barn stool breaking the stool into several pieces.  Immediately my right arm and leg went numb and tingly and the pain was the worst excrutiating radiating pain I have experienced.  I was shreiking at the top of my lungs from the pain.  Luckily my husband was in the room and saw it happen.  He lay me flat on the floor and because of the pain we thought I had definitely broken my back.  I have never called 911 or had the opportunity for ambulance transport in my life. The Gilbert paramedics from Germann/Lindsey were exceptional.  They started an IV controlled my pain and looked at my back.  They asked where I wanted to go and I hadn't hear any reviews regarding GMMC but it was the closest ER. The worst care ever hands down in my life.  Chris RN seemed distracted and completely put out that i was there.  Even after pain med from the paramedics my pain continued to be excrutiating. Dr. Nolan (triage MD) came in touched my toes and left.  Never looked at my back, hip, etc.  She slightly pressed on my abdomen and said xray ct and left.  I told Chris RN my pain was over a 10 and he came back in 15 minutes later with Toradol (basically Motrin).  This didn't help even a little.  As I cried in intense pain over the next 30 minutes my husband got Chris's attention and asked him to help.  He said Dr. Nolan was the triage doctor and he would get another Dr. to ask for pain med. A gentleman with red hair and a badge that said Contractor came in and asked me a few questions.  My husband had to leave while we waited for the CT to go home and check on our children (we have a special needs son).  While he was gone as I lay in excrutiating pain I got to listen to the nurses station party it up. Wes watched and listened to the preakness from his computer at the station, he was actually watching tv with an ER full of patients.  He went on and on about who won what.  Also, one of the ER techs was talking about ""cabeza de chorlito"".  I guess he didn't think I spoke spanish, it means scatterbrain.  Dr. Barrell the new physician RN Chris called, came in and touched my toes and again never looked at my back or hip, however, I was allowed 6mg of Morphine for pain. I couldn't get Chris's attention and so a female nurse put me on a bedpan where I sat for 20 mins until I slipped it out myself and it sat on the end of the gurney.  My husband returned and I mentioned to him just how awful it was while he was gone.  Thank heavens the xray and CT were negative for a break.  I left immediately after the results as the care was so bad.  I shuffled over to the bathroom with the help of my husband and Chris my nurse didn't even know.  Dr. Barrell came in and told me their was about 10 min of paperwork to do and what pain med did I usually take (I don't take pain med regularly and didn't really understand his question).  I said whatever he though would stop the back spasms.  I left with instructions for ice and hydrocodone).  My IV was empty backing up with blood into the tubing and my nurse checked on my maybe twice in 3 1/2 hrs.  Not one person looked at my back or hip while I was there.  How can they even evaluate my accident?  I woke up this morning with a huge hematoma about the size of an orange on my lower right back, a fist sized hematoma on my hip and a 5 inch bruise on my left buttock.  The pain is very bad still today.  It just occurred to me as I spoke to a nurse friend of mine that the ER people must have thought i was a ""drug seeker.""  I can't imagine why else they would have treated my so rudely. Never listened to my heart, lungs, or the part of my body that was hurt.  I will never, ever return here for any care and would recommend that others drive a few minutes further for quality care. I haven't been out of nursing that long but I could have gone to the grocery store and received a better workup.",1

Specifically, Dr Christopher Lipinski, possibly the rudest, most arrogant, brash, condescending, abrasive, uncaring ER physician---or for that matter---ANY physician I've ever had the misfortune of meeting.  His bedside manners leave much to be desired.  Is he a doctor or an obnoxious frat boy dressed like one?  Does he care one iota about the patient or does he think he's doing you a favor by being in the same room with you?

I live in Los Angeles, and since the Mayo Clinic in Rochester had been such a incredible institution we mad the grave error of going to the one in Phoenix which carries the Mayo name. Alas, it has no resemblencte to the one in Rochester.

The Phoenix Mayo, is an ordinary, money making corporate institution, which has forgotten the principles on what the Mayo brothers had founded the hospital originally and is a slick organization.

Yes, there was one lady by the name of Tate Henry, who was kind and attentive however, when it came to billing  department,I do believe that the Mayo in Phoenix is completely mercenary. Mrs. Henry was powerless.

I have medicare and supplemental insurance. Blue cross clearly stated that they would be willing to pay provided that the coding was corrected. Which basically meant that I did not go for a regular, nor preventive care. That the fact was I had no balance and was in a wheel chair, being taken in by Mrs. Henry and that the doctor in Phoenix Mayo who saw me wanted to rule out that I had suffered a stroke, etc. did not seem to matter.

Blue cross stayed on the conference call to Mayo and explained that because of their coding, Medicare had refused to pay, thus making Blue cross unable to pay. Yes, the onus fell on me. Nearly a year into this Mayo Phoenix will not correct the billing, thus making my providers unable to pay and insisting that I pay.

The decency of Medicare through all this has been incredible. Every time, that I have called, they have actually taken an interest in the human being and are trying to do something.

Mayo Phoenix will not. Please make sure that if you are considering the Mayo Clinic avoid the Phoenix name only institution. They have none of the principles of the Rochester. They are interested in making money. They are unclear at the start, and basically are a less then an honorable institution.

I wanted to let others, who like me, may consider the Phoenix institution because of proximity must avoid them at all costs. They have nothing in common with the Rochester Mayo. Having one good person in a institution does not mean that that you will not be tossed aside when it comes to money and looking and hiding behind implementing errors. Yes, they say they are obeying the rules. That is what they said while marching human beings to the gas chamber.",1

I spent way too much time there last year, and their dedication is the only reason I am able to write this now.  I had amazing surgery unavailable here and several followup visits.  I learned how easy it was to take the SuperShuttle from Sky Harbor to the Marriott on the grounds of the Hospital and then in my off hours, use the Marriott shuttle to get around Scottsdale shopping.  i was very sad when my primary relocated to Seattle as I discovered I really like Arizona and will miss the staff at MCH very much.  I literally owe them my life.  

I am not sure why people are complaining about the price - my insurance coverage was the same as here at home but you have the benefit of the Mayo experience.  The doctors are not motivated by personal gain since I found out they are on SALARY - not commissions and kickbacks.  Example:  I was not over-radiated because my doctor needed two more scans to get that condo in Aruba for a week, etc.

593027,0-Yxw2ULgyAbeE_D3BmpBQ,hkYPNU-KYa3nJzqGuAQL_g,"I've had the pleasure of using this facilty since it was built, and had I rated it on any of my past visits, it would have gotten 5 stars like many of the reviews you'll find here.
Unfortunately, this is not the same Mayo Hospital as 2010 or earlier.
Mayo, like every other business entity in today's economic environment is now demonstrating a particular focus on bottom line rather than patient care. I experienced this first hand last week during a two day procedure.
Inquisitive, I asked several staff members what was going on, since the level of service had deteriorated so noticeably. I got the same response from nearly all I spoke with. 
Mayo, in its efforts to fill all the beds has now started accepting most insurances, (a concept they turned their nose up at in the past) the result of which is an overly crowded hospital. 
Due to the nature of my procedure, I was to stay overnight. I stayed overnight, but in a holding area instead of a room. Again, the nurses informed me there were simply no rooms available. 
The result.
Both my wife and my doctor were unable to locate me. 
The nurses were not helpful and willfully disregarded the printed instructions given to my wife at check-in, (stating visiting procedures post-op).
After several (4) hours of my frantic spouse trying to locate me, she finally was told she could not see me due to my not being accessible.
My doctor was unable to locate me until 5 hours after the surgery at which time he blew up at the staff, (in my presence) informing them a room was necessary due to the extensive neurological testing required the next morning and how this could not be performed in a holding area. 
The next day when I did come around, I found a nice bump on my head along with a nice cut on my face. I informed the nurse on duty but she deferred to the patient care rep who blew it off as a routine condition that regularly occurs in surgery, telling me the surgery table was cold and my head likely stuck to it. (like that explains the goose egg and cut)

The doctor was the best. The nursing staff was also top notch. It was the overcrowding, the panic they managed to instill in my family by not keeping them informed post operatively, and the dumb as hell patient rep whose ardent defense of the hospital only made her look stupid, and me contemptuous.

The Mayo has always been a top notch facility, but this visit proved anything but. 
When you charge the prices the Mayo does, there's no excuse for the troubles we experienced.
I, like the other reviewers, routinely recommended the Mayo as being the standard in ultimate patient care.
Not anymore.
I could have gotten this level of disappointment at the County Hospital.",1

I've had reason to visit the emergency room here and was quickly admitted for surgery the next day. The quality of medical attention and knowledge of the dr.s is just the best. Contrarily, the really pretty, young, blond nurse who works on the floor i stayed on overnight was a masochistic control freak who argued with me and delivered only half doses of pain meds (not okay in this situation). I was in pain under her watch and she acted as if i were a whiney drug seeker. REALLY MAD AT HER. 
The emergency room on another visit was not crowded but they didn't have a lot of people on staff at that time of night. I had to wait for hours for the ultrasound tech to arrive. Which, again, would've been okay if I had been given an effective dose of pain medication. Rather, they waited to confirm that my ovary had torsed twice and formed 2 blood pumpimg cysts which were on the verge of bursting. I know, it's gross. I was in the worst pain of my entire life and didn't have that effectively managed until they saw the situation from the inside. I'm not one to suffer in silence, there's no excuse for it when we have solutions. I think they do a great job, but are a little suspicious of people in pain. I don't know why you wouldn't be in some degree of pain in an emergency ward.",4

After a couple trips to various doctors, I took my MRI and CT scans to the Mayo Hospital, and made an appointment with the ENT department. 

Don't come here thinking you will get a nose job just because you are concerned with your appearance. This isn't Scottsdale surgical spa. It's funny because, in the lobby, there was a girl who complained about her crooked nose and claimed she had a deviated septum --just so she could get a nose job. She was pissed when the doc denied her. Awesome sauce.

In any case, the ENT department accurately went over my scans, and referred me to Neurology. As a TEAM, they came through with a treatment plan and helped solve my migraine issue. I didn't need surgery, even though some doctors suggested I should get it done.

I am a long time patient and have been very happy with the treatment I receive from Mayo. BUT, recently I had a problem and my doc was out of town. This time, the whole Mayo system failed me. Even after multiple attempts to talk to the doctor on call, no one returned my calls. In desperation, I went to their emergency department only to be treated like an errant school child by Dr. Ricky Arnold who did not contact the orthopedic department as I requested for their opinion. I hate to say it but Mayo has some big issues they need to look into. For me, the blush is off this rose for sure. 
After a very upset call to an afterhours receptionist, I did get to talk to the on call Orthopedic guy, Dr. Woods. This was after 2 full days of waiting for a call from their ""on-call"" backup for my doc. Dr. Woods was courteous and helpful. He answered my questions and attempted to do some recovery from the abominable service previously provided by the ortho department and Dr. Arnold. I am fine and my problem seems to be on the mend but is lucky I didn't really NEED care because it was non-existant.

I flew to Phoenix to help my father because my mother suffered a major stroke. Luckily she was just down the road from Mayo and received the care she needed. Not only did she live, but they also found other problems that may have played a role in the stroke. Overall I am very thankful to them for their care and ensuring that my mother had her needs met while admitted as a patient.

Pros:

1.  Plenty of parking for people to visit. Easy to find off the main highway (you want to take the 56th Street exit). Parking is free. Just don't park in labeled spots, you will get booted. 

2.  Top notch facility that bases their medical care upon current research. It's not just let's try this and that and see what happens, rather carefully planned treatment. Their neurosurgeon suggested a surgery for my mother (hemicraniectomy) as an option if her brain kept swelling but explained what it truly would do for her. She knew we had a right to know but definitely didn't seem to support the procedure. We decided against it because my mother was lucid during the conversation and was also against it. The surgeon also showed us the CT of my mother's brain and explained everything in simple terms for my father to understand what was happening. In general, I considered this the most important part of dealing with a crisis situation.

3.  Never thought I would say this but their lunch room is top notch. Great selection of food, labeled with nutritional information, and definitely tasty. Also, not break the bank prices. If I lived/worked in the area I would stop by here just for the lunch, that's how good it was to me. A very nice room to sit in with plenty of large windows and an outside eating area.

4.  Caring staff that was attentive to our needs. When I needed to talk to the social worker about the next steps they were very informative and friendly to us. They knew where to send my mother and made sure her belongings got there.

5.  They sent an itemized bill to my father so he would know the breakdown of everything done for my mother. For those of you that don't think insurance is important, a $120K bill will change your outlook.

Cons:

1.  None, I definitely approve of this place. Your health plan might be the issue for long-term care but I would definitely want to go here for my immediate and long term care.",5

620902,azbZU75ekeRYZPLTwU1UiA,d-S7YIbeKqUAuspIoOedmQ,"I had my son at Southern Hills hospital in November of 2011. My overall experience was alright. The majority of my nurses were terrible, and a few were excellent. Surprisingly, there was really no median. I wish I could remember their names. I am so thankful that my nurse that was there right before and during the actual arrival of my son was so helpful. If it wasnt for her, I would have had a c section for sure. She flipped my body from side to side every hour or so, to help me dialate. I had an epidural, so my legs were completely numb. I couldnt really help her move me...and she did all the work. She did everything in her power to avoid a c section, and the end result was a vaginal birth. My major complaint was that not one nurse told me how to care for my baby after he was born. I had no idea how much to feed him, how to burp him, how to breastfeed etc. Another nurse helped me breastfeed, she was great as well. One nurse gave my boyfriend the wrong vaccine when she gave us the pertessus vaccine. That was a horrible mistake! The floor manager came and apologized, but wow..that could have been bad! My son ended up having jaundice...and had to stay an extra night without me. I feel like he got jaundice from me not feeding him enough. I wish one of the nurses would have told me I wasnt feeding him enough, I had no idea.",3

I was told by my doctor to come in for pre op visit, and was given paper work with the orders for pre op blood work.  When I arrived, I was greeted right away and within a few minutes brought to the back.

On the morning of surgery, I arrived at the designated time and was quickly brought to the surgical center to be prepped.  My surgery went very well, I was in and out in just a few short hours.  During my stay, the staff was courteous, skilled and worked as a team.  It was refreshing to see them work well with each other.  

Overall a good experience, and would use this facility in the future.",4
620904,8-oixgdUSnZlX_sOVG1PZg,d-S7YIbeKqUAuspIoOedmQ,"While my review may be negative, I want to acknowledge the positives of Southern Hills Hospital. Because of the real estate crash, Southern Hills serves an underpopulated locale in Las Vegas. As a result, the facilities are clean and new, and the wait time for treatment never seems too long, at least for the emergency room.

However, it is difficult for me to recommend the hospital because of my ongoing experience with their treatment of my mom.

Before I go further, I want to make clear that I am not expecting any miracles from this hospital. My mom is 89 years old this year, and she is contending with some serious issues. All I want for her is professional attention and comfort; the majority of the staff at Southern Hills fails on both counts.

My mom was admitted two nights ago because of pneumonia. Three weeks ago she was diagnosed with the early stages of tuberculosis from the state health department (only the blood cultures were positive, the sputum tests were all negative). For precautionary reasons, she was given a solitary room on the ICU floor.

Although tuberculosis can only be contracted with consistent, unprotected exposure to the victim from three hours plus according to a doctor (Syed Shah) I consulted yesterday, the masked, sterilized nurses, treat my mom like they could catch the disease at any moment. During our stay, the nurses purposefully avoid my mom's room. To give you an example of how negligent these staff members were, the nurse this morning told me to take my mom's sputum sample because she said she wanted to go on her lunch break. I did this and she forgot to retrieve the sample and I had to deliver it myself outside.

Later on, the same nurse returned to my room and informed that she may have bronchitis. Although, as a medical professional, she should know that catching TB from my mom under such safe conditions is impossible, she said that she was only coughing in my mom's room; there is no relation. Moreover, considering my mom's compromised immune system and the condition of the patients in ICU, if she has bronchitis, she shouldn't be caring for anybody directly.

My mom has been very cold and when I requested blankets, I have always been forced to wait at minimum 30-40 minutes before having to fetch it for myself.

This lack of care and attention may seem trivial but, on this particular hospitalization, it caused the ICU staff to miss several critical vital signs of my mom. For the entire time here, my mom's heart rate has been elevated far beyond the normal range. The responsibilities of the nursing staff includes the monitoring of these kinds of obvious vital signs (the heart rate is the big glowing green number on the top of the vital signs screen). The nurses allowed this to remain unattended for 36 hours at least and yesterday evening, the heart rate accelerated and became irregular, frequently spiking over 200 bpm. This is the range that threatens a heart attack.

By a lucky coincidence, Dr. Syed Shah, a kidney specialist, happened to be seeing my mother and noticed the irregular heartbeat, ordering the nursing staff to provide treatment to my mom and to call a cardiologist. Since the initial treatments last night, my mom's heart rate improved, but still required more treatment as it remain 40 beats above normal on average. None of the nurses recorded this and they all allowed my mom's heart to race until just a few hours ago.

I'm not the kind to cause trouble but the nurses left my mom with a high heart rate which prevents her from being able to sleep and causes feelings of anxiety and discomfort; my mom was left in this condition for over a day without seeing the cardiologist at all. I had to severely reprimand the nursing staff and suddenly, they decided to medicate my mom further and to bring in the cardiologist late in the evening. Only now has my mom's heart rate returned to normal.

The point of my story is this: Southern Hills has nice facilities but if you or a loved one are suffering from a serious condition, understand that the attention you receive will likely be sparse. If you are unable to monitor your loved one's condition, I suggest you find treatment elsewhere. Remember, the nursing staff in this incident should be experts at their profession as they are the ICU staff; instead Southern Hills has the ICU run by the amateur, the superstitious, and the uncaring, forcing the patient's family to get them to do what should be the routine job of watching something like the heart rate. I can only imagine how much more incompetent the nurses are on the less critical floors.

I want to mention an evening nurse named Rick, who was a decent, attentive professional, but one nurse is not enough to overcome all these other shortcomings.",2
620905,8BCuIzSRr6WiL0b2j8zLtA,d-S7YIbeKqUAuspIoOedmQ,"UPDATE 4/3/2012

I'd like to add another experience that I forgot to mention. My mother cannot eat from her mouth as it causes severe coughing because of damage received from a surgery to the throat over ten years ago. For the last two years now, she receives food, water and medication through a GI tube connected directly to her stomach.

This is all clearly spelled out in my mom's medical chart, yet the nurse who received my mom somehow missed this and forced her to take medication through the mouth. She only coughed out the pill several hours later. This, by itself, is ridiculous and intolerable but it's made even worse by the fact that my mom came to the hospital for treatment of her lung. This gross oversight made my mom's condition far worse than it had to be for the first day or so. Of course, I needn't mention the severe discomfort this put my mom through, having to deal with a pill and water stuck in her lungs.

This further underscores my review. The care at Southern Hills is inadequate at best. Once more, remember this is the behavior you can expect from the nurses that are supposed to be the cream of the crop, the ones charged with the care of the critical patients in the ICU.

It's so frightening that a nurse won't even read a chart before administering treatment. When I confronted her, she just shrugged and dismissively said ""I don't know."" Well lady, I don't know how you're a nurse. I can only hope this review puts pressure on Southern Hills to raise their standards of care.",2
620906,BG7F9GT0NJU4aTiE6qtGUw,d-S7YIbeKqUAuspIoOedmQ,"I delivered my baby here in February 2012 and overall I was happy with my experience.

This hospital is fairly new and is never crowded. The few times I have been here it has actually been pretty deserted, even the emergency room. I was here for an outpatient surgery last year and had a good experience that time as well.

The room I had in Labor and Delivery was nice and spacious. The bed was comfortable as far as hospital beds go. There is cable TV and wifi. There is a bed that folds out for your partner to sleep in. They did everything in the same room without having to move me. I was in the room during labor and for the delivery. My baby was cleaned, weighed, checked and whatever else they do all in the same room. I liked that my baby was always in the room with me.

I elected to get an epidural and I wasn't happy with the anesthesiologist. He was very cold. Getting a needle poked into my spine is scary enough and his attitude made the process even more nerve wracking. Luckily the epidural lasted through the entire labor.

I had several nurses help me during my stay. A few nurses were better than others. It is easy to tell which nurses were there for a job from those who truly care about their patients. The nurse who assisted me during my delivery was great. She made me feel comfortable and was a wonderful coach when I had to push. 

After delivery, I was moved into another room for recovery. The room was smaller but was still spacious and had all of the amenities I needed. The nurse who assisted me in that room was not very helpful. She kept leaving the door open whenever she left the room which was inconvenient for when I was by myself and trying to breastfeed. The two nurses who assisted me after her shift were much better. Both of them were very caring and checked on me and my baby regularly.

I wish this hospital had more support when it comes to breastfeeding. As a first time mom, it would have been helpful to see a lactation consultant. I did take a class prior to delivery but all of my studying didn't help when I needed it most. 

All in all, I had a pleasant experience at this hospital.",4

I like coming here, plus its super close to my house so its like win on top of win on top of win !",4

So far I have had two major surgeries performed at this hospital and both times have been remarkable experiences. The staff that works there are very competent and sincere in what they do.

I had another surgery performed there yesterday and once again I had a pleasant experience. My nurse made sure that I understood the procedure and that I was comfortable. As a matter of fact, anyone who I came in contact with that worked for the hospital made sure that I was comfortable. Whenever I need to get a surgery performed, this will be the first hospital of choice for me. It is very clean and the employees take great care of their patients. I can definitely see why they were voted to be one of the best hospitals, they have my support in backing that statement up for sure.",5

One major problem....hubby went home and loaded up on snacks for us to have during our 5 day stay.  He brought apples, carrot sticks, cheese, pineapple, a couple of tupperwares of leftovers and so on.  He labeled it as instructed with our name and room number and put it in the pantry.  When we went to get it, someone threw it all away!  They threw away all or our tupperwares and everything!  What the heck?!?!? how rude!!!

620910,Wx23DAKqtahktST_bPClFA,d-S7YIbeKqUAuspIoOedmQ,"So, back from my 6 month hiatus, I'm starting with this LONG overdue review...

*SIGH*
You would think that a hospital that's not as old as the other hospitals in town like this one compared to other ones that have been around for a few decades would AT LEAST have better customer service, educated doctors and new technology.,..................

I have family members that have had the unfortunate experiences of having to be hospitalized numerous times and I've always been selected as the overnight companion so although I was never the patient, I was always accompanying someone who was the patient. I've stayed at several hospitals in town and I have to say, Southern Hills is HORRIBLE.

1. The nurse at the E.R. desk right when you walk in obviously doesn't like her job. She was rude and would probably be a lot prettier if she smiled.

2. When someone is placing an I.V. into someones veins and this someone works in the E.R. (a department where I'm pretty sure they do this shit often) you would think that they could place it without bruising someone who doesn't bruise easily. 

3. When a patient says he doesn't want to take a medication because he doesn't like the side effects and to please find another alternative (which is your right) you DON'T say ""But, the Doctor ordered it, you'll be fine"". Bitch, let me take a medication that makes you queasy and pump it into your system and see how you like it!!!

4. You know it's a bad sign when the patient is able to manipulate the Doctor's decision towards the patients preferences. 

5. When this hospital opened, flat screens were already in existence... Tell me why this place looks like it opened in 1980?!

Honestly, I'd rather take the extra 5 minute drive down to Spring Valley Hospital purely based on customer service and knowledgeable staff. It's as though they send new grads to Southern Hills Hospital. Even my Endocrinologist that's in the Medical Center is a friggin' twit! It's an extra 5 mins away, JUST GO TO SPRING VALLEY HOSPITAL.",1
620911,W_piF08OlauRZHkeW3J14w,d-S7YIbeKqUAuspIoOedmQ,"Rating a hospital is not always a good thing.  I'm not a fan of hospitals at all, regardless if there are good things that do happen there, like baby births.  Unfortunately for me, I had to get checked into the emergency room around 1:30am.  I was in the most pain I had ever experienced in a long time.  The lady at the front must have noticed how much pain I was in, because she quickly checked me in.  I had to wait about 5 minutes for a bed, which felt like forever when you are in pain, but luckily I was able to get in and get taken care of immediately. 

I didn't get out of the hospital until almost 9am in the morning.  The delay was mostly because they were doing plumbing repairs and the water was shut off, so their laboratory was unable to perform tests.  I had to wait for my blood work to be done off-site.  Overall though, they were friendly to me the entire time, tried to make me feel comfortable and diagnose my ailment.  For a hospital experience, an emergency one at least, I would rate it a comfortable experience and the doctors and staff were professional and a class act.  I'd definitely go back to them for ER or any other services if needed in the future.  Hopefully this will be my first and last review.  I'm not interested in being back inside a hospital.",4

The ER was completely empty which was nice but now i know why. Once in a ER room I was seen by about 6 different people and every time I told them the situation how my leg was run over they each started laughing and the doctor even had the audacity to comment on my hair color (it being blonde) I have never felt so disrespected in my life and he wouldn't even show me my test results from my cat scan and xrays.

My wife and I really loved how friendly and how informative the staff was here they really made us feel comfortable and at home. The nurses really made us feel welcomed.

My wife and I saw the delivery room and it was big and they explained that you stay in the same room through your entire pregnancy. The one thing that stuck out to me about the room and the only reason we did not go with Southern hills was because... (ok now this might seem small but ill explain) the TV was an old tube TV. 

Now i know for most people they would say you didn't choose the hospital because of the TV??!! and I would say yes!! And I will explain my thought process behind this. The reason that the TV made me uncomfortable was because this is going to be my first baby and I want to make sure my kind has the best that healthcare can provide. NOT SAYING THAT THE BABY WILL WATCH THE TV but if a hospital does not have a budget to upgrade their TV's what do i expect of the medical equipment I can only hope that the medical equipment takes a priority in being upgraded but by leaving an old tube TV it just made me weary about the equipment all together.

Nobody seems to know WHY she's here. She's been given random tests that nobody seems to be able to explain why & what for?!
She didn't come in with any pain- but they wanted to give her morphine... When she said NO... Their response is ""YOURE REFUSING?!?!""
They can't seem to get her prescription timing/dosage correct, much less how about listening to her when she's telling you which prescriptions she EXACTLY ON.

The nurses aren't listening to what she's saying. The doctors aren't listening. 

She wasn't given any towels to wash up. She asked for a toothbrush & toothpaste... LAST NIGHT... She got it this morning. 

They woke her up all night to draw vials of blood the size of tobasco. Then they woke her again to give her a stress test...(unnecessary)~the meds they gave her made her dizzy & nauseas and when she didn't want to get on the treadmill (because of the dizziness)... They again said ""YOURE REFUSING?!"".... She's DIZZY FROM THE MEDS YOU GAVE HER-so it's your fault! 
Furthermore... She also hadn't eaten since 6pm yesterday,.. Now it's 11:25am... Guess what-they never fed her breakfast!!!! When I complained her nurse said he'd bring her a Popsicle... I had to go complain again to actually get it... So now suddenly they say they are bringing her an ""early lunch""... It's 11:25am.... That's not EARLY!!! 

Ironically it's now 11:35... They just brought her BREAKFAST??!!! WTF.

I think I'd rather be dead than have to go through that again.",1

There was a couple of questionable actions by a nursing assistant who seemed to be making wrong decisions but at least someone was there to catch them. Anesthesiologist was amazing and full of information. Dr Liu the surgeon did an amazing job again  1st day was great. 2nd day was questionable . There was an emergency on our floor which took away my nurses attention most of the day.Props goes to my physical therapist Amber who was so well trained and professional and acted quickly and properly when my blood pressure took a dive and she acted professionally and calmed me.

His sugar is so high and he is really ill. Upon arrival to the emergency desk, there's nobody there just us and this clerk at the front was making me sign in. I asked if she can pull out my husband's name. Her response was, "" I have one patient here."" There were 3 people inside that booth. I usually bring my husband to this hospital for emergency reason. This time, we came to Fremont Medical Center. They accepted my husband as soon as possible no question ask.  Southern Hills Hospital lost $50,000.00 tonight.

I needed stitches and was going to head down to my nearest hospital. The nurse told me though, expect a 5 hour wait if you go to the hospital on St. Rose and Eastern. ""You're better off driving the 215 to Durango and going out there. You'll be seen immediately!""

So... I took her word and drove out the extra 20 minutes. Sure enough, I walked into an EMPTY ER. No kidding! I filled out some forms, and my name was called within 10 minutes of my arrival. I got my stitches from a handsome doctor named Matthew Vander Woude and I was out of the hospital and back in my car within an hour!

The stitches look great.
I'd take a picture of them but I'd probably gross yelpers out.
Seriously though. The San Martin Campus ER rocks!! THERE WAS NOBODY THERE!! I'm sure this won't last but it's such a great tip for now! (8/5/07)",5

Even though it seemed like we waited forever for the process of pre-registering, the staff was very friendly and efficient once they made contact. I stayed in her hospital room with her all day long each day and the nurses took excellent care of her: very friendly, quick response times, and they were comforting and encouraging. That's just what a patient needs.

Only a single negative to mention:  I found it absolutely ridiculous that they charge ~$3 for in-room movies. You're paying $2k/day for the room, so that's really just insulting!

Each time I was taken back within 10 minutes and seen almost immediately. The doctors and nurses were kind and comforting and got me settled quickly. Blood was drawn and tests were performed shortly after seeing the doctor. On each visit, I was in and out in less than 2 1/2 hours. That's amazing, considering the fact that I probably would have been waiting in the waiting room at Siena that long before even being seen.

But this emergency room was EMPTY!!!  I showed up and was immediatly seen.  Everyone was super nice and quick.  I was literally in and out within one hour.  And I wasn't going in for a simple procedure either....

-1 star becuase after treatment they moved me back into the waiting room to see how I'd do.  Hmmmm.... why not leave me in a bed all comfortable in back?  You're not that busy!

When we were looking for our home,we seriously were looking for a house in the neighborhood simply for the hospital. 

This was a few months ago, but they deserve a review for our experience. BF had a ER stay from a random cyst that grew on his hip quickly then burst. The ER had only a handful of few people and he was processed quickly and taken in. The head nurse came in to see him pretty quickly to examine him and do the basics, put the IV in, etc. We were waiting not for very long until the nurse came to check on him and apologized but said they will be tied up for the moment because a major accident rolled in and to let the nurse assistants know if he needed anything. He didn't care, they got him all fucked up on some morphine drip and feeling good. Haha. 

The next part was not so pleasant. The doctor came in and had to cut out the cyst from his side and pack it, but it needed to go. The only hangup is that the head nurse gave him a antibiotic (if I'm not mistaken- Bactrim) with a dose of Mylanta and the BF is very sensitive to antibiotics and didn't eat all day. He said the stomach pains were just bad if not worse than the cyst removal. Told them he hasn't eaten and they just went ""oh well you should have said something about him not eating""..... I didnt think it was important so I can forgive them for not asking. I mean, would you remember to ask if you ate when it was 5pm in the afternoon? Most people are bound to have eaten something by then- but we are NIGHT folks so no. 

The nurse instructed me on how to dress his wounds, what to look for and sent me home with a bag of dressings and tapes that is the sturdiest to withstand moving with the hip and directed us to make a check up in a few days.

Even with the emergency that moved us down the priority list, we still got out within 5-6 hours which is not bad for minor surgical procedure ....other ERs you cant even get admitted in that amount of time. If I was near UMC/Summerlin/Valley/etc, I'll get myself, even bleeding and all, away from there and come down here. 

Other than the ER, some of the regular practitioners are great here....we live in the NW and drive down for Pauline Chao, Internal Medicine.

The only reason I give this place 4 stars is because sometimes the doctors can be prima donna's. They are entitled to be that way sometimes considering all the experience and school they have but still. We had an awesome nurse who was very helpful and went out of her way to get us answers.

But as I was in the room getting my vitals done, I hear a nurse go ""I didn't know a UTI was an emergency."" I found that to be past unprofessional. I didn't appreciate her remark. Then after I had my urine sample, I attempted to ask the nurse what to do with it and she barely allowed me to ask the question as she walked off saying ""take it in the room with you."" I was in a waiting room type of area and didn't exactly want to sit there with a cup of urine. I did get to see the doctor quickly(Dr.Hayes) who was nice. He did indeed confirm I had a UTI.

I was there every 3 hours to feed my baby while she was staying at San Martin so I met everyone that came in. We didn't meet the doctor caring for my baby until day 5 after I demanded to talk to him.

We usually go to the Sienna campus, but it has gotten so crowded and busy that we decided to try the San martin campus.  On his first time there in December 2011, he was admitted through the ER. It was fast. No waiting. Then he was put in a room on ER and tests began. Everyone was great and kept us abreast of all that was happening. He was there until late in the night when they moved him to a room on the surgical floor. Again, everyone there was friendly efficient and helpful. On the third or fourth day I noticed as I was helping him with his food plate, that there were sugar packets on the tray. (He is a severe diabetic) I brought it to the nurse's attention and she got right on the phone. So happens that his sugar was running quite high. (I wonder why) They found out that when the doc put him o a cardiac diet, the kitchen decided to ditch the diabetic diet. Finally got that fixed. 

He had to go back in this week (jan 2012) and the er was just as quick with nobody in the waiting room. Everything went just the same. By the time I could get to his room, the food ray was gone but I went to the desk to tell them what happened last time and hope to preempt any problems. The next day I got there and sure enough, sugar packet. The desk tole me ""he is on a cardiac diet"". I told her I knew that but he still needed to be on a diabetic diet too.

I was supposed to get a outpatient op for my gall bladder. after the op the nurse said i have to stay over night because they needed to give me a second op tomorrow morning. I should have told her i will come back tomorrow & do the second op but, being a first timer in a hospital situ I relented & stayed over night. I really think that because they saw that I had 2 insurances that they totally took advantage of me. I didn't need to stay that night.  I was unprepared for this stay so i didn't have any over night clothing or grooming products. Of course they ""kindly"" offered up grooming products, at a seriously ridiculous high price. 
After my second op to observe & possibly clean out the gall stones that were supposedly stuck I was in intense pain!! Holy cow! The 1st shift nurse was sympathetic with my screaming & crying & gave me pain meds that I really needed to block the pain. the 2nd shift lead nurse chuckled when i asked her for more medication & said sorry i gave you all i could. I am not a crier but i was in severe pain & couldn't handle it. I couldn't believe she actually laughed at my situation. The graveshift nurse was nice & assisted me. 
The next night the graveyard assistant nurse decided to wake me up & noisily clean my room at 1am in the morning!! I couldn't believe it. I asked her why she was in my room and she said that she needed to take my vitals. I told her to take my vitals and get out because i was trying to sleep. she ignored me till i started to scream at her & swear ""to get the f... out of my room"" she finally took my vitals and left.
The dr. who did the 2nd op saw me on the 3rd day & I begged him to please get me out of here. I didn't have one night of actual sleep because nursing staff kept on interrupting me. He told me that my liver count was still off but he would give them orders to not enter my room unless it was an emergency. Finally got a good nights sleep & my liver count was lowered.

She was comfortable and well taken care of for the two days we were there. The delivery went smoothly even though there were multiple babies being delivered the same hour as us.

I wish I could say that he got good care but the goulish way he was treated was awful. They pushed hospice like angles of death and didn't listen when we told them no. They wouldn't give him a feeding tube and nearly starved the man to death. They told us he had mersa one day, then the next told us they were wrong and acted like the infection in his blood was therefore non consequential. We knew Dad was not going to get better, but we did not want him to suffer and he suffered, calling out for food and water. We had to make food and bring it ourselves to try to help him. We even had to hire someone to help take care of him while he was there. Doctor Tacvarian was the worst! She told me he should go to hospice and I told her he couln't go unless he was inpatient. She said he could be but was wrong. So then we were trying to get him healthy enough to go to the Vetran's home. The Hospital did an eval and had him all set to go to some other one star nursing home we never approved! He could never emain stable long so they basically wanted to dump him when they could call him stable for 5 mintues. Tacvarian was being paged to my dads room and never came. We went to get a cup of coffee and she was sitting there doing NOTHING! I fiored her and she still showed uop in ICU when he had been out on Morphine to relieve his suffering and tried to argue with us STEALING THE LAST PRECIOUS MINUTES WITH OUR FAMILY! 

My father died haveing starved and thirsted and been in agony for weeks that could have been prevented. But he wasn't worth it to them. 

********************
Since my last review my father has been here several times. I still like the fact that it is fast to get in through the ER, but I do have a few concerns that I want to make known. Though I will say, some of it may just be endemic in what is an increasingly money oriented rather than care oriented medical system.

In February 2013 my father needed to go again for symptioms of fluid accumulation assicated with Congestive Heart Failure. he is diabetic and we brought a list of his medications with him. However, they once again ignored his diabetes and served him a general diet repleat with cookies and pudding. Despite my telling them every day, it persisted and when they discharged him to rehab, they failed to even mention his diabetes. 

He was rushed back to the hospital after only being out of rehab for a week. He stopped breathing and sugar plummeted to 30. He was admitted and ventalated, in a light coma state for three days. Let me state that the nurses in ICU: Grace, LaTonia, Pat were great. They were attentive and knowledgable and caring. The medical team got him back and slowly he began to improve. He had fluid in the area outside his lung and they had to drain nearly 5 liters of fluid! It became obvious as we looked back that this problem existed even in his prior admission, but went unadressed on the general care floor he had been on. During rehab he constantly complained of shortness of breath. Who would be able to catch their breath with 5 liters of fluid pressing on their lungs!!!!! The ICU addressed everythign comprehensiely. They were worried about aspiration into his lungs due to swollowing problems and put him on a puree diet, no straws, thickened liquids only and eat upright with chin down. He was moved to intermediate and then the general care floor.When I arrived yesterday it was dinner. The aide was feeing him from an unthickend can of nitrition drink through a straw in a near prone position. When I directed her to the giant yellow sign on the wall with the eating rules on it she said he was doing fine. I told her she was not the one to make that decision and she needed to follow the orders of the therapist as approved by the doctor. She gave me push back and I told her to raise him up and that I would finish feeding him. 

The day before that there was a can of ensure on his try. I asked for the dietician to come in and told her that every time he is here nobody seems to understand this man is a diabetic and that his condition is severe. She said they just give insulin when needed. I guess they dion't feel like huge swings in his sugar is detrimental to his wellbeing. I do. She agreed to remove the ensure and to talk to the doctor. But the issue persists with me addressing it on a daily basis with no relief. All the otehr care he is getting is great...but not the eating and diabetic part of it.  Because of that, two stars wre removed.",1
764482,hPaKIfHI5uddocXxopF-4g,5FTEU6KCvMeZyuqkbLAWtw,"I first checked out St. Rose San Martin with my wife because our ob suggested trying this hospital, since we did not really like summerlin and saw it as our only option.

When we arrived we sought help from the information desk and there was a young gentlemen who lacked personalty and knowledge. For instance instead of the gentlemen seeing that we looked lost and asking us if we needed help. We had to approach him and ask where delivery was. He did not know we seen a RN walking by and asked her she quickly explained that labor and delivery was on the second floor.

We went up to the second floor and where given a tour of the labor room. The labor room was quite big and they even offered a small chair that turns in to a bed for dad to spend the night in. We were informed at this time that the baby will not be leaving the room during our stay there unless there is a complication. This really excited my wife and I.

The staff was overall very professional and i was excited to be picking this hospital as the one we would be delivering at.",4
764483,JFCQ7g-Fgxnlrr5RCMuFew,5FTEU6KCvMeZyuqkbLAWtw,"My last review was written on a day that I went to St. Rose. However that specific day was not the day I did the tour that day i was actually at St. Rose because our obgyn advised to go to the hospital due to dehydration. At this visit I had very bad experience which caused me to look for patients advocate. I went to the information desk and had a difficult time getting to understand who i was looking to speak with finally one of the volunteers called the house supervisor. The house supervisor came down and fixed the ""incident"" i had. I did not want to write my review based solely on that experience so i held of on writing this review.

On 5/14/2013 my wife and I came to the hospital as she was scheduled to be induced. We were quickly greeted on the second floor and promptly escorted to a clean and sterile room. As we setup our nurse for the day came in her name was Darlene and the CNA's name was Douglas. Now at first I was a bit on the fence about having a male CNA. Lets be honest as a man i don't want ANY other man touching my wife unless he's some type of doctor and someone that I'm completely comfortable with to just throw someone I've never met in the loop and say hey this dude is going to be sticking his fingers in your wife just watch makes me very uneasy. I decided to see how things went and if i didn't feel comfortable i would be saying something but let me say that Douglas has to be the most professional and well mannered CNA that I've met. He always remained professional and his attitude never changed through out the day. Darlene was also great she went above and beyond to make sure my wife and myself where beyond comfortable she defiantly deserved and applause with her and Douglas i think I'd call them the dynamic duo :)!!!

The one thing that did occur in the middle of our stay was that engineering came to the room and swapped out the whiteboards. They put up new and better looking whiteboards however he didn't clean up after himself he left the old whiteboards on the floor of the room and they stayed there through our entire stay I guess no one cared that 1 it was an eye sore and 2 it was in the way. I found it interesting how engineering has time to swap whiteboards but there's no time to fix the broken number 2 in the second elevator. I also asked 3 times for engineering to come to the room to check the hot water and a leak in the shower head well i think I'm going to check out and i don't think these issues will get addressed.

The induction lasted longer then when expected so it ran late at 7 we had a shift change and a new nurse her name was angella. As soon as Douglas introduced us i felt a little put off as she seemed a little perturbed and very phlegmatic. I tried not to be put off by this and i figured like Douglas i would give this nurse a try. When labor started to occurred the doctor and everyone was great. I however did catch myself looking over at the nurse several times and instead of being focused on the labor i caught her watching TV several times I figured I just looked at her when she wasn't truly looking. I then wanted to step outside for a moment since the baby was out I asked Angella if I would get a bracelet to identify me as the dad she said yes but they would not be printed till tomorrow morning i thought this was odd but i didn't make a point about it, We then wanted to try and breast feed the baby at this hospital there is a lot of breast feeding information so i thought we would get great assistance WRONG we asked angella for assistance and she seemed so frustrated by us that she told us that if we really wanted to feed him and she couldn't breast feed on her own we could give him a bottle. I then asked about engineering possibly coming to check our bathroom because there was a leak in the shower and the water was not SO hot. Her answer well shes not going to taker a shower now so they will not come and they might come in the morning I guess I'm chopped liver and don't need to take a shower. At this point I was fed up and asked to speak with the charge nurse and I expressed my frustrations thankfully Rose the head nurse was happy to take over for the rest of the night.

764484,WfwxKDtHGoffu_YJWwZ8mg,5FTEU6KCvMeZyuqkbLAWtw,"My overall experience here was descent. I'd want to say good but I don't feel that all my issues where addressed in a timely manner. The Staff here can be great and has awesome potential, I believe  it can become one of the best hospitals in the Las Vegas Valley. Just like any business there are always those bad seeds though that tend to make us think horrible about a place. In my experience I happened to encounter one of those. My wife begged me to not write such a review and to not look for upper management to rectify the issue, however I believe these issues need to have some light shed on them and need to be addressed because nurses doctors cna's etc.. all have peoples lives in their hands. There not playing with nickels and dimes there playing with our lives my child's life my wife's life this is not Milton Bradley's Operation. This is REAL LIFE!!! 

The Hospital itself is clean and has some awesome staff, sometimes you do have to stay on top of the staff to see a resolution but you get one!!! Your voice and opinion seems to actually matter and it should be that way this is not a county hospital. I'm not in LA at ""killer king"". 


Food: Overall we choose to stay away from the hospital food i did try everything though just to say i did and it was regular hospital food. Rather flavorless and mundane. Out of all 3 campuses its my opinion that De Lima has the hospital food with the most flavor if that is possible.

Parking: There is a giant Lot in the front of the hospital, however if you happen to stay overnight the Main Entrance Closes at 9pm and you have to exit and enter through emergency. Now for the person who didn't know this like myself you will find one issue once you exit through emergency YOUR car is on the complete opposite side of where you are so you have 2 options walk all the way around the entire parking lot which takes a good 15 minutes or take a ""hidden trail"".

HAHA HA !! i got you excited hidden trail where is it can i go whats it like is it forestie will i need a poncho YES and NO. ok so if you casually walk over to the garden they have to the right of emergency there is a waterfall where the path ends and this is where it GETS ZELDAISH!! You will need to turn on your batman night vision with out anyone knowing because you must be careful and follow the foot prints up the forestry jungle that resembles a garden of Eden and walla your on the other side!!! you probably still cant see your car but you can see the handicapp parking for the rehabilitation center they have and once you pass that VICTORY IS YOURS!!!!!",4

Only one nurse that my husband disliked but she left shortly after I was accommodated and the rest of my nurses were wonderful helpful and worried about my diet making sure I was happy and fed as well as baby :) I'm not I a hospital person so I rushed outta there ASAP but honestly couldn't have asked for more. Plus who can say they got to see transformers on a flat screen while giving birth .. Not many but this girl can :)",5

I was a bit nervous since I had never had a baby before but everyone was so friendly and caring that it put me at ease. The RN who assisted me during my delivery, Doug, explained everything he was going to do, why he was doing it and what I should expect to feel every step of the way. Dr. Angela Ciklin preformed the delivery. She was so supportive and encouraging the entire time. I really felt cared for and pampered here. I could go on about the attentiveness of all the staff but let's just say everyone was very friendly and genuinely cared about my well being.",5
764487,T7Mtk-Cor7vb8j5RtI3KQg,5FTEU6KCvMeZyuqkbLAWtw,"If you are giving birth DO NOT GO HERE! Crappy service, Crappy food and double the pay! I delivered my second child two weeks ago and felt tortured. I had my first delivery two years ago at St. Rose Sienna and had a good experience so I thought that since they are both named St. Rose, they would have the same quality care. As soon as I got wheel chaired in, since I was already in active labor, the nurse had to poke me 3 times and kept popping my vain which resulted in a huge bruise on both arms. Right there and then I knew I made the wrong decision. So everything else went smooth and my awesome OB came who barely got any help from the nurse. She even had to clean up and was doing their job after the delivery. 8 hours later I'm still sitting in a pool of blood because the nurse said that two other person came in to give birth. And when she finally came I was breastfeeding my daughter so I asked her if she can come back and she replied, ""Its either she cleans me up now or she will have to help someone else and won't be back for who knows how many more hours. I told her its ok to help someone else. Then that morning, I was STARVING for food and I remember that St. Rose Sienna always had great food, so I was anticipating to place an order, which they do at Sienna. Instead a man comes in the room drops of two trays and leaves. It was definitely not enough and my husband had to go downstairs to the cafeteria and spend $20 to get more food. So someone came in and I complained about the breakfast. They finally gave me a sheet to order from which I was familiar with from Sienna. I ordered my lunch and dinner. Lunch came and it was ok, and then dinner came and it wasn't what we ordered. So I called the nurse to let them know and the same guy that dropped of the breakfast came in our room with an attitude saying that what we ordered was for the following day???  And that if we wanted what we actually ordered it's going to take hours. Then how come our lunch came out ok. And we placed it the same time? Anyways, I ended up breaking down and crying because I felt like they were so rude. Good thing there was an employee, who actually work in a different department (social secutrity/admin) who went out of her way and went straight to the kitchen to get our food.  After that incident I wanted to run home and get out of there! I made sure I left 24 hours after my delivery and not anytime longer. I ended up leaving the hospital at 9PM because I didn't want to stay overnight. Now that I'm home I just got a bill from San Martin twice as much as I had to pay at Sienna. Keep in mind I stayed at Sienna for almost 4 days and they served us steak and prawns our fist night as new parents and at San Martin I only stayed for 1  1/2 days. On top of that I got another bill stating that their workers are not employees of the hospital?? They are contracted and that there is a separate bill for their care also. UNBELIEVABLE!! I don't usually do reviews but I thought that it would help other expecting mothers to make the right decision. Giving birth is such an experience that its so important to get special care. I wouldn't want anyone else to go through what I went through. San Martin SUCK!",1

Anyway I couldn't stop thinking about it, so I went to the hospital since it was close to midnight and everything else was closed of course. The front desk clerk took a copy of my ID and insurance card, the nurse took my blood pressure right afterward, it then took over 30 min for the front desk to ask for 100 cash down for my visit, waited an additional 30 for Dr Sensenig to see me, just so he could tell me I had a hook worm, thank you but already knew that. Then it took over 30 min for him to figure out what he should prescribe me. Turned out he prescribed me Mebadazole that was discontinued in the US back in 2011, he bills my insurance and I of course still have to pay the co pay for what I ask? Avoid this place.",1

They not only saved my life but the care the staff at this hospital gave was beyond any and all could be given.  From the staff that would clean my room to the charge nurses that visited everyday with wow just could not ask for more caring and professional group of people.  The hospital is on top of having the latest and greatest machines.  I had to stay a week here and it felt like I was being cared for by family. Those nurses in icu and imc need to be recognized for what they do.  I know in all my 46 years I have never been treated so well within the medical field.  I very much appreciate each and everyone of them.  I would not even have to think twice about going back here.  My hospital of choice from now on.,5

764493,IBwQoOK1jNM4WyDgEYGAvw,5FTEU6KCvMeZyuqkbLAWtw,"I was admitted to St. Rose-San Martin on September 14, 2012. I was treated with nothing but indifference the entire time I was admitted. My assigned hospitalist was Stephanie Hansen. She was nothing short of unprofessional the entire 19 days I was unfortunate enough to be hospitalized at San Martin. She often had food or worse spilled down the front of her white jacket. I know this because she rarely, if ever, yielded to the neutropenic precautions that had been put in place at my room and usually entered my room with no gown, mask, and gloves.

Dr. Wu, my assigned oncologist, was unable to diagnose me with anything despite subjecting me to a bone marrow biopsy, a laparoscopic surgical biopsy, and a CT guided needle biopsy. Dr. Wu asked several rheumatology related questions during the course of his ""treatment"" and promised to have a consulting rheumatologist visit me. He did not provide the rheumatologist until my husband and mother insisted that he had gone down that road and it needed to be followed through. Although he only provided the rheumatologist under duress, I was treated to a lecture each and every day from Dr.Wu about how attorneys and their lawsuits make his job nearly impossible. He also was the first person who recommended that I be medi-flighted to a tertiary care facility because he did not feel I would be diagnosed there. This was when I realized I needed to leave ASAP.

Dr. Rayles performed the laparoscopic surgery to biopsy an enlarged lymph node. Not only did he fail to remove any lymph tissue during the biopsy, he told me prior to the surgery that ""you and your family need to get your shit together."" Yes, he had the professionalism to use the word ""shit"" with a cognizant well-educated patient. This because he thought there was a disagreement between myself and my husband about proceeding with the surgery. 

Dr. Marquardt was one of the only bright spots during my stay at St. Rose. She actually took the time to discuss my symptoms with me and was well on her way to a diagnosis she I ended up being medi-flighted to UCLA.. She kept in contact with my husband during my continued hospitalization at UCLA. 

Another bright spot was a nurse Lindsey. She actually made me feel that she was concerned about me and whether I lived. She prayed with me prior to procedures and was very caring.

My overall impression of St. Rose-San Martin is that they can probably handle a broken bone, an obvious pregnancy, or a minor diagnosis. However, if they don't know what's wrong fairly early, my advice is to get out and find someone who can figure it out.",1

From my pre-op appt to the actual day of my surgery, I experienced the most fabulous staff and all of them looked genuinely happy to serve there. Although the surgery before mine went 2 hours longer than planned, the staff kept me comfortable and had the best bedside manner I've ever seen. When I finally made it back to surgery, they were gentle and totally eased any fear I had. Again, I can't recommend them enough. I will easily say that this staff renewed my belief that some people are truly born to be in the medical field. I signed up for yelp just to leave this review and I'm only post-surgery recovery day one. Thank you, San Martin campus for making my very first surgery experience a breeze!!!",5

The night I went into the hospital, I had severe pain in my upper left thigh like my leg was on fire.  I was concerned about a blood clot or something.  I had my sister take me to the San Martin hospital where I had seen my father had good care.  My visit was post Obama Care and my fathers was pre-Obama Care.  I have a high deductible as a result of Obama Care so I could keep my insurance.  Upon being seen, I was told not to provide any financial or insurance information.  I was put in a reclining chair and asked if I did any drugs, needle drugs, illegal drugs and so on.  I answered the questions without being offended.  Another nurse came over and asked the same questions. I answered the same way, I have never done drugs.  I was asked If I had multiple partners.  I am married.  A third nurse came over and asked me the same questions about drugs.  Now I am offended and I said hell no!  I received a shot of morphine for the pain at this point, I am taken for an X-ray.  After the X-ray, the Dr. comes in, asks me if I have taken any pills or drugs in the last 48 hours, I stated only the morphine the hospital gave me and he said"" I have looked at your X-ray and nothing is broken.  ""I do not know what is causing the pain.  You will have to have an MRI to determine if this is a blood clot or another sort of injury. ""  He left and so did I with the same problem I came in with.  No one there cared what type of treatment I received.  I received a bill for $2,462 for the services I received.  To go into the ER is over $1000.  I have no problem paying for services I received, however, this was crazy.  I called the billing dept.  No discounts will ever be made at any time for any person.  I was told that due the ER being staffed 24/7 these charges will be in place and it is my issue for not having adequate insurance that suits my needs vs. the health care facilities. I received services and it is my problem that I was not satisfied with the services I received.  I not only have this bill, I had to go to another DR. to a diagnosis, and treatment.  The second Dr.  $654.00 and I was not treated like a piece of human garbage that came in off the street.  DO NOT USE THEIR FACILITIES UNLESS YOU ARE PREPARED TO BE 8X THE ACTUAL COST!

764498,v9fFyF1bx4_VvzP2zG2FQw,5FTEU6KCvMeZyuqkbLAWtw,"I can't say enough good things about the labor and delivery and nicu at St Rose - San Martin. My wife was 36 weeks pregnant and having back pain and some contractions on and off. We weren't feeling the baby as much as usual so we went in. The triage nurse hooked us up and started monitoring. We were still not getting much movement so they ordered for an iv to maybe wake him up. After a few minutes they came back in with full staff letting us know they needed to get our son out. He would have a much better chance outside then in. Within 10 minutes she was on the table and I was in the OR with her. A minute later my son was born. They rushed him to the nicu where staff there gave him a blood transfusion and intubated him. A week later, he's doing much better now. 

As for the staff, they were all such wonderful people. From triage, to Dr Chambers who delivered him, to the anesthesiologist and everyone who took care of my wife and son. I'm so beyond thankful we went to this hospital. It may be a bit smaller, but because of that, I felt we had so much more attention. Everyone was very concerned for my wife and child. Even when nurses were off the clock, they'd still be checking in with the nurses in nicu on how our son was doing. 

So once again, THANK YOU to everyone at San Martin.  If you're looking for a place to deliver your baby, definitely take a tour of this great facility. I don't know what we would've done without these great people. My review doesn't do this place justice.",5

I was not able to count my contractions so I didn't think I was actually in labor. The nurse Nancy greeted us, she got us hooked to all the machines to start tracking my contractions and my son Lennon. She said we definitely were in labor. She started me up on an IV to see if that would stop my contractions. Within 20 minutes she came in saying that they were going to rush us in for an emergency c section because our son was unresponsive. He had a strong heartbeat but wasn't responding which they should with having an IV.  The hospitals laborist Dr. Chambers delivered our son within minutes. Our son was severely anemic due to losing a lot of blood inside of me. 

The NICU nurse Marie rushed him into the NICU and Dr. Z had started working on him. They did a blood transfusion 1 of 3 during his two week stay there. He was hooked up to many machines and they were watching him very intensely. Thankfully two weeks later he was able to come home with us. The nursing staff in labor and delivery/NICU were just beyond wonderful. They treated us like family not like patients. They cried with us and walked us through everything that was going on with myself and Lennon.  

-Nancy not only made the decision to save my life but my sons and I will forever be grateful to her. She is a true angel.
-Germaine, Holly, Cheilo and Marie in the NICU were also god sent. They watched over my son and made me feel at ease when it was time for me to go home and rest. Germaine got into an MRI machine with my son and held him because he wouldn't stop crying from the noise of the machine. Holly would call in on her days off just to check in and make sure Lennon was doing good that day. Cheilo got many late night calls from me checking on him and she always made me feel at ease that he was in good hands. 

We cannot say enough wonderful things about these group of angels at St Rose San Martin. We definitely recommend anyone getting ready to deliver to go here. You will not be disappointed. Don't know where we'd be without them.",5

We showed up for our induction, and even without any orders for my doctor, they were so super helpful. We induced around 9pm and my water broke around midnight. At that point, the nurses were very on top of ensuring my baby was okay. They constantly monitored me and were in and out of the room frequently to check on me. When we asked for pain medicine, it was promptly given. When we asked for the epidural, they were in the room within two minutes. The nurse held me as I writhed in pain from contractions and the anesthesiologist inserted the epidural. When that nurse left, she told us not to leave the hospital before she was able to meet our little one (she promptly came back in on her shift two days later to meet our baby before we left!). 

Once I was at 10cm, the nurse didn't leave my side. She did a wonderful job all throughout labor, and helped conserve my dignity when there were so many others in the room. Kortney was our nurse following delivery, and she was PHENOMENONAL!  She truly cared about us and our baby and didn't bat an eye when my husband kept requesting different things! She tried to rush our doctor because we wanted to leave, and she even stayed after her shift to help us out the door.

A few months ago my son had to rush me to the ER due to severe abdominal pain. The ER was terrible, I could barely walk in and I asked them to please help me. They told me that I must first fill out the forms, basically take a number and wait my turn. I was in severe pain, dizzy, and sweating profusely. I was clearly unable to function. I had decided to just fall on the floor and hope that they would help me. But, just at that moment, another waiting patient observed the pain that I was in and offered to help me with the forms - God bless you sir where ever you are!

After the longest 15 minutes of my life, they finally called my name. I recall that I kept repeating that I had good insurance. The Triage nurse ordered a wheelchair and I was soon given an injection of morphine (which was an enormous help). They then proceded to run tests which included a CAT scan. I waited for about 30 to 45 minutes until the ER doctor came in the room. He started off my saying that in his opinion there was absolutely nothing wrong with me.  I then asked him if he had bothered to examine the scans. He didn't say that he did or didn't examine the scans. But he did say that he would go and take a look at them. About 15 minutes later he came back in the room and said that my upper intestinal track was blocked on my right side. I informed him that was where I had abdominal surgery about 10 years ago. He responded with ""well that's what I needed to know"". Seriously?

Then I very kind nurse whose name was Carol then told me that I was being admitted to the hospital. She said that there were no rooms available and that I could either have a bed in the hallway or I could be transported to the St Martin Campus. I then looked down the hallway to see a row of beds occupied by patients lining the hallways. This was very disturbing so I gratefully accepted Carol's offer and waited for my ride. As the ambulance drivers wheeled me down the hallway, the patients in their beds were giving me words of encouragenment and good wishes as we rolled past their beds. Wow, what incredibly nice people!!!

The ambulance drivers were friendly and funny. The private room at the St Martin campus greatly exceeded my expectations. The care that I received at the St Martin campus was truly excellent in every way. Each and every doctor, nurse and technician that I encountered was top rate. They were able to successfuly ""unclog my drain"" and I went home the next evening. Thank you so very much St Martin!..  And to be fair, thank you too St Rose - Siena too, but you really need to work on some areas.",5
764506,F2qph6SKfHvXt5keeXJ0sA,5FTEU6KCvMeZyuqkbLAWtw,"Each time i write a review for the hospital i feel as if things get better only to get worse. In my previous review i wrote one thing that i didn't think i would get to touch base on again, but guess what coincidences happened and it just so happened to be a coincidence that i was in the same room that we gave birth to our first child in. I thought it was a good thing at first to be able to make memories in the same room with our new child until i remembered what i had written after being in the room for roughly 20 minutes and i quote""engineering to come to the room to check the hot water and a leak in the shower head well i think I'm going to check out and i don't think these issues will get addressed."" Well the hot water issue in room 270 in labor in delivery has not gotten addressed and its been over a year it has been such a common thing that when i brought it to our new nurses attention Laurel she simply stated that they were aware that the hot water didn't get hot in that room fast enough and that there work around was to use the hot water in the sink in the room itself and not the sink in the bathroom perhaps these nurses have forgotten what it was like to be giving birth but being embarrassed by having to have a door open while your husband tries to get you a hot washcloth for you to wash off is not the ideal solution and the fact that it has not been addressed in over a year is just baffling and not only does the hot water take a long time the water also backs up when you're trying to take a shower. SO PRAY THAT YOU DON'T GET ROOM 270 

My encounter with the nurses this time was a bit more pleasant although we did have moments of mis-communication the main nurse that we dealt with tried to make things right as much as possible but sometimes she did fail. Laurel was the name of our main nurse and overall she was ok except for the fact that I felt like she lacked a bit of empathy. Allow me to elaborate my wife and I arrived to the hospital around 8:00 am it was a Saturday and the hospital seemed a bit empty there was boxes that were littering the main entrance and they had not been covered by anything later in the day they were covered with sheets although they were a real big eye sore. When we arrived Laurel greeted us and took us to our room which seemed very familiar to me we had some small talk and she checked my wife she put in some bill to soften up the walls they said and then we waited my wife started having really bad contractions and so the nurse was called my wife was on the edge about getting or wanting an epidural she wanted to try natural birth so the nurse gave my wife some medication that ended up knocking her out and when she came to she was in extreme pain the anesthesiologist was called to do the epidural my wife was screaming from so much pain and Laurel came in said the anesthesiologist is here so we need you to sit up she did so but all of a sudden here screams became louder and seemed more painful it was to the point where we didn't know what or who was hurting her the anesthesiologist asked if it was him all of a sudden between the screams my wife blurred out i can feel his head i think I'm having the baby the anesthesiologist had not put the epidural in yet and he himself stopped and said I have not done anything if you would like we can check her well laurel being the helpful nurse she is decides that no its more important for him to get the epidural in, instead if asking my wife she just tells the anesthesiologist to proceed he continues and my wife continues to scream  the anesthesiologist finally gets the needle in and my wife sits back well guess what the child is crowning and he was coming out just like my wife had said If laurel would have taken the time to let my wife make the decision instead of her then my wife would've never had to get the epidural since the baby was already crowning at this point the anesthesiologist is nervous and starts to hit my wife with what i though was called boost but i believe i was later corrected to it being called a bolus dose this in turn made it hard for my wife to push because she all of a sudden became numb from the waist down and then it started to work its way up to her shoulders but the time the baby was out my wife was fully drugged up and could barely hold our baby I feel like these drugs where administered incorrectly because instead of it helping the the birth she literally just sat up barely holding onto consciousness.",2

You sign in and take a visitor sticker and then you are all set to go in. They have an absolutely gorgeous Christmas display next to the cafeteria. It is always clean and they have plenty of hand sanitizer and mask/glove stands if you would want to use those. Parking is plentiful and there is a drop off zone for both the ER and main hospital entrance. The set up of each floor is unlike any other hospital. It is spacious and the rooms are big and private.

Over the past 9 months I've been in and out of this hospital and I've a pretty good idea of the level of ""care"" here. I'm also from the Netherlands so perhaps used to something better than 1950s Russian-looking mortuary wards.

The staff is terrible at communicating, and that's kind of important when they're trying to stick stuff into you. The carpets are downright filthy, at one department I tried four toilets that were filled with diarrhoea before finding a toilet that was functioning and not full of s**t. 

If you're lucky enough to find a doctor in A&E, be prepared to wait for four hours before being told that you're going to be sent home, and 9 months for a diagnosis that would have been made in a week max in the Netherlands, is apparently, not uncommon.

If you're healthy, do not go here, if you're sick, DO NOT come here, as I guarantee that whatever you catch here will be worse than what you had to begin with. This is a sick, sick joke.",1

It's an amazing resource for the city and a reminder that free access to healthcare professionals who really care is something for which we should be extremely grateful.

I recently had to take my son in with an inexplicably (very) painful knee. The staff were unstintingly kind and turned what could have been quite a traumatic experience into something that bordered on fun (""I love having my bloods taken out""). We're not just talking toys in the waiting room - there was an 'art cart' loaded with fancy pens, stencils and bits to colour in and take home.

Communication was superb, with both me and with Sam - he was never excluded or talked down to. He likes to know what's going on and I'm confident that the fact they involved him so much made the tests more bearable. Even beyond the treatment, staff members passing us in the waiting area often stopped to ask how we were doing and have a quick chat.

The staff were extremely thorough, gave him loads of time and didn't diagnose him until they were confident they'd ruled out the more serious possibilities in several appointments over the course of a week.

Obviously I hope we don't have too many return visits, but I'm confident that if we are ever back we'll get brilliant, personal care in a really sensitive, child-focused environment.",5

The ER doctor and nurses were all thorough, friendly and attentive. All testing was performed on site and we were updated regularly. When my friend needed assistance, it was provided promptly. 

My friend was admitted and her room was lovely - very un-hospital with hardwood floors, a couch, cable, wifi, movie rental, a mountain view. The patient menu was varied and available 24/7 - we called it a ""cruise ship menu."" She had surgery the next day and some friends and I were even allowed to go to pre-op. Once the surgery was done, the surgeon came and found me to personally assure me that things had gone well. 

Thankfully, my friend is recovering nicely. We were both pleased with the care she received. Everyone was warm and calming in the midst of a stressful situation. 

Also, while there I ate in the cafeteria a few times. They serve full, hot meals most of the day as well as sandwiches 24/7. All was tasty. There is also a mini-Starbucks, which was appreciated. Again, the staff here was super-friendly and comforting.

The rooms are quite large and comfortable. There was a long desk table alond side the  window side of the room and also a couch/bed and a recliner chair. I did do some rearranging of the furniture to accomidate my son's wheelchair and the needs for me to get around. 

They supplied me with sheets and blankets and pillow for the bed along with towels etc to shower. What was amazing was that they provide you with breakfast (it was a little cold) and 2 meal tickets each day. now the meal tickets are worth $5 each and it is easy to go over that so be prepared to pay the extra. but it does help defer costs.

there is also a small fridge in the room so you might want to have someone bring you some sodas or snacks to keep around. there is a kitchen available with microwave and various snacks, ice cream, soda, juice, baby food, crackers, popsicles etc. 

the tv has a great variety of channels including on demand movies. there is a keyboard like a computer has for kids to choose different options on the tv like video games or movies etc. 

they have a DVD player in the room to select DVD's to watch. i did not go into the childrens play area but it look huge and inviting.

you must have your ID badge on you at all times so that you can get back on the ward and so that you can gain admittance to the 3rd floor large cafeteria.

the infusion therapy section is very nice there are 4 rooms that are enormous with 2 chairs one is a extra large very comfortable recliner. a swinging flat screen tv to adjust at most comfortable angles and community bathroom. the nurses are so great! and you are given as a parent a meal ticket and they will order a food tray for the child.

I reminded them of the quote and found that quote was convienently forgotten. No adjustment!  I was then inspired to research prices on the same aid elsewhere. Shame on me for spending that much money without researching it first. Found that I was overcharged by $1,200 or more depending on where I could have bought them. Again! No adjustment!  Most places throw the remote in for free.

I was charged the $80 out of pocket prescription fee, and then had to chase down the office to edit the prescription to a type of lens that I could actually purchase.

A year later, I returned for my yearly contact prescription.  Again, after two minutes in the room and barely a glance at my eyes, Dr. Sundar-Raj said that we should just reorder the lenses I had that were working well. Relieved that it would be easier this time around, I agreed.  When I got home (after paying another $80 out of pocket) it turns out that there was an error on the axis line of the prescription that made it not match up with the existing lenses I had that worked so well.  I've been on the phone with his office for over an hour trying to get this error corrected so that I can get my new contacts.  Of course the doctor doesn't want to admit to all of these errors, so he's insisting that the incorrect prescription is correct and refusing to change it.

So he has been uncomfortable after major surgery and unable to sleep due to bring on a broken bed for over 60 hours. So the hospital care coach, nurses and doctors told us they would get him a new bed, and more than 60 hour later, he's still in this broken bed. Also his gown does not fit or cover him, so the gown they ordered has also taken more than 48 hours to come in and upon his discharge still has not come in.

On top of all of this, the ceiling tile fell in his wing. Yes, the ceiling tile fell and laid on the ground for 4 hours... This was only after housecleaning walked over it and did not clean it up, twice. I'm pretty sure it's a fire hazard and in general not safe or clean to have a ceiling exposed in a recovery wing.

Why I was thirsty all the time.  Why I was tired all the time.  It was at my pediatrician's at Children's Hospital that I received the news that would change my life.  At age nine, I was told I had type-1 diabetes.

My nine-year-old mind blamed the doctors of course.  I was fine up until that point, right!  They must have put something in me to make me this way.  From that moment forward, everything had to be regimented.  My eating.  My testing my blood sugar.  I learned that I would have to have snacks when I was not hungry.  I learned that several times a day, I would have to prick myself with needles, take insulin, etc.

But y'know what?  In looking back, the care I received was wonderful!  They taught me and my parents that it was not the end of the world.  They showed me how it was nobody's fault that this happened.  They taught me how to take my insulin.  I learned through stories and children's books how to do this.  Much was being learned about diabetes back then (1986) and I discovered that I could still have a lot of the same foods I always liked.

Let me say that Children's guided me and my parents through all of this.  No, diabetes is not the end of the world for a 9-year old girl.  But they taught me well that everything changes when you're a diabetic.  Thanks to them, while I admit that I am not always a good girl when it comes to eating, I am meticulous about my healthcare.  I get my heart, teeth, kidneys, and feet checked on a regular basis.  I've become more consciencious about the obesity problem in this country.

I was a new mom, and I was terrified. Just three days earlier, her doctor had assured me this was just a cold- she'd be fine, he said. But when I checked on her and her breathing was shallow, I knew that wasn't the case. 

Enter Children's Hospital. I was frantic. I was terrified. They were wonderful- the staff was reassuring, they helped me as much as they could, ran a few tests, and found that she had pneumonia. Two days later, I was taking home my all-better little girl. 

I have never had a good experience with a hospital- this one's different. These people genuinely care about the kids. it's more than a medical healing center- they quell your fears. They play and act silly to cheer the kids up. If you're in the city and have a kid, this is where you want to go.",5

1013718,PdQ-MRqdhk26z1fyoLAz7A,EpLyvAlqd5kC2hSB1pQPVg,"The staff at this hospital needs to be evaluated. I've never experience so many people having attitudes at only 6pm. I went recently because of experiencing ten side effects from an antibiotic I was put on after a procedure. I thought the right thing to do before going was to look up the side effects to the medication to make sure what I was experiencing was actually from that. I waited around 4 hours in the er which wasn't that bad, just seems like forever when you're sick. When I get to a room is when hell started. This fat doctor comes in trying to over talk me and interrupt me constantly as im trying to explain to him what my symptoms are. I tell him I looked up the medicine since I misplaced the paper that came with the medication. This seemed to piss him off like how dare I look up my symptoms on the internet. He tells me he doubts what I'm experiencing is from the medication. I tell him I wasn't having problems before with; dizziness, nausea, joint pain, fever, chills, sharp eye pain, confusion, headache, peeing less, loss appetite and serious fatigue to the point I have to use my alarm to keep waking up. 

I told him this was affecting me at work really bad. He still didnt believe me. So he ordered a chest x ray and urine sample. When he leaves some male nurse with an attitude came in because I hit the light to ask for a blanket. He rolled his eyes and said yea but the doctor need a urine sample. I told him I've been having problems peeing lately. I hadn't peed since around 7 that morning. So he huffed and went out to get some fat ass what I'm assuming is a charge nurse. She came in asking what the problem was in a nasty way. I told her all I said was I've been having problems peeing. I asked her why I was being treated like shit and like I disrespected someone because I didnt. She said I had to understand the doctor is frustrated because he deals with emergency issues and mine wasn't an emergency. She was talking to me like I had no business even being in the er. I told her I rarely go to the er and I try to take care of myself at home when I'm sick instead of coming to the er to have to deal with people like her. I don't care to get looked at funny because I'm Black and like I'm there for drugs. I said I'm there for answers on why my body was doing what it was. She asked when I was looking up the side effects why didnt I look up a UTI? I said well I'm not a doctor how would I know to look that up? She was just being a bitch to me. 

My test results came back that I didnt have a UTI or anything like they thought so I'm told its a viral infection and that it may be my taking of the antibiotic after all. Like no kidding its the antibiotic. I told the nurse that was discharging me that I will never come back to this hospital. She was very sweet and understanding. She apologized for their behavior but the damage was done. I should've learned my lesson one of the previous times I was here and had a doctor flat out ask me did I have 8 kids and was I on Ahcccs? I couldn't believe this happened but how would I file a complaint with no witness? Noone would believe one of their wonderful doctors would do something like that to a patient. There are some serious racial issues going on at this hospital and I won't return. I'm proud of who I am and I won't stand for anyone trying to make me feel like less of a person.

When your loved one is hooked up to many many different wires, needles, bags, machines, etc. and the alarms are going off, it would be nice to actually have someone act like it matters. 
Its important to know that your loved one is being cared for as if they were the caregivers own family member. 
I actually never met or spoke to a Dr. but I did visit several times and each time the alarms would go off and after waiting several minutes we would have to go get a nurse. Some were well within hearing distance and we were always told they would be there when they were done with whatever else they were doing which was never with another patient.

I'm sure that the doctors are all good doctors, but they make mistakes too and the problem with those doctors is that they never admit it.  They all say, ""every procedures has risks"".  My wife was referred to Banner for a simple colonoscopy and an endoscopy with ultra sound.  She was in recovery with excruciating abdominal pain resulting in her having to spend the night on morphine.  They discharged her late that afternoon only to have her return at 1AM in the morning with the worst abdominal pain she has ever experienced.  She was there for 6 days, no food, little clear liquid diet and morphine, antibiotics and other meds administered.  Mostly the nurses were ok with the except of a few that had attitudes, and Gistopo nursing techniques.  Very rough and coarse.  PA's that don't have one iota of a clue as to what is going on and never stop to ask questions.  They just roll their eyes in disgust and walk out of the room.  It appears very evident that Banner really needs money, because we refused several tests that they wanted to perform and we said NO.

We wanted a second opinion and decided to try MD Anderson Cancer Center at Banner Gateway. I was told that we needed to gather her medical records and then they would make the first appointment. Did that right away. I called for an update and asked when we should expect a call back and i was told that its their policy not to give time frames for first appointments and that ill be notified once her records have been reviewed. I am pretty floored that a cancer center would add to the anxiety cancer patients and their families are already experiencing by not giving us any idea of when we can expect my mom to be treated.

I have been spending way too much time in hospitals lately.
This one was for the daughter of a friend in for some serious internal stuff.

I spent time with her in the ICU - as well as 2 ""regular"" rooms.

The hospital is well laid out, good signage, and not so large you can log a 5K getting from the parking lot to the rooms. It's new and clean, well appointed and almost seems more resort-y than hospital-y. (Piped in jazz with birds chirping playing outside, color-changing LED fixtures, etc.)

The staff has been hit and miss - but I think that would take place anywhere. When they are on, they are GREAT and the treatment I watched is everything you could want, other instances, It seems communication is a bit of an issue. (Too busy to log into the nearest computer and check the chart prior to entering the room? Could be - but it gives the impression the left hand doesn't always know what the right is doing.)

I am not a fan of foodservice only being from 7am to 7pm. 

And I really can't stand hospitals - so for me to consider one as A-OK is really quite good.",3
1013730,uNvMMNnsPCcVwsxwq48wTQ,EpLyvAlqd5kC2hSB1pQPVg,"I was at Banner Gateway for pain after a procedure. I arrived at about 3am and I was taken back right away. The triage nurse, Dr. Vance and my assigned nurse Paul were wonderful. I could not have received better treatment.

My problem came after I was discharged. I no sooner walked out the secure doors and realized I forgot to ask for a copy of my labs. I went and tried to ask the new triage nurse Steve or Steven if there was any way I could go back and ask the doctor or my nurse for a copy of my labs. He told me NO. I had to go to medical records because it was against hospital policy to release a copy of my labs. I then said to him that I have been a frequent patient over the last few months and it has NEVER been a problem before. I then stated that I did not feel well enough to walk down the hall to get them and I would just ask my family doctor to get a copy because that is who I wanted them for anyway. Steve(n) then said to me that I couldn't even do things the right way.

FIRST, I am the patient and I was there because I was in severe pain. Also, I am paying for a service and was not rude to him (yet) therefore he had no business treating a patient with utter disrespect. I walked away and said wow, what an ass. This nurse came out and chastised me in front of another patient. Really? What is wrong with having my doctor get my lab results? They then had security stand me because I appeared to be a threat.

I will never go back to this ER because after I spoke to the charge nurse, he did nothing to address how Steve(n)spoke to me.  The charge did go and ask for permission to give me a copy of my labs and brought them to me in front of the hospital where I stood crying. 

If you become a nurse to help people then maybe compassion is something that you should use. After my sleepless night due to pain, I did not deserve to be treated in the manner in which this nurse treated me. I was already suffering and  in pain and after being treated was feeling a little better to only leave the hospital in tears.",4

Every nurse and doctor I encountered did everything they could to make me feel comfortable and ease my nerves.

We couldn't see a hand specialist for 5 days because of a 3 day weekend, and there we learned that both fingers were broken, one needed to be reset.  Because it had been so long, the reset didn't work very well and surgery was required a week later.  I was very disappointed in the quality of care from Banner Gateway. Our copay was $150.

Absolute Garbage. Worst hospital I've ever witnessed in action.

My father fell and fractured his hip.

Day 1:
they withold my father from eating as they say hes going to have surgery that day
we keep asking, nurses have no idea when he's having surgery
lunch rolls around, dinner rolls around, still no food and still no surgery (He has low blood sugar, diabetes, and is 74)
at night they say they realize it wouldn't be able to happen that day, tell him and ask if he wants dinner (which took another hour to be delivered to him).
My mom took off work, which cut into her schedule and really screwed us over.

Day 2: surgery scheduled for 3 pm.
mom gets off work early, we get here at 2 and wait. (Granted I have school, she took off more time for work, and my dad's going without food again)

3 doctor rolls on in, states some genius had a hole in their glove and contaminated all the work equipment which would take an hour to fix. 4 pm rolls around. 5 pm rolls around. 6 pm rolls around. We ask every hour what in hell is going on, still receive no information - at 6, we finally learn that an emergency case came in and they used the room which they had prepped for my dad, and said it would be another 20 minutes.
6:30 rolls around. they come in tell us another 20 minutes.
7:15 rolls around. my dad is raging, and we're trying to calm him down but he hasn't eaten all day and is in a lot of pain - I don't blame him for being pissed at this horrendous system they call a hospital.
7:30 rolls around and they finally get him in, but I forgot to mention the nurses who all gathered his information all went home (boy lucky them) so we got some potato head genius's who roll in asking all the same questions, which just makes this situation feel even more smooth.
All in all, this is the biggest joke of a hospital experience I've witnessed.
If I was there for the first day, I would have had him transferred to another hospital.
Surprised my mother didn't. If I was there the first day, I would have probably exploded at the staff about how incompetent they were.

would not recommend anyone with a sick or injured family member to come here. we came here because it was closer, but next time will definitely tell ambulance or whoever to take the injured person out of their way to banner baywood or banner desert.

PROS:
- friendly nurse staff
-clean environment
-good hospital food

CONS:
-terrible communcation skills (Between staff and staff-to-patient)
-horrible bedside manner in shift transition (potato heads waltz in asking redudant questions with a cheeky smile on their face when we've waitied for days and are irate beyond belief. how about some communication if you don't feel like getting yelled at).
-awful time management and design scheme, how about we make patients wait for days when they have conditions that could put their life in danger if they don't eat.

so i told him.
So because he was a know it all, more less just stupid. he sent me to get a cat scan on my wrong body part. Then he had the nerve to ask why i told him about my other problem if i wasn't here for that. He should not be still working as Dr. since he has a memory worse than a fly. 
Then I had to get a new cat scan and he determined it was not broke.
This KOOk said my other hip could not be dislocated because it would have had to be fixed. what a dumb star fizz quirk. So i used the medical term hip dysplasia. he said O well thats different, not the same thing.

The entire department is self-enclosed, so unlike other banner hospitals, you must be buzzed in by a staff member. This gave me a sense of security during my stay there. They have a Japanese soaking tub, which unfortunately because my water broke prior to labor I was unable to use, but it sounded amazing. They have room service for the mothers and have a daily cookie service for anyone who happens to be in your room when they come by. They also have a nice courtyard for you to spend time in before and after your delivery. It was so nice to have somewhere to go outside after being cooped up in a room for a long time. 

The staff was so caring. I ended up needing a c-section and I was very scared and nervous about it, especially because my husband couldn't be in with me during the spinal. One of the nurses held me close and let me cry on her shoulder as I was getting the spinal and let me know everything was going to be ok. They made me feel so much better and didn't make me feel stupid for crying. They were very professional during the C-section and the recovery nurse was great with helping my husband tend to my son while the anesthesia was wearing off. 

My only complaint is that no one told us that the room service and food was apart of our overall bill until the second day we were there.

My surgery was scheduled for 10 am, and me being paranoid asked for one last ultrasound before they did the procedure. It backed up the surgery by over an hour, and although I could tell the doc wasnt too happy about it, he still let it happen, and the nurses were all understanding. I am happy I used this hospital, and my mom and husband who were there with me were impressed with how nice everyone was as well. The only thing that went wrong was they had to try 7 times with the iv to get it right, which left me pretty bruised up..they had to end up putting me under with a mask and then do an iv when I was out cold ...But that really wasnt their fault, I believe I was dehydrated.

I went in on the morning of June 27th and the triage nurses were horrible. I had maybe one that was helpful. They went ahead and sent me home being that I was not dilated enough. I came back around 4pm and the nurse finally admitted me. They took good care of me all the way until after my delivery. I sat in my filthy sheets for about 4 hours before they actually gave me a room. Also all the nurses treated me and my fiancee horribly for our entire stay. What should have been a beautiful experience and a happy time for our new family turned out to be a giant nightmare. For certain reasons I will not say, I was not helped in learning on how to breast feed my child. No would explain to why this was happening until I demanded to speak to someone of higher authority. And all because of this situation I was beyond stressed in a time where I should of have been filled with happiness. I WILL NEVER GO BACK  TO THIS HOSPITAL.

ALSO I forgot to add I had to deal with a social worker at this hospital and she was completely rude. Would not listen to me or my fiancee. She did not provide other parties involved in the situation with the correct information and she would not let me be released until she had made certain phone calls.

My daughter received services here and I was extremely impressed.  My daughter had surgery when she was 3 and we got some of the best care ever.  This is why I wanted to work there.  They came in to give her some morphine and even though she was 3 they listened to her concerns that the morphine made her head feel funny and that she didn't want it.  They called the doctor at midnight and got a new order for pain control.  That impressed me.  She currently goes to the pediatric clinic there and they take everything she says into consideration.

Knowing that, I can say with a clear conscious that a vast majority of employees in the dept I work with are passionate about kids. Take my bias as you will, but I can say if your child has been involved in a injury the place you should take your child is to PCH's Level 1 center.

Each experience has been positive - as far as any medical visit could be.   The waits haven't been long.  The staff has been courteous.  The followup has been great.   The facilities are gorgeous.   

I would add a couple of opportunities for improvement (which is why there is one star missing from this review).  First, I think that they should add the ability to send email confirmations for appointments.   (In the one instance, the hospital called to schedule an MRI while we were on vacation and I had no way to write down the appointment time.  When I asked if they could send me an email confirmation, they said they weren't set up to do that).   The second opportunity is with the main parking garage.  The security guards were ""quizzing"" us as to the purpose of our visit.   My husband and I were both perplexed as to the line of questioning.  I think they should coach the security staff to phrase the question better -- especially if it's meant to be helpful.

But anyway, a friend of mine in the medical field referred me to the Orthopaedics department, Dr. Greg White. It was difficult-VERY difficult trying to schedule an appointment over the phone and I found myself waiting for several minutes, becoming impatient and then calling back to try again. Well my relentless dialing paid off and I'm so glad. The hospital is so organized and streamlined in their processes, from the parking garage to the elevators, every step of the way, we were greeted, assisted and guided. They even have a automatic appointment confirmation call that reiterates directions and your apt time a couple of days before your set appointment. Onto the staff. I wish I could remember the names of all them, because each one was so helpful and patient. Adam gave ME a sucker because it was my birthday! And he had my son cracking up, anyone that has a kid knows how important it is that your kid is treated well!! The nurses that assisted with Scott's cast were great and very funny and sweet. Everyone genuinely seemed like they loved what they were doing and every kid that walked through the door. My son was probably the oldest the couple of times we were there, but there were some little kids, screaming and crying getting casts on and the staff never let out a sigh and just gently took care of all of them. I'd have to say Dr. White was my favorite part of the experience. From insisting that my son was going to get a pink cast because that was the only color they had, to cracking jokes about his monkey bar skills. He lightened the environment and we found ourselves laughing, smiling and having a good time in what could have been a very uncomfortable and scary situation. He explained every step of the process, he kept me informed and put my mind at ease when I would start to question or worry. He even told me that he would be doing the same thing if it were his own child's arm, which really helped me to feel at ease.

Scary for both of us but what impressed me was how organized the trauma team was. There were easily 15 people in the room working on him and it wasn't noisy or frantic. Everyone knew their role and carried it out. Dr. Segal set his broken leg and after 4 days in the hospital, he went home to heal. He's just fine now, thanks to the great care he received.

#2 son was also a patient in one of the clinics. While there was a wait to get an appointment, I think that speaks to the high demand for these specialty services. His case was very complex and I appreciated that docs from the various specialties worked together to treat him.

We have a teenage girl.  It's pretty silly that ""adult"" doctors won't see her until she's 18 because in every other way except the calendar she's an adult.  Fortunately they have a pediatric gynecologist here at PCH.  Her pediatrician recommended she come here to consult about occasionally-severe dysmenorrhea.  She said Dr Williamson was great, so we made the appointment.

Well, Dr Williamson was great.  She communicated very well with our daughter (communicating with a teen is an art form!), and was very thorough.  She asked lots of questions, did a lot of poking and feeling (""does this hurt?""), and then had her last blood-work forwarded to her office.  After examining the results she ordered the tests she felt were missing, wrote a prescription for hormone pills (low-dose oral contraceptive; in this case it should smooth-out the hormones to reduce or eliminate the 'cramps', will help with acne, and of course it will prevent pregnancy).  She spent a LOT of time with us.  None of that hurrying out the door nonsense you get with a lot of doctors.  She was great!

Then we were able to get the blood-draw and the prescription filled in the next-door building on the PCH campus.  So we were able to get everything taken care of in one trip.

I was super impressed with what I learned and saw during that visit and I became a fan back then even before I had children of my own.

The next two visits were more recent emergency visits with my son... One for Croup and the other for a night terror (of course I didn't know either diagnosis until after the fact).  Both times the lines to get in to see a doctor were rather long.  However, once we did get in, we were very happy with the level of service provided.  Courteous staff and attentive doctors and nurses.  We found them all to be patient as well, which is tough when you know they are constantly dealing with sick or injured children.

PCH has a reputation for being the best in Arizona for a reason... the name speaks for itself.
From the colorful curtains in each room to the movies playing on TVs throughout the lobbies and individual rooms, toys for children to play with as they wait to be seen, etc... They even offered my son stickers as we were leaving.  I am a fan of this place and I like knowing that it's nearby.  That being said, I hope that I won't have to visit PCH again ever.

1013945,zsDFRVGxHepj08WTgJrrCA,o5fU7Xpa8JBYF-Gz8kev8w,"My name is Melissa Diegel and I am the mother of 3 children.  I was once a small business owner and directed a successful preschool in Goodyear, Arizona for 5 years.  Looking back now, I realize that I once seemed to enjoy the regular American life.  However, running a business 24/7 was proving to be difficult as my children's health was declining and so I decided to close my business and focus more on my family.  Before I knew, it both of my daughters became critically ill both requiring feeding tubes, surgeries and bowel clean outs, because their colons did not want to work anymore.  Hannah my then 9 year old was having trouble walking, seeing and going to the bathroom and things were out of control!  It was in May of 2013 that the MRI showed a large brain cyst pushing on her brain stem.  Yes, you read that right!  I could not believe it now she needed brain surgery on top of everything else.

Nevertheless, that is not even, what this article is about.  You see if it ended, there that would be enough to our life story!

No, You are coming into our story when all hell has broken loose.  You see on April 8th 2014 the most horrific thing happened.  My little girls were taken away from me by the hospital and given to CPS.

Both girls were inpatient at Phoenix Children's Hospital and were being treated for bowel impactions. In March of 2014, I asked to replace Kayla (age 12) and Hannah's (age 10) Gi doctor after Hannah was suffering from home treatment complications and the GI doctor Dr Siaw chose not to return any calls.  While waiting for the hospital to replace that Gastroenterologist with a new doctor Hannah ended up in the Hospital again, this time with such a severe impaction her large and small intestine was so impacted liquid contents were coming out of her stomach the wrong way.  Unfortunately, the next day her newly fired GI doctor came on shift for a 7-day stretch.  As soon as the Hospitalist told me that, her fired GI refused to run any more tests and provide more than basic care for Hannah including nutrition I filed a formal complaint.  When all was said and done Hannah went approx. 22 days with minimal nutrition (like fasting) because of the medicine it took to clean out her colon. 

Approximately 2 weeks into the hospital stay I left the room to go get a soda for Kayla and was greeted by a social worker in the gift shop.  She then escorted me to a room in which there was an officer and several other people.  They took a statement and then said they were escorting me to my car and that if I came back to the hospital they would arrest me.   It was that day that I learned that that they were claiming I medically abused my child. 

I believe the doctor acted out of retaliation.  We also asked for a second opinion while inpatient they (the doctors and CPS) said no.  We asked to transfer hospitals our insurance said yes and the hospital said no.  Now my girls are stuck in the system and are being harmed.  The same doctor who ordered for the feeding tubes to be put in the one I fired has now ordered for it not to be used in Hannah.  In addition, Kayla was using hers just 12 hours a day instead of 24 hours.  I was just informed he has ordered for both girls to stop using their tubes and he wants them to be removed.  Both girls have a diagnosis of gastroparesis/ delayed gastric emptying confirmed by a nuclear scan.  The removal or non-use of these tubes could be life threatening.  No tests were done on the girls that would show suddenly why they would need to be removed.

In addition, a geneticist that had just recently transferred from Boston Children's Hospital to Phoenix Children's Hospital had recommended a series of tests be run on the girl's just weeks prior to the girls being ""taken.""  This coincidentally is the same hospital in which Justina Pelletier was held captive.  Some of the tests the geneticist wanted to do were for deletion syndrome along with a possible smooth muscle disorder connected to Kayla's C-2 deficiency.  He also suggested that some kids with mitochondrial disorder have a congenital disorder glycosylation.  Many other specific tests such as small bowel biopsies were recommended as well.

The staff are amazing and genuinely care about kids. The child life specialists are great with children and really know how to communicate. The doctors, surgeons, nurses, and other staff know how to explain procedures to kids in an understandable way without being condescending. The architecture and interior design are catered towards children, which makes it a colorful and fun filled hospital. I see kids in awe of all of the lights and sparkles everywhere! Also, the staff and volunteers always make sure to go the extra mile by providing coffee, toiletries, snacks, stuffed animals, and amazing care for both patients and their families. The cafeteria is also amazing. The food is fresh, reasonably priced, and there's also an incredible variety of cultures represented in the good. Compared to other hospitals I've seen, PCH has the most welcoming and friendly atmosphere. I hope to work at a hospital like this someday!",5

She was sweey enough tk ask the childrens hospital if they could allow us to come since we were missinformed. So I took my nephew in to see the neurologist at the children's hospital. It was so welcoming and clean. Although, the woman at the front desk seemed to of been having a bad day. My son wanted a sticker and he couldn't decide what he wanted and she said ""hurry up and pick one or I will choose one"" she seemed very impatient because it was onky a second it took him to decide she then counted 1..2..3. I pick. The dr he was very welcoming he explained everything that my nephew needed and how to help him. My son even enjoyed his time with the dr and he wasnt even being seen.",4

It is a relief to have a Dr. who shows the same level of concern for our kids health as we do.  We highly recommend this doctor!",5

1013951,klgWiMoWUytSvjpnZqhudQ,o5fU7Xpa8JBYF-Gz8kev8w,"We are outraged by the egregious mistreatment of the Diegel family, and have grave concerns regarding your facility's medical practices, in particular, your treatment, and lack thereof, for the young Diegel sisters, Kayla and Hannah, ages 10 and 12 respectively.

Your actions have resulted in these young children being removed and denied access from their parents, and put under the state's care where their medical and emotional needs are being seriously compromised and threatened.

Your actions of accusing the mother of ""medical abuse"", and reporting her to CPS for the same, put every potential patient of Phoenix Children's Hospital at risk of becoming a ward of the state for the inalienable right of requesting a second opinion that differs from yours.

You are, in effect, denying parents their most basic rights, i.e., to care for, love, and nurture their sick child, (EVEN VISIT THEM!), and you are violating Civil Rights irrefutably protected under the Constitution, from Parental rights to the denial of medical choice, access and advocacy.

While the Diegel's continue to be denied a second opinion, you've taken these young girls, at a critical time in their physical and emotional development, off of their feeding nutrition, denying the use of the very tubes your own specialists prescribed and ordered to be surgically implanted in them. This was done to enable each of them to absorb nutrition because their stomachs, again, determined by your own physicians, no longer function properly so that they receive adequate nutrition. The nuclear scans in the parents' possession, ordered by the same physician, offer proof of this, and show that Kayla and Hannah each developed GI issues that required these feeding tubes.

The girls are both losing weight. Kaya is at a dangerous, nearly 0 % body fat and has lost appropriately 25% of her body weight. Her sister has lost 17%+. They both exhibit bruises on their bodies which could be the result of physical abuse while they are in foster care, or an extreme vitamin deficiency. Whichever the reason, neither is acceptable. These children are suffering physically, and emotionally with every passing day. That you could allow this to continue another moment is reprehensible.

Your hospital took Hannah and Kayla fourteen months after Justina Pelletier was kidnapped under similar circumstances in the state of Massachusetts. The world watched as one media outlet after another picked up on this outrageous case, and public outrage boiled to the point of massive rallies to FREE JUSTINA. Congressmen and women alike took notice of this atrocity and proposed a bill named after her, JUSTINA's LAW, to stop just this sort of abuse and malpractice. A hospital of your ilk should have been quick to take heed of what has happened in Justina's case, the physical and emotional damage done to JUSTINA, and her family, and the public outrage, and stopped this abominable practice immediately.


It should not take a law, or public outrage for hospitals to do what's right, most especially since you are sworn to ""Do No Harm"". What you are doing to the Diegel sisters goes to the heart of what hospitals have been doing and getting away with, and what Justina's case has shown to the world, MUST STOP.

We demand the release of the Diegel sisters, and any other patients you have treated similarly, and that you retract your allegations of medical abuse from the state so that the children can go home to their loving family forthwith. A parent should be allowed to seek a second, even third medical opinion, and care without the threat of losing parental rights as is now happening to the Diegel's. We will petition Congress for their intervention in this matter since the proposed Justina's Law might not be passed before you literally starve these young children, and deny them of any comfort of their loving family along the way.

They worked quickly and with a tremendous amount of care and concern for my family's wellbeing. My son was diagnosed and given a care plan that put me at ease after feeling lost and frustrated when two prior dr visits failed to get us answers. Thanks especially to Dr Jared Muenzer, and all the nursing staff!",5

1013954,4F9w0bBOiMd4XSP6HxxpdQ,o5fU7Xpa8JBYF-Gz8kev8w,"My son was admitted after an ER visit and CT Scan revealed he had retropharyngeal abscess.  If not treated immediately this ailment can result in the airways being blocked and therefore suffocation can occur. I was given a visitors badge within seconds of arrival to the ER and my son (only 2) was already being checked out before I could even get the badge clipped on.  It was a blessing to have such timely care in a scary situation!  

The staff was 100% dedicated to my son's health and also my own comfort which I didn't expect but was grateful for!  We spent 5 days and 4 nights in the hospital and they did everything they could to make it as homey as possible.  Once my son was feeling up to it we even enjoyed long wagon rides through the facility.  I cannot speak highly enough of our care and treatment.  My son is back to his normal, ornery, sweet little self and I owe a lot of that to this hospital and staff.  Thank you!!!",5
1014695,bElulclyDWzwraLRpb_hnA,5pEYDbVmt2Il2TmUfckU6w,"We use their services at our office in Northern CA. They send a woman to give us our flu shots every year. Had no problems with payment or scheduling. The biggest problem is not crying when someone tries to put a needle in my arm. I try to tough it out, since I get my flu shot at work, and I don't want to appear weak with my coworkers around... but I usually end up asking to hold someone's hand.

They lose a star for not providing stickers and suckers to us when we're done; like my doctor does when I get a shot.",4
1014696,clCnT-TK9JDUnFG61QAAjg,5pEYDbVmt2Il2TmUfckU6w,Worst company ever!!! Do not use them..totally unreliable and unresponsive. Do not respond to phone calls or emails. Shocked they are still in business. Stay away!!! TB,1
1015338,7SKc_b19zKv43l0n1aNsoA,6G8FMxuYzz1ye4a386Rc_w,"This is a mixed bag of thoughts about my one and only experience with this hospital but I feel the need to vent my frustrations. 

I was scheduled for a cortisone injection into my hip joint, which is done under fluoroscope (X-ray). I was told the procedure would take about one hour and I was asked to not take any aspirin (blood thinner) for at least 24 hours prior to the appointment. My appointment was scheduled for 12:30 and my check-in time was noon. 

I've never been to this hospital before, so I double checked my directions online before I left the office. Well, the campus map is NOT accurate. Outpatient Radiology is located in a whole different area. And, the directional signs for the parking lot were lousy. The signage inside the hospital is even worse. I wasted about 20 minutes wandering before a lab tech was nice enough to walk me all the way over to where I needed to be on the OTHER side of the campus. 

When I did check in, I was told the procedure costs $2,000 and ""was I prepared to pay that now?"" Uh NO! Their computer system said someone attempted to contact me about their pre-payment policy but was unable to reach me due to an incorrect phone number. The admin person verified the number with me and it was correct. So since it appeared to be a mistake on their part, they let me just do a 10% deposit. Whatev. The pain was now moving from my hip to my pocketbook.

I also learned at check-in that my doctor had ordered some blood work, which usually took about 45 minutes to get the report. WTF? They got me in for the blood work pretty quickly but then I sat in the lobby for more than an hour. 

Eventually, I got back to the procedure room - two hours after my scheduled appointment time - and saw the doctor. He and the two technicians were very thorough. If I could review them separately, I would likely give them 4-5 stars. My injection went fine even though they had to do it without iodine because no one had relayed to them that I'm mildly allergic to shellfish. I do feel I received quality health care, and I realize that is the most important thing (or at least I've been trying to tell myself that). 

BTW, I tried to use their shuttle to get back to where my car was parked. The little bastard did a U-turn right in front of me and kept on going. So I got to walk about 1/2 mile back with a very odd feeling in my hip from the injection. 

And, I got back to the office at 4. Grrrrrrr.

If I'm referred to that facility in the future I will most definitely ask if there are other options.",2
1015339,mX63AXNbkDwBeGsyLwpvmw,6G8FMxuYzz1ye4a386Rc_w,"Great place for a c-section. After 14 hours of power labor, without an epidural, I was feeling pretty good about the hospital and it's maternity wing. When it was clear that major abdominal surgery was necessary to remove my bouncing baby girl (due to her bad position and lack of consistent heartbeat), I was greeted by several very friendly surgical staff and given general anesthesia. Ahh......6 Hours later, when I awoke, my husband was getting lessons from a nurse about caring for our baby and I was visited by a very knowledgeable lactation nurse to get me and the babe started on the all important feeding. 

The labor/delivery wing has about 30 rooms for birthing babies and on another floor they have c-section recovery rooms.  I began my stay in the maternity triage room then moved to an ultra-large labor/delivery room, and post-surgery had a 4-day stay in the cesarean wing. My baby was with me every single minute of my stay - all tests/vaccinations were performed on her in our room and I liked it that way. The drawback was there was no decent place for my husband to sleep...there is a window bench and a lounger-like chair.  Luckily, he can sleep in any position, so he did not complain.  Fussy dads may complain though.

The lactation support was phenomenal! As was the visit from the aesthetician who gave me an in-room facial (I'm a hippy that likes to be pampered).  They really did a great job of taking care of me and my daughter.

Now - a note about going through natural childbirth there - if you went through Bradley training like I did, then you'll know it's not thought of as a place to go drug-free during labor. In fact, it is better known for it's c-section rate.  They allow doulas, but don't really understand the need.  However, they were supportive of my request to walk around during my labor and take showers when I needed them. The nurses came in from time to time to ask that I stay in bed for 10 minutes or so for the fetal monitoring and she was quick to remove it once she got what she needed so I could move around. It helps to have a doctor that supports natural childbirth - I did not - since my doc was unavailable, I got an on-call doc he contracts with and she had the worst bedside manner possible. C'est la vie!

Oh - did I mention they fed me a grandma worthy Thanksgiving feast?  It was a great treat away from the green and red jello.",3
1015340,O8beHx1Ez10SBVlIHLc19w,6G8FMxuYzz1ye4a386Rc_w,"My daughter was visiting from Fairbanks, AK and her one year old twins came down with an upper respiratory flu type illness.  Because they are covered by Tri-Care, we were told to take them to the nearest hospital, which happened to be Scottsdale Healthcare.

I went with her to emergency, holding one of the twins.  We were promptly greeted by the front desk, and histories were taken.  They also took a blood test to see the oxygen content of the children's blood. After about a 15 minute wait for test results, we were seen by one of the emergency room physicians.  He discussed his findings with us in detail, the plus and minus of different treatment modalities, and his recommendations.  I am a healthcare professional, but my daughter isn't, and she had several questions, which he explained clearly and patiently.  

Also delightful was the person taking the insurance information (which did not happen until we were almost done).  He was personable, and obviously delighted with children, as he spent more time playing with them, than getting the information from my daughter.

It was a very pleasant experience, and it actually took less time for the emergency room visit, than to get their prescriptions filled.  I might note that it wasn't particularly busy that night, so it might be different if they are swamped.

Of course, I did manage to catch what the grandchildren had - aren't kids great!!",5
1015341,hHCdVWsxr27bPOcg2Mv6yw,6G8FMxuYzz1ye4a386Rc_w,"I delivered my son c-section here and the staff is great!  We loved all of our nurses save one and during a 4 day stay that's pretty good odds.  All the nurses help with breastfeeding for your visit and they are always happy to help with feedings no matter what time it is.  The way the food service works is awesome too, you can order off the TV with the remote control or over the phone from a huge menu and it's there within 45 minutes.  None of that ordering then waiting for the entire floor to be fed!  The one thing that was tough was there was no good place for my husband to sleep, it would have been nice if they had a reclining chair or something but he had a choice of a rocking chair or a padded bench.  I think another rater mentioned the same thing.  In general I would highly recommend this hospital to anyone but you have to be clear about your wishes if you don't want an epidural so they don't go in assuming you are going to have an IV.  I told my OB in advance and he let them know before I arrived.",4
1015342,88vXXnolVjnNF3Y04XxUEg,6G8FMxuYzz1ye4a386Rc_w,"Sadly, my mom fell down a wet grassy hill walking her dog on Monday night and broke her ankle in two places. Ouch! She was rushed to Scottsdale Healthcare North in an ambulance and texted me on the way to alert me of her injury. Let's just say I hopped in the car without blinking and drove up to Scottsdale from Tucson as quickly and safely as possible. 

When I first arrived at the hospital she was in a very small room, directly off of the ER waiting room. Seriously, I thought  this was a closet, no joke! Jay, the RN, came in several times to check her blood pressure, take her to get x-rays, etc. You know....the typical hospital drill when you break your ankle! Anyhoo, he was so kind, gentle and had my mom in stitches (no pun intended - HA!) with his witty jokes. I could tell my mom thoroughly enjoyed his company and care. He was so wonderful and really helped take the pressure off of what was going to happen next....surgery! 

Shout out to Jay...You are awesome and thank you so much for going above and beyond to take such great care of my mom!

After five LONG hours of being in the ER, my mom was moved to her own room on the Orthopedic floor...FINALLY! (Side note, all rooms at Scottsdale Healthcare North are single room occupancy. This is such a fabulous accommodation!!! That means no fighting over the remote or loud snores coming from the other patient.....YAY for mom!)

At this point I knew this was going to be a long night and an extensive journey. We arrived at her room (on the 5h Floor) and were pleasantly surprised by the immediate welcoming of the evening nurses. They quickly got her settled into her room and made sure she was comfy. The room was small but super clean so no complaints there. 

A little while later we were told that my mom was going to have surgery sometime in the early morning but didn't have a confirmed time. Let's just say we both too tired to care because by now it was going on 2AM! 

I left the hospital and headed to my mom's house for a few hours of sleep before I returned in the morning for her pending surgery. Got there around 8ish and still no surgery time. Ok, at this point my only complaint was the waiting and the unidentified time of her surgery. This seriously went on all day until finally at 6pm she was wheeled down to pre-op. Again, more waiting as the anesthesiologist had a crisis situation with another patient. At this time I was fortunate enough to meet Dr. Nelson who was performing the surgery on her ankle. My impression of Dr. Nelson was that he was very warm, compassionate and informative. He asked for my phone number and said he would call me directly after mom's surgery with an update.....and he did! 

An hour or so later my mom arrived back at her room from recovery. All went well and it was time for sleep. I returned the following day (Wednesday) and waited her release. Ugh, more waiting.  My mom was finally released Wednesday evening around 8pm with no problems or issues. YAY, we are going home. 

Overall, the experience at Scottsdale Healthcare North was pleasant and satisfying and I'm so thankful for their excellent and professional care with my mom! The doctors, nurses, physical therapists and aids were amazing, caring and extremely helpful. You can really tell these people are passionate about their job. Fabulous job Scottsdale Healthcare North!!!

I have mixed views on Scottsdale Shea.  My Dr. recommended them for my delivery hospital (I'm 7 months pregnant) but I ended up there a few months early because some loony Phoenix driver rear-ended me in rush hour traffic.  Even though the accident was in Tempe, I was freaking out so much and insisting on Shea that they took me there.  (My Dr office had said for me to go to Shea's OB Triage when I called, after the guy hit me.)  haha  

OB Triage was great.  After 5 hours monitoring my baby, I felt more calm.  I was in my own room and very comfortable... all of the staff was nice.  But then... I had to go to ER to have my accident concerns addressed.

ER was kinda crazy.  It was small, not laid out well and it didn't seem very efficient.  I was in their waiting room many additional hours even though I'd checked in with them earlier in the evening, they knew I was coming and I'd already been in the hospital for 5 hours.  There I was in a wheelchair, 6 months pregnant with a suppressed immune system... right next to other patients who were throwing-up constantly. haha  Oh well, hopefully I won't end up in their ER again... 

I'm looking forward to delivery in their amazing maternity ward!  I took a hospital tour a while back and sheesh... they have a great set-up for expectant mothers!  I get my own room and my baby will stay with me the whole time, even for his first bath!  They also said I have a jacuzzi that I can use to move around in during labor.  Hope that helps!

My most recent experience was when I needed to pull off the side of the road because I was feeling nauseous. Well after it passed, I decide to continue on to my office. In retrospect this was not such a great idea since my nauseousness became much worse, so I headed home. 

At the time I wasn't thinking it was anything more that an aggressive form of the flu coming on. Well I made it the 101, so I was half way home when I started to feel abdominal cramps that reminded me of kidney stones. 

I arrived at Scottsdale Health and there were a few folk in front of me, but I guess my plastic bag and the noises I was making pushed me to the front of the line. I was in the ER in about 15 minutes and seeing a doctor about 15 minutes after that. 

Don't get me wrong, the reason for the five stars isn't the speed in which I saw a medical professional, but how I was treated and the competence and professionalism of the staff -- because at one point I was screaming at the top of my lungs for a painkiller.

Forget that she was in distress before they did anything, forget that I was in a labor room the whole time, forget that my blood pressure dropped so low that my brother had to alert them that I was passing out. Those things can happen. But I can't forget that when I was feeding my daughter the nurse told me she is either eating a lot or you are bringing the food home. Nice comment, excuse me ""accusation"". I will never forget that when my bandage that they use to support the cut from the c-section was being replaced by myself in the bathroom, the nurse, or whoever she was repremanded me when I went to throw it away. She told me ""oh no, we wash them and re-use them"". I was mortified!. I told her, ""not on me we don't"" Ok, so I will forget all of that. This is the thing I will never forget.

All of that being said, I've seen my fair share of emergency rooms in the last few years, and for the most part, I've had decent experiences, even as the patient.  I've actually been to this Scottsdale Healthcare location three times already in the past eight months: twice for scares with the pregnancy and once for a breastfeeding class.  This is the hospital where my OB/GYN delivers, so naturally, this is where I'll be heading when Baby Mess is ready to enter the world... and I'm confident that I'll be in good hands when the time comes!

I've heard great things about the facility itself, especially the labor/delivery area, from other friends that have delivered here.  And from my experience to date, the staff has always been great as well.  Parking can be tricky, but they do offer complimentary parking during the week... and the breastfeeding class I took was very informative.

Bottom line: I don't think any hospital will ever be at the top of my list of ""fun places to hang-out,"" but if you or someone you know is in a situation where medical help / a hospital is needed, you can't go wrong with Scottsdale Healthcare.  Fingers crossed, I'll still feel this same way after I deliver this baby!",4

From the birthing classes to the delivery and the MOMs support group afterward, I've had amazing experiences from the staff and facility.  The only slightly negative comment I can offer would be the two triage nurses that we encountered after first arriving.  It was right before a shift change and I felt like the first nurse was annoyed we didn't wait 30 minutes before arriving so she didn't have to deal with us.  They also seemed annoyed that I preferred to wear a hospital gown I had purchase instead of the standard ones they were offering.  Even taking those two into consideration I'm grateful for the amazing experience every other staff member provided.  My labor was so long (lucky me) that I had two nurses once I was moved into the delivery room.  Nurse Amy and Nurse Robbie were the best support I could ever have imagined.  I won't consider delivering anywhere else but here for our next child.",5

My experience with labor and delivery at Scottsdale Healthcare Shea was top notch.  Everyone from the administrative people who I checked in with, to all of the doctors and nurses were amazing.  I went through 3 shifts of nurses during my labor/delivery, and they were fabulous!  My anesthesiologist was incredible too - thank goodness for that epidural!  And best of all, my OB/GYN was there for my actual delivery.  

Once Mav made his appearance, we stayed at the hospital another 48 hours or so, and all of the hospital staff we dealt with there were wonderful as well.  

One thing to note is that this hospital does not have a nursery.  Once your baby arrives, you are in the same room as the baby... nurses are there to help, but you can't just ""send the baby to the nursery,"" as I hear you can do at other hospitals.  I was sleep deprived, but I didn't mind this as I was able to bond with Maverick right away.

Other perks that I was impressed with were the size of the rooms, the fact that everything appeared clean and sanitized, the ""room service"" from the hospital cafeteria, the snacks available to patients, the videos available to help prepare you for being a parent, etc... but again, I cannot stress enough how impressed I was with the nurses.  Special kudos to Pam for getting me started and visiting after the baby came, Maggie for coaching me through the pushing, Cassie for her integral help post delivery, and all of the rest of the staff who I can't mention by name because I was in a drugged / hormonal state during my stay at this hospital.

I'm not a huge fan of hospitals in general, but again, I had a fabulous experience here and wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hospital to anyone.",5

The staff was rude and incompetent from the moment we walked in the door. The nurses acted like they were super annoyed anytime you needed anything. It took 6 of them to figure out how dilated I was which resulted in crazy amounts of pain and discomfort. 
It took forever to get into a room after waiting in labor 10 hours to finally have a planned c-section, and we were put in a holding room the first night. The room we were eventually put in was tiny and wasn't the one they had promised everyone when we took the tour and pre-registered. The food was horrible too. (yes, I'm aware hospitals food is never that decent!) 
This was supposed to be one of the most amazing experiences of my life and it was a complete nightmare. You're way better off at Desert Banner which is where we always have gone after this experience.
Thank god for a great on-call surgeon (wouldn't you know my wonderful doctor went out of town that weekend) and a great team + anesthesiologist who made my birthing experience somewhat decent. Otherwise this place is horrible and I will avoid it like the plague. Please think before using their maternity services!!",1

In fact, the staff was a little concerned that she wasn't calling them about every little concern that might affect her after having her second c section.  Having quite a lot of  prior experience with hospitals, getting five stars from me isn't all that easy but all went just that well today.

My medical records were lost, I tried to warn the nurse that my veins roll and aren't happy with needles, she didn't care - until it happened to her. Then she wanted to hear all about what I had to say about which arm works better and why. A random nurse walked around telling everyone she was lost and didn't know where she was. Which again, 20 minutes before I am to go into Surgery was the LAST thing I wanted on my mind!! My medical record was eventually found - in recovery - however I was still I pre-op. they all laughed it off, I freaked out! One of the doctors on my team made it a point to tell everyone she had never worked with my surgeon before and she had no idea who she was looking for. I could go on and on. Why am I writing all of this? Because as a patient I shouldn't have had to hear ANY of this. I was more stressed going in, hoping the right procedure was being done with the right doctors than anything leading up to my surgery. 

The plus side. Private rooms, food delivered around the clock, and the volunteers that gave us a mini tour when I checked in. Otherwise, I'll stick to Del Web from here on out.

Not all hospitals can say that.

I am glad they get along well (better than being hostile in a work environment!) -- but I was trying to sleep.

Notes - 
The place is huge - if you go, wear comfortable shoes - you're gonna do a LOT of walking.
Foodservice in the cafeteria SUCKS since Aramark took over. I really haven't had any food that actually tastes like food (salad bar included.) If you can, eat somewhere else.

The whole experience from the initial tour, to the pregnancy/newborn classes, to registration, to labor, to delivery, to checkout, was top notch.  Every one of the hospital's staff we came in contact with was professional, friendly, courteous, and experienced.  I would recommend this hospital to anyone having a baby.

I do, however, have 2 negative comments:

1 - the room service food is not very good and is ridiculously expensive.  I would give the food like 2 yelp stars.

2 - They seriously need to reconsider the accommodations given husbands (or anybody else staying with a person during labor/delivery).  I have never been more uncomfortable in my life.  The people here can save lives but can't figure out how to procure a comfortable sleeping apparatus (cot, roll-away, etc.) to put in the rooms.  It is all a blur now and all I can remember was a recliner and some other small chair that somehow turned into an awful ""bed""

I was in an accident on Friday morning an taken here. I'm still pretty new to az and haven't had the need to visit a hospital so they took me to whatever was closest. 

Having no opinion or knowledge is hard especially during times of trama. The people on the ambulance were great and worked quickly to make sure I was safe and comfortable. I'm not sure if they work for the hospital, chances are they don't, but they deserve a shout out. 

So I was brought in for the accident and treated right away. One time back in MA I was in an accident and had to wait about 45 to get treated. This time around I had the paramedics with me, the nurses and the doctors. The doctor came in and held my hand and talked me thru everything. It was really comforting since my parents or boyfriend hadn't arrived yet. 

The x-ray techs too, their time and I know they were just doing their job but I was in a lot of pain and really uncomfortable. I wish they gave me at least Advil or something when I had to get that done. I'm not a big pain pill person but it might have been necessary at that point. 

Anyway I was in and out pretty quick with a ton of swelling and bruising but nothing broken. I think the staff did great and even boyfriend commented on how nice of a hospital that was.

Flashback a couple months, when I had a high fever with some odd symptoms (blue splotchy skin?).  My doc took one look at me and told me to go straight to the E.R.

So of course I didn't. I went home, packed a little bag w/ a few essentials, and thought about where I might want to be stuck for 2 or 3 nights (cuz I knew I was going to be admitted). Although I've been a patient w/ excellent care at St. Joes, I selected Scottsdale Shea because it was so nice when I had a 3 day stay after surgery a few years back, and the E.R. wasn't as busy (you can see wait times for their E.R. at http://fastertimes.org/ )

I get there a couple hours later, they triage me fast, and after about 30 minutes in waiting area, they got me back to E.R. Quickly looked me over, brought in the right people, tests ordered, fast process overall and in 2.5 hours I was in my own room.

13 days, folks. That's how long I was there.  That's a long time (to me, anyway). EVERYONE who cared for me was awesome- the nursing staff (RNs, NAs)  was attentive, competent, friendly, never waited for any meds.  If something was wrong, they listened and took me seriously and followed through with testing, etc.  My treatment was explained to me by the several doctors that were following my case.  In addition, I had much of the same staff again and again, so that really helped.

Other details: my room was very clean, the nursing staff did their best to protect my sleeping (no throwing on bright lights, etc). 

Food: you do get to select/order your own food unless you have some special restriction in place. Food is OK for say, 2-3 days, but after that I was done w/ boring Aramark hospital food.

I delivered our son here in February and was very nervous as I am from the UK everyone at home has their baby delivered by a midwife at a hospital with barely any intervention at all. I didn't even really know what an OBGYN was before I moved to the states!

Looking into it, I had two options here in Scottsdale; go to a birthing center and then transfer to a hospital if there is an emergency, or go to a hospital and risk unnecessary medical interventions. This was very scary. I knew that I wanted a natural birth and labor, but from hearing about the 96% epidural rate at this place was not sure that it was the place to go. The idea of a birthing center seemed more like the experience I wanted but with this being my first baby and my family being 1000's miles away, I opted to go to Scottsdale Shea.

I can only say that I was so pleasantly surprised. The birthing classes are certainly steered towards epidurals and drugs and most of the women at the classes seemed keen to hear about what drugs they could take and when, which was great for them, as each to their own. I had to dig a little deeper and ask a few more questions to the instructor during the break. 
Whilst the breathing exercises seemed silly at the time, my husband encouraged me to practice them everyday, and when I went into labor they seemed like second nature!

I was able to deliver a 7lb 3oz baby at Scottsdale Shea completely naturally with only a small tear. I did take a few Tylenol afterwards for the next three weeks, but that was fine with me!

The staff were very encouraging and supportive, if a little curious about how I wanted to breath and swear through it, but I am so glad that I went there. Baby was perfectly healthy and took only 6 hours to arrive.

Two small (tiny) criticisms - there was no shower gel, don't forget yours as you will really really want to shower! and as a previous yelper wrote, the bed for my husband was terrible! expect for your partner to get no sleep what so ever!

I went there for a simple UTI, i was pretty much the only patient there, yet it took them over 2 hours to test my urine for bacteria while i got to sit there in pain waiting.  After all of that, i got charged $2000.  For a simple UTI, really?!  They didnt even give me antibiotics and pain relievers to hold me off til I got my prescriptions.  On top of that, i had a flareup 2 days later so i went to a clinic by me and the doc there told me i was given the wrong antibiotics so i was given new ones by the clinic.  Guess what?  It gets even better.  I kept calling st lukes to see when they were going to send me my bill so that i could pay it off and when they finally did, it said ""final notice"" so i paid it instantly online.  The next day i get a phone call from them saying i didnt pay them.  Really?!  I had them check their records and they found that i did in fact pay it.

Apparently it has a reputation and I can tell you IT IS WELL DESERVED. I arrived in an ambulance with extreme abdominal pain, ten on a scale from one to ten. We had been told other hospitals were turning ambulances away because they were so busy, which is why we came to this one. This ER was busy as well, but that is still no excuse for the horrible care I received. I was left for two hours without anyone checking on me ONCE when I first got there. When they finally did see to us, we had to constantly beg for nausea medication, pain medication, blankets, and information again and again before anyone would help us. They didn't have several basic medical supplies. There was gauze soaked in somebody else's blood when I arrived to my room and it stayed there on the floor the entire time I was there. It turns out I had to have an emergency surgery to remove an ovary, a very traumatic procedure for someone as young as me. There was no support system, no comfort, no understanding from the staff, only rudeness. Now, to be fair, the staff the morning of my surgery and the night after my surgery were kind and appeared to be trying and the people who were involved during the surgery and its prep seemed ok and competent, but somebody misread my ultrasound or CT scan and almost caused major complications during the surgery. My last nurse was the worst of them all. She was impossible to get ahold of and other nurses and students kept having to cover for her. I kept hearing people wondering where she was and others replying that she was on break again. When she did come in response to my pressing the call button, she was extremely rude, mean, and condescending.  She looked at me like I was crazy when I asked for aftercare instructions and told me just to ""rest up""! I kept having to ask her again and again to call my surgeon for the post op instructions and to answer some questions I had. She kept insinuating that I should leave and there was no reason for me to still be there and I kept having to explain to her that I was waiting on her to call the surgeon. She was so inattentive and rude! When I was finally ready to go, she had a clumsy and inexperienced student take out my IV even though I had previously explained that I was not good with needles, probably as a repayment for pressing the nurse call button the ridiculously amount of ONCE or TWICE an HOUR! Usually to ask for something I had already asked for and not received! Just a horrible hospital full of extremely rude, incompetent people who don't care a whit!",1

Besides having the best knee replaceement surgeon, he was treated well and nursing and PT staff were  attentive to his needs.  In fact they were even attentive to mine - his nurse even gave me a pillow!  I have visited hospitals all over the world and none compares to St. Lukes.  Patient food is good and cafeteria food is fantastic!  Pork tenderloin with figs in a sauce and wonderfully seasoned jasmine rice - outstanding.  I texted my children that we were being treated like visiting dignitaries...they stopped worrying when they heard that.  I will do anything possible to return to St Lukes for any procedure needed in the future.",5
1019384,vQm5RAf-ZxTDfCJX9oPCwg,DbU6jDGRB5-z-W_nzK2OiQ,"My wife and I were on vacation when she had a seizure in the airport and EMS took us to St. Luke's because it is so close (I'm guessing). If we had just been in the ER I would give this place a FIVE STAR. The ER staff were all so friendly and courteous to my wife and myself. We have been in several hospitals before and no place has ever been so kind and caring especially for myself who waits by the bedside the whole time. Rebecca, Colleen, and Lee Asked me several times if the patient needed anything, made sure she had blankets to stay warm and made sure she had pain medicine for the after care from the seizure and fall. They even brought me water and made sure I ate a meal even after I refused so I could stay in the room! The ER definitely went out of their way to make us feel like we were being taken care of....

UNFORTUNATELY, as soon as my wife was admitted and taken upstairs to be further evaluated overnight the care totally flipped and turned for the worse. The nurses were not friendly, very short with us and showed no kindness. We had to ask several times what was even going on and why she wasn't getting medication. When the neurologist came in, he never mentioned anything about taking my wife off pain medicine or anything and that is when things got even worse. He prescribed her with a new seizure medication, that turns out the hospital doesn't even carry! So my wife went the whole night without seizure medication. The doctors said they just wanted to release her.... Because of the lack of medicine she ended up having one more seizure! The nurses told us the heart monitor and video surveillance they use to monitor seizure patients would tell them she was having a seizure, but i was the one who had to run out and tell them more than halfway through the seizure (I stayed by her side thinking they would be alerted and come in). They came in to the room only to leave right after. I noticed the heart monitor cables had come off during the seizure so I let one of the nurses know and they said they would come back in. Over 30 minutes passed and during that time I had to find someone in the hallways to find me a puke bucket and help get her situated again in bed (thank you male nurse not assigned to my wife's room). It wasn't until I hung up with Patient Relations(PR) that a CNA came in to help put the heart monitor back in place and working properly and that vital signs were taken. The PR came up and that's when the day doctor finally came in to see the patient. She let us know that she is following the neuros notes and that my wife wasn't even prescribed meds for seizures. She proceeded to pull me out of the room to tell me the nephrologist believes my wife is either attention seeking or wanting drugs and the seizures are fake!!!!! You can imagined frustration and outrage of this comment and what any person would do for their loved one hurting.... For the next two hours I argued and fought for patient rights and even asked for a new doctor. It was then THE DOCTOR CAME BACK AND ADMITTED SHE READ THE PATIENTS CHART WRONG AND THAT THE NEURO PRESCRIBED SEIZURE MEDS AND WHAT SHE SAID WAS WRONG!!!! THIS MEANS THE DOCTOR LIED AND NEVER EVEN HAD A CONVERSATION WITH THE NEUROLOGIST!!!! Even after we asked for a new doctor the hospital never gave us a new one and I even told them that if they weren't going to given wife proper care to just give us the same medication she was previously on so we could get home. They refused still. The nurse finally came in and took the IVs out but then walked out without a word. We were left  in there for ten minutes before we decided that we couldn't take any more and since she had all tubes out we should just leave. Mind you the hospital did not leave us with any prescriptions or anything even after three seizures in 24 hours!!! Never ever EVER EVER go to this hospital whether you live here or are going on vacation. They do not respect the patients or give them any rights!!!! They have no bedside manor, no empathy. These people should not be in the health care field, nor do they care about the people, it is all about money to these heartless greedy people.",1

The ER team was nice but quite unorganized. It took them 5 hours to transfer her out of ER and admitted to the hospital. After another seven hours the team on the floor still did not have her test results from ER. But they sure as Hell made it a priority to get her gall bladder surgery scheduled for the afternoon - yes, without the test results.

Quality of care seriously depends on who's on shift and what floor you're on.  Cath-Lab and ICU staff has always been fantastic, but staff on the 7th floor is a hit or a miss.  Likewise with staff in the ER.

1019388,cK0OrTGL6b4F6nY2u1Onrw,DbU6jDGRB5-z-W_nzK2OiQ,"I was very happy with the services I received here for two procedures. I also had a surgery here this past Friday and I was very well cared for by all. I was treated with great respect and had outstanding customer service from the Nurse Anesthesiologist Justin. Justin really listened to my concerns and solved any issues that could arise from side effects. He was also very kind and friendly. He could sense I was a bit scared and was a calming soul. I had a prior bad experience with surgery Anesthesia so was very nervous. I credit Justin with almost no side effects from this round of Anesthesia. Diane in PreOp and Agnes (I think that was her name) were also very caring souls. I just adore nurses.  

The one and only bit of advice I could give is that the Recovery Room stay should be longer in my opinion. I am not sure why they kick you out so fast. Wave of the times I suppose. It did not seem that busy but maybe they needed the bed. That worries me a bit since I had challenges getting home. I think it would have been better to let me stay a few more hours. They literally had me dressed and out the door in about 40 minutes after surgery. The Recovery Room nurse was a bit gruff. I really can not say anything bad about her but she is not as out-goingly caring as the Pre-Op folks. Of course if I had to choose I guess I would pick the warmer fuzzy folks first for calming effects prior to surgery rather than after. However, both are important and have purpose and reason.

Thanks to all the staff for taking such great care of me.",4

Cef and his rehab group helped my little sister in her struggle to regain her motor skills after her stroke at a young age.  However, we had some issues with some of the nursing staff and had to demand my sister get another nurse one evening. It was taken care of right away but should not have happened to begin with. They do have some really caring charge nurses and CNAs though.  Some CNAs need more training on how to deal with specifically with stroke patients, especially on transfers and bed mobility. You cannot ask someone who is still recovering from a stroke to just stand-up or roll in bed when they can't move half their body.  In some cases, they don't even realize half of their body is their because 
of hemineglect from the stroke!!!

Thank God I have a healthcare professional background or else my sister would've been sent home and not continue her rehab as she so badly needed.

If you have the unfortunate opportunity of ending up there then you better know exactly what is wrong with you because I can assure the doctors have little chance of finding out. If your head is missing it will be days before they find out and in that time you will likely be treated for low blood pressure. NOTE: The most competent people were the Air Force personnel. 

I had to go to the Emergency Room. I specifically told the doctor what was wrong and he ignored it and treated me for something else. The problem that was causing severe pain was not treated and I was not offered any pain medicine. 6 hours later I thought I was being punk'd and reminded the doctor why I came in. He had completely forgotten! This guy examined me, took blood samples, saw obvious signs of past trauma and then forgot.

Up until I got married and put on Tricare I had only step foot in one hospital a LONG time ago and only been to UMC Quickcares because I had no health insurance.

The hospital itself is expansive and takes some getting used to to navigate. I've only been to Family Medicine for womanly checkups and of course, to the pharmacy to pick up prescriptions from said visits. I have also been in the ER because my father had to take a trip out there (by his own insistence) while he was in Vegas over a holiday. Being high ranking he got superior treatment to any treatment I or my husband has ever gotten (my husband doesn't speak too highly of this facility).

Of course, since I'm basing off my experiences it's been okay, nothing spectacular and nothing to make me stop going (as if I had a choice). Medical care is hard to come by these days and I thank my lucky stars I can get seen for free and get meds for free, even though I do have to plan my appointments out 6 months in advance, and yes, I DO plan my appointments about 4-6 months out because if I don't I won't get an appointment when I want one.

Of course tri-care doesn't make it super easy to change PCM's so I have yet to get a new one. Thankfully I haven't required any treatment as of late.

The ER can at times be either really great or really awful. Sometimes it feels like they just want to get you in and out as quick as possible without giving the full care we deserve. Sometimes it's great and they give awesome care, like when I had to take my daughter in for a nickle being caught in her throat. In the beginning I had to give a Maj. an ear full before something happened, once things were set into motion they did a great job and were quick to help her.

I hate that it takes what seems like forever to get appointments forcing you into the ER sometimes. As a result it backs up the ER and you can end up in there for several hours so be prepared.

1041631,5Bx9oJq3578cbAAKxu8tuw,9hVzaBp2yjSWX04GGA0Yqw,I've had so many frustrations and problems with this hospital that I would appear obsessive if I tried to list them all.  The bottom line is that they are incompetent. There is little communication between offices and the staff appear to have no incentive to help their patients. The icing on the cake for me was when a Dr. wrote off a tumor as glitch in the MRI--without doing any additional testing or looking at my medical history.,1
1041632,kXfCQsOp5Y_CcPTf3J5VCw,9hVzaBp2yjSWX04GGA0Yqw,"Out of my husband's six years in the Army I have been to three hospitals...Two were army hospitals and the third one would be Mike O. I have to say I expected much more since it is the Air Force but I was smacked with reality..lets just say I miss my army hospital dearly lol.  This hospital has potential but I think the fact that it is a learning hospital ruins it for me. Don't get me wrong I understand we all have to start from some where but geeze! For instance, I had an appointment with my PCM and an intern was handling the beginning of the appointment and all he did was flirt/make googly eyes! Seriously?! One I am married, two I am pregnant, and not to mention I am a patient! Lets just say it was not the last time this has happened. 

As for the OBGYN I have mixed feelings. I am already nervous about my unborn child and interns don't exactly make me feel assured that everything is alright. Since being put under high risk though I do feel much better. Why? Well because I am seeing a doctor with real experience now. One thing I do like about the OB is that the doctors are very precautions about anything that may seem off. So it's nice to know that they take things very seriously. 

Like I said the hospital has potential it's just all the students who make me feel uneasy.",3
1041633,k7LCk31W5OjVG5CeVSUnuw,9hVzaBp2yjSWX04GGA0Yqw,"I've been here a few times now. We have been to the ER, dentistry, our PCM, optometry, and the immunizations clinic. Overall, I am highly satisfied with our experiences.

ER-3/5
-My husband was seen less than 10 minutes of arriving and had his X-rays etc. done right away. The only downside was the long wait we had to be seen again before leaving. We spent at least half our day in the waiting room just to get the X-ray results and my husbands leg wrapped up. Overall a mediocre experience, I don't know if I'd come here for an urgent emergency.

DENTAL-3/5
-My husband came in to get his wisdom teeth removed. I sat around waiting a looooong time to pick him up downstairs. When it was finally time, they sent me down to pick him up...when I got there they had the wrong person waiting for me in a wheel chair. Whoops!....I had to park and wait about five minutes since my husband was about to really be brought down anyways. He did finally come out :P so there's minus 1 point. Minus another point because my husband has had reschedules quite a few times, at least four, in a two month period for the same appointment.

PRIMARY CARE-5/5
-Our PCM is Dr. Harris. She is awesome! Very professional, attentive, helpful, and really eager to help you in every possible way. We saw her for the first time when my husband sprained his ankle and needed a profile done. I saw her recently for a women's health evaluation and high blood pressure concerns. She was very thorough and addressed every concern I had. I think we really hit the jackpot with her :P because I've heard not so pleasant reviews about other PCMs here.

OPTOMETRY-4/5
-1star deduction because you have to schedule an appointment one month prior to actually coming in, they're really busy! Besides that though, everything else is great. They have all the latest technology that most private optometrist would not have. I had Dr Helman for my visit, he was very thorough with my visit. I had my eyes dilated and was informed my eyes grew in a bit longer than usual. He informed me on the risks that may come along in the future related to that and what I will 'see' if it ever happens and what would need to be done. I've had my eyes dilated before at different optometries and never once did anyone inform me of the abnormality! I will definitely be back again next year for my annual eye exam.

IMMUNIZATIONS CLINIC-5/5
-I've never had to wait more than two minutes for my walk-ins. Quick, fast, and easy!",4
1041634,6TMEW4-f0RDWqSv5hIlHOw,9hVzaBp2yjSWX04GGA0Yqw,"I don't know if there has been a lack of healthcare professionals entering the military over the past few years or what, but I'm starting to see more contractors (who probably don't even have to do all that physical fitness stuff like the rest) here than doctors with the gold leafs on their work clothes.

The pediatrician I used to have before I became legal enough to have a less annoying doctor was this fat, civilian woman who looked more like she belonged in the school nurse setting than a federal hospital. IMHO she was incompetent to the point of giving me meds that didn't work or that I didn't need in the first place. I had the typical zits and blackheads that nearly every teen goes through in their high school days, but I was prescribed this acne medicine that made my skin worse and dry. After that, I went back to just using regular facial/blemish cleansers that you buy at the commissary.

When I turned 18, I refreshingly got a new family physician. She seemed to be an intern or whatever, because she said that she needed to check with her higher-up how doing physical check-ups go for those who needed to get all of that done for ROTC. Let me tell you: any intern that works here are more likely to know their way around military culture than those who didn't go to COT or did the HPSP (Health Professions Scholarship Program). So my experience with her was better that the previous doc I had.

Waiting times are pretty average, but it's tricky to set up an appointment early because so many are calling in for one. So if you wanna get checked-up, call for an appointment at least two months before.

Tech got fancier over the years - now there's even a small coffee place near the lab/prescripton/radiology area. Well then; seems like the Air Force is putting its budget to decent use.

I've only been to two other big military hospitals in my life, and I'm too young to remember how they compare to the one here at Nellis. I'll say it's prett much a decent hospital.",4
1041635,Ur8iKZpADN1WsDcOzKsJyg,9hVzaBp2yjSWX04GGA0Yqw,By far the worst care my baby and I have received. You cannot get an appointment with peds to save your life and when you do it's 2 months out at least. I've taken my son now twice to the immunization clinic to get his 6 month vaccines and each time they have been out of the vaccines he needs and has no idea when they will have it. Both times we have gone to the ER nobody has a clue as to what's wrong with us after being there 6 hours. And if you're going to the pharmacy plan for an all day trip. Seriously try to get referred off base because this place is a joke.,1
1041636,6eB9KSYO_MU4WFl1dKmQhg,9hVzaBp2yjSWX04GGA0Yqw,"I believe this hospital and ER has been instructed to treat as little as possible,  and to make it SO difficult to be  seen that you give up and go home. While you wait - in the ER, you hear the staff complain. About hours. About patients. About how tired they are.  The doctors are jerks.  Regardless of what you know about your condition? In 5 seconds the doctor knows more than you AND your previous doctors combined. 

How about this Nellis AFB? Instead of another food court full of fast  
Food for Fattys &  toxic GMO industrial farmed food? Get rid of ALL the food court and open 
That space up to an urgent care clinic?? Run by people in the business of providing care??  Who like their jobs? 

We can't get appointments when we're sick, the nurse won't
Get anyone  a referral to be seen off base when the clinic is booked two
Weeks out and the ER doesn't 
Want us in there and doesn't treat appropriately. 

Are you trying to kill us??? 


Here are my lovely experiences with Nellis AFB medical Clinic & ER: 

1: clinic: I checked in as new to base.  The  paperwork  asked: ""why are you here?"" 
And ""list your medical problems."" 

Who knew the doctor could only handle 1 problem per appointment.  So while I'd listed asthma, arthritis, lap band follow up, menopause, thyroid"" like their paperwork asked? Apparently I got it wrong. In the hallway- this doctor started yelling: ""just who does she think she is coming in here with all this?!!  Then he proceeded to go on a rant related to lap band-- at which point I  went out into the hallway and asked him if he was referring to my chart?  He said yes. I then read him the riot act about privacy and HIPPA and asked him who he thought he was to stand out in a hallway and run down a patient where everyone in gods  name could hear him and  asked if he had he lost his mind?  Then I jerked my file out of his hands, called him an asshat and told him ""thanks but no thanks"" -- then I went straight to the  medical group commanders office and Tri Care and then patient advocacy.  

.

ER: 
1:  Went to ER  concerned about 1 inch weeping gash hot spot  from a hiking fall on front shin bone 
And  ankle pain. I was given  an X-ray that apparently no one read and a  corset type
Brace to lace up and squeeze over my infected leg. Was told to stay off leg
And foot. 
Went back 3 weeks later, and it's all worse. My entire center
Leg bone is red and hot to the touch and still weeping. 
Well of course it's worse I've had a fractured ankle the
Entire time AND a bone infection. 
They are not going to script me for antibiotics because
""Everyone abuses and over uses them"" to which I say: 
I've been off my leg for nearly a month, you misdiagnosed 
A fracture, I seriously do not want to come back in here to have this 
Bone scraped down at my age... I'm not some toddler with sniffles. This IS serious."" 
Then they DC me to home. I ask... What about my fractured ankle? It's still swollen 3 times it's normal size....
""Oh, continue to stay off it."" 
Seriously??? Finally I tell them if the USAF can't afford a flipping
Immobilizer boot to write a script for one and I'll go buy one. 
At this? They sent me to orthopedics to get a boot. 
It took 4.5 months to heal this 6 week problem due to their 
Apparent orders to discourage treatment if at all possible. 

ER: 2 Went in with kidney stones. Dr  argued with me I'd pulled
A muscle in my back. I've had stones before.... Like I'd make this up? 

He discharged me with flexeril and back exercises. I went home 
Passed the stones, put them in an envelope and took them back
To him at the ER with a note: Here's The pulled muscle in my back.Thank
You for ALL your help.""

ER 3:  was there for flu, dehydration  which they did not treat. It turned into pneumonia  I privately paid a real doctor to treat.  While there , a confused elderly  vet came in completely disoriented  believing he had an appointment.  He had urinated the front of his pants. He was unstable on his feet.  The man  in my opinion as a geriatric social worker  - was  likely  in the middle of a manic episode  or off his meds for a psyche. Diagnosis. The staff, even the doctors  who spoke with this man who  obviously did not need to be  driving , did not intervene  or call APS  to assist him and help get him home or the police. He was threatening to kill himself  by the end of his time in the ER because  he had been told and had an appointment card 
And when he showed up they said he was wrong even tho the card he had did say his appointment  was that day.  The ER  called his clinic  who said they had cnx'd his appointment  and he  just went off the wall.   The bad part is?  The ER  Staff  let this man go and get behind the wheel of his car when he couldn't  barely string a sentence  together or walk. 

I guess as long as they weren't out on the highway with him they didn't care.

1041640,SDF_3UFvt97TW8QWKkcd1g,9hVzaBp2yjSWX04GGA0Yqw,"In general, I would say this is an average military medical center. The Emergency Room is treated more as an urgent care clinic than an ""emergency"" room, however. They have a system that includes a ""fast track"" for non-emergent quick fixes.... This includes a 3-bed area where those deemed quick fixes can be in and out as quickly as possible. That's great and all unless you have a more serious issue and you're being held up waiting and watching several people who came in after you waltz in and out in no time... We waited in the waiting room for 6 hours for our 6-month-old with a 104 temp to be seen by a Doctor. I would have understood the wait more if we didn't watch about 20 people who came in after us get treated and leave before we were even taken back. Also, once we were finally back, our daughter was barely given a 2-minute checkup. Just a little frustrating... Something is wrong with this overall picture. 

Labor and delivery would get 4 stars... They lost a star when they failed to get me out of my stinky, dirty L&D room and into a post partum room in a timely manner. If it weren't for my mom being there, I would have been lying in gross birthing fluids the entire NINE (9) hour wait for our room. And no, they weren't backed up. We finally got a room when we had visitors come. I wish they would have come sooner!!! Maybe they would have moved me sooner?! 

Other than that, labs and pharmacy are your average long waits you'd expect.",3

Last year we took our little kitty, Kyoto, to get spayed at the Spay and Neuter Center. We were so pleased with the place because they had just opened, center was immaculate and staff was friendly.

This year both of our cats needed their rabies shot and immediately we felt compelled to take them to our new found place.

Ay yay yay!  A lot can happen in less than a year! First of all, when we walked into the center everything was different. The interiors is the same but everything else was disarrayed!

The front desk clerk did not know what she was doing.  She was constantly answering calls and questions from callers. The clerk's comments and suggestions were inappropriate and made herself look like a ""nincompoop"" to customers.  In addition, she didn't even know how to look at our kittie's charts. She suggested to give our cats all of these shots that they didn't even need! Because if she knew how to read their charts correctly, then she would have known that one of the shots she was offering our cats already had from the previous visit!

We were flabbergasted when they planned on to taking our cats away from our hands to the back in their ""procedure room"" where we can't even watch if the needles are sterile and not be there to comfort our pets! That is the most insane thing that we have ever heard!!!  So we requested to talk to the Vet ourselves so we can request to go in the back with our pets.

Are you ready for this? So, the Vet comes out and she presented herself as if she was atrocious!!!  Her appearance made us feel very uncomfortable and embedded negative thoughts in our minds.

The look in her eyes and her presence scared us to death that as soon as she began speaking about how it is her policy to take the animals to the back without the owners being present.....we bolted out of there like Mr. and Mrs. Speedy Gonzalez with our cats in their tote bags.... mmmmwweeeoooonngggg!!! (or however the sound of speed goes)

Then take your four-legged family member to the Spay and Neuter Center of Southern Nevada! We love this place and don't go any where else for our pup's needs even if it is across town. 

Their prices are the best in town, Dr. Brazil is very knowledgeable and genuinely cares about your pet. There's usually a little bit of a wait and yea, the phones are constantly off the hook and even when you're the caller, you're put on hold for awhile, but that's because there is a lot of interest in this location due to their great rates. 

COMPARISON: (based on our visits since November 2009)
~Banfield (Inside PetSmart): $34.99 for an exam (required for any procedure) $15-$30 per shot, $25+ Microchip not sure if it includes the first year of reg, $5 waste disposal fee (required), $190 for Spay w/o meds and E Collar. 
***Banfield also tries to get you to to purchase this Wellness Program that they have and unless you have a pet with special medical needs, then it's NOT worth it. All they to do is try to find things to make more money off of you... I get it, it's a business, a lousy one at that.

~Siena Animal Hospital: $54.99 for an exam (required for any procedure), $10-$12 per shot, $55 Microchip & first year of reg. $33.35 waste/combo disposal fee (required), $250 for Spay and price doesn't include meds or E Collar.

~SNCSN: doesn't charge for an exam but they do one anyway, majority of shots are $12 each, $30 Microchip & first year of registration, NO waste disposal fee required, $105 for Spay- includes meds and E Collar ($90 w/o meds and E Collar)

We pay a fraction of the price of what they charge every where else in town. PetSmart prices are the average prices in Las Vegas and they're retardedly high. Sure they have those monthly plans that act like insurance but SNCSN still blows those prices out of the water! 

Anyway, on our last visit, before today, Dr. Brazil came in to the exam room with the syringes that were to be administered. Our Pup is a lil ball of energy and so Dr. Brazil took her into the other room to where someone would assist her. It's even like that with children, when my son was circumcised, they prefer that you do not stay in the room because some parents have bad reactions to the procedure. Although I don't agree with it all that much, it is what it is. I'd like to have things done properly rather than the person being so nervous as they perform  the procedure because of the parents breathing down the person's neck. 

We also had our pup's teeth extracted today and it went well. Since we had our pup spayed there, we were given a price, again, a fraction of the price compared to the other places that were charging $300 to pull 3 teeth. SNCSN even included the pain meds in the price. 

We'll be back, repeatedly for our lil pup's needs, even when she's not a pup anymore and definitely recommend this place to anyone with a four-legged family member.",5

to check on him and to let us know to call if we had any problems. A few weeks later we took him to get the rest of his shots and we were in and out in 20 minutes.

I brought my puppy in around 7am on a Saturday and she was ready for pick up by noon. They took good care of her and were very friendly through the whole process. They gave us clear and concise recovery directions and checked up on our little Zoe after the fact.

Zoe was perky and resilient after her surgery and was as good as new the next morning.",5
1059810,PVwveIhOvUtCKOSNCQc7pw,dVvSrn95G_jXlICKQpNFYA,"I'm still aghast at my experience at this clinic. From their web page, I know that there are at least 3 doctors who work here. Other reviewers had great experiences, and I'm wondering if they dealt with a different doctor. 

My husband and I and another couple brought our Bengal kittens (3 total) here to be spayed. The breeder also came with us. As soon as we walked into the clinic the front desk staff was very rude to us. Ok, maybe the were having a bad morning? That's easy enough to forgive.

But when we all went to the exam room, the doctor who examined our cats started us on a path of unnecessary emotional turmoil. Before we even saw her, we heard her say, ""Oh, Bengals? Great."" in a very sarcastic voice. Then when she saw the breeder she said, ""Oh,* you're* the breeder?"" and once again her tone was very nasty. To make matters worse, her clothes were rumpled and dirty and her hair was unkempt. I've seen lots of exhuasted vets, but lack of sleep could not account for her disturbing appearance.

This clinic examines the animals before they admitted for surgery, which is obviously a standard procedure anywhere you go. However, they took the cats out of the room to examine them. Since they were only going to be taking their temperature, weighing them, and listening to heart/lungs, I was alarmed that they took them out of the room. This always sets of warning bells. But since they weren't getting vaccines, I decided I was ok with it.

Within minutes, the doctor came back with one of the cats (not ours) and said, ""I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but this cat has a heart murmur."" What? Are you sure? Shortly thereafter, she brought out my cats and she diagnosed them with heart murmurs as well. We asked her to check them again later to give the cats time to calm down.  Once again, she said she heard heart murmurs with the comment, ""Well, they are Bengals.""

She said we should get a second opinion before ""sending the cats back"" (!!!), but she didn't give us any information about a specialist we could visit.  She then said she could go ahead with the surgery but it was likely that the cats wouldn't wake up because of their heart murmurs. But whatever our decision, she said, we'd better let her know soon because she had a backlog of animals to see. Well, gee, lady, excuse me while we cry and pet our cats.

Needless to say, we left. I was a wreck, and very upset about the fate of my kittens. I felt sick and afraid. However, I'm happy to report that neither of the cats (checked by different vets in different clinics) have heart murmurs. 

I know that the cat population is out of control and that for every purebred cat that is bought, there are thousands of homeless cats. I'm an animal lover and advocate, have rescued many cats, and I understand why a vet might be opposed to dealing with a Bengal, a Bengal owner, and a Bengal breeder. I sincerely hope that this wasn't the case at the Spay and Neuter Center and that the vet honestly thought the cats had murmurs. But that same day, I heard from another Bengal owner who had a similar experience at this clinic. 

In closing, I know that cost is a big issue. However, the spays at the Southern Nevada Spay & Neuter Center cost $80. Two other clinics near my house both charge $100 per spay. Spay & Neuter center charges $12 for vaccines. The ones by my house charge $10, or they are free for new patients. Spay & Neuter Center - $35 for microchip. By my house - $30/microchip.",1

I took my dog to this clinic and I was asked to take my other dog out of the waiting room while we were taking our second dog for his neuter. This was okay since my dog was acting out. But when I returned to get my dog I was told he wasn't ready and I asked politely if I could use the restroom and was denied that right and told to go to another business up the street. That they had two bathrooms and had some rescues in one bathroom and the private other bathroom I wouldn't be allowed to use. I find this very rude since I paid them in advance and denied bathroom access? How accommodating is this. I right there flat out told the receptionist she was rude. And she was really RUDE. I met the doctor and she was the only one nice. But the receptionist was a horror story in itself! I noticed when we first arrived. No nice greeting. Welcome Nothing! And felt like a number. No customer service and asked to take my dog out by this guard there. And just not a very pleasant first impression with the front reception desk. Like we are doing you a favor and we could care less to be nice to you attitude. I've ran a limousine service for over 20 years and I would not allow my front desk to give people a snotty impression. Especially at my front desk. I would never return. I was going to do all shots and when I got this nasty attitude. I only did the rabies and neuter. Figured I would do the rest of the shots somewhere that treats their customers with RESPECT and gratitude then deny you a bathroom as if your a robber or something. I gave the receptionist a piece of free ADVICE. No CHARGE. Your RUDE!
She immediately went back to get my dog to get me out of there. She's lucky she did that. Oh and my dog got a free blanket which they didn't do for anyone else. I guess my little girl asked them for it. And we got special attention above the rest. I give them one star not to bash put maybe they should consider a more pleasant reception girl at the front desk who is courteous and polite. The person at the front desk is the first impression of a business. And if she was overly nasty with a bad attitude. I wouldn't of wrote all this. Mind you we had a great day spending at the casinos with our dog who wasn't asked to leave before going to this place to pick up our dog. So we were not in a negative mode or state till she started with the nasty attitude.

I assured her I would be back and made the appt.

3 weeks later I came in for the appt.  I dropped him off at 7am.  There was a short wait but not bad.  I mentioned we had got him from craigslist and the woman/Dr checking him made a face.  From her body language it felt like she looked down on it or didn't like people getting dogs from craigslist.  It bothered me but I ignored it.  She suggested getting sedation medication so I took my file back to the front to pay for it.  I noticed she had written ""craigslist dog"" on his file.  We got him from a family who was going to take him to a shelter, not a backyard breeder.  I would think a lot of their business comes from animals from craigslist.  Rescues and shelters neuter their animals and vaccinate them before they are adopted.  After reading some reviews on yelp about how people say they were treated I can definitely see it.  

They call when you pet is out of surgery, let you know how your pet is doing and give you a pick up time.  I picked him up at 3pm and they give me a questionnaire on their service.  I expressed my concerns about the craigslist dog comment.  A vet tech talked to me and explained that they put that because I don't know his history or temperament.  I can kind of see that.  However they never once asked me how long we have had him, how old he was when we got him, do we know his history, etc.  That also doesn't explain the facial expressions and body language.  I do appreciate them caring that it bothered me and taking the time to talk to me about.  

There are a few extra charges that I wasn't expecting.  $10 for the cone so your pet doesn't lick themselves, $7 for sedation meds.  Both of these I were told were needed for so my dog doesn't have complications (scrotal swelling) after surgery.  I didn't mind but do think there might be people who only have the money for the procedure and don't have the extra $.  Then what?  I mean the cone especially seems pretty important.   I think it would be better if they just raised their rates a little so everything is included. 

Overall I would recommend them.  They are quick and efficient.  I think they are so busy that you don't get personal service but they are a spay/neuter and vaccination clinic not a full service vet so it is understandable.  I think they are doing a great service for Vegas and glad they are here.",4

We dropped of the babies and came back when WE called to check on them...I start to have warning bells going off in my head...first the doctor was a female who looked like she hadn't slept in a week (obviously grooming was NOT her strong suit)...I too started to notice snotty comments made about other customers, almost to the point I became uneasy about leaving them at the clinic. But my wife convinced me to leave them...she didn't realize the mistake we both had made...

When we got there, something seemed to be distracting going on behind the scene...little did I know it was our little six month old kitten, Rascal. First we seem to be set aside for what seemed like quite a while...these people brought me Rascal's carrier surrounded with duct tape to hold the door on (when we took it in, it WAS a new carrier, are you kidding me?)...we were told Bandit, his brother was just fine...however they had a problem with Rascal...supposedly Rascal bit someone there in the face, When I asked them if I could see and talk to the employee, I was told they had left. (@2pm?)...well...needless to say I KNOW these people mistreated this animal severely...to this day seven months later, Rascal is a very skiddish cat...(the funny thing is...this was the MOST gentle and loving cat before he went to these butchers...)...the idiots told me...""the cat tried to jump back into the box and broke the door""...reallyI

I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS CLINIC...the safety of your furbabies is not worth the few dollars you save...I will never use this clinic again...and I advise YOU don't either...They as a company do not respect you as a customer...they do not deserve your business...attitudes, lies and snotty comments are really no way to run a clinic. In the end...YOUR pet will be the loser...wish I had read yelp! at the time

I know I only asked for shots but they didn't even do the usual stuff like check weight, height, etc. His rabies certificate didn't have any assessment at all and we didn't even see a vet, God knows who gave the shot...or if they even really gave it (I hope they really did). Service feels rushed like we're in a fast food chain. Didn't feel any care at all, thus, the one star. If it's just spay or neuter or shots you need go to the shelter instead where there's that consolation of a cheaper price.",1

I figured that I would take my pup in to the same place to be fixed, since I had such a great experience last time. 

My problem started almost immediately when I walked in. You see, first off, i has just driven all the way across town (from mts edge) with a dog who has motion sickness and was scared and drooling all over me the entire 35 minute drive. Then when I was in, I am not even acknowledged for a good 5 min. When it's finally my turn to get up to the counter, I am asked to fill out a paper and shooed away. I return said paper, and this is when my issues began. The young girl who was helping me(wearing a Pima medical scrub outfit) was extremely rude from the second she started helping me. She was curt and bossy. And when she led me into the exam room, I didn't like the way she handled the other dog in the room. It was almost as though she was angry with the animals and was taking her aggression out on them. This vision of how she treated a beautiful golden retriever was engraved in my brain all day. At first I thought I was over reacting until I walked back in to pick up my dog. But first let me back track to the ""pick up call"" I got a text message telling me my pup was ready and doin fine but to call to confirm that I got the message. I did just that, and when I said I would be in at 330 to pick him up, she tried to tell me that it was going to be too busy at that time. Well guess what? Too effing bad! I have a job, and I can't just come and go as I please. 

Now back to when I walked in to pick up my dog.... The same rude & aggressive chick that helped me earlier was the one who went to get him for me. When he came out he was shaking and very happy to see me. I was bending down petting him when he started to lick his wounds. She literally grabbed my dogs head and smacked it to the side. I was so pissed I looked at her and told her not to do that again. I don't know who the hell she thinks she is, but I treat NO animal in that manner. Especially not a stranger's pet. Anywho, she disappeared with him and then came back and I got the heck outta there as fast as possible. I will never go back. I'd rather pay $432,564,997  for a staff that has compassion over the $50 I saved",2
1059818,sHdy9wXxeGrLjfPSwpd9nw,dVvSrn95G_jXlICKQpNFYA,"I took my female corgi here for a spay a few years ago and they did a terrible job. The incision was not clean and there was an unnecessary amount of redness and swelling. The stitches also did not dissolve and I had to bring her somewhere else to be removed.

 Against my own instincts, I brought my male corgi here to be neutered just yesterday. My friend (who has been a vet tech for 10 years) convinced me that a neuter is a very simple operation and hard to mess up so I brought him here to save me about $200.

 As I picked him up out of the car after bringing him home, I noticed blood on my car seat. I checked the incision and it was still bleeding and seeping. The incision was not fully closed nor was it smooth.  I brought him back to close the incision and now he's left with an ugly clump of skin mass where his testicles had been. 

They told me he had been biting at the incision, which he had not. He couldn't even keep his eyes open, let alone bite himself.  On top of that I had my eyes and hands on him the entire time. The vet tech expressed, in a round about way, that I was lying.

 I'd rather have paid the extra $200 if I knew this is what was going to happen. If you care about your pets, DO NOT spay or neuter here.",1

We took our 3 baby Dachshunds here May 4th 2013 to be spayed. The care they received was 4 star!!!! When we went to pick the Babies up they explained everything and had pain meds for them and a new Blanket for each of them.Then they brought the babies out and asked if we had any further questions or concerns.

My cat was very sleepy for about 2 days after the surgery from the pain medicine shot they give, which was good.

You can also add on services like nail clipping and anal gland squeezing.  Vaccines are only $12.  

Make an appointment and then bring your dog in sometime between 7am and 8am the day of.  They can either call you or text you when your dog will be done.  The staff is really friendly, informative and helpful.  If it weren't for this location being on the other side of LV for me, I would make this my go to veterinarian.

We took in a 1 year old male Shih Tzu who wasn't fixed and from day one it was INSANE having him at our house with our other 2 year old male. He was a total hump machine and by day 2 I was trying to call The Animal Foundation to bring in our new guy for neutering ASAP. The Animal Foundation would never pick up their phone (I tried numerous times) so I couldn't make an appointment. I found the Spay & Neuter center after some research and they were able to make an appt for the very next day thankfully! I arrived by 7:15 (was told to be there anytime from 7am to 8am for check in) and there were only 3 other groups of people there. Everyone from the phone appointment person, the receptionist, the assistants and even the guests in the waiting room were all friendly and it was a calm experience. I was only in the waiting room for the vet very briefly before she came in with her assistant and did a general exam and explained the process. The vet was very professional, well put together and very kind. I definitely felt at ease with her. I was out of the clinic by 8:00am. They sent a text that our boy was doing well at about 10:30am and said I could come for pick up after 12:30pm. Picked him up and he was totally fine and awake. Never cried from any pain. His stitches looked good and he's healed really well (it's 6 days in as I write this and he's totally great and his wounds are all brown and healing and he has no inclination to lick at them). I can't complain about a single step in this process. I'm thankful they could take us in as quickly as they did and everything was easy peasy. Here's hoping the hump monster has been curbed :)",5

As far as this MUCH more reasonable spay and neuter center goes, I have been nothing but pleased, so far. The receptionists were informative, up front on costs, and pleasant the 3 or 4 times I talked with them to find out the schedule, make an appointment and confirm the same.

The check in was busy but not at all chaotic. There are separate sides for cats and dogs to sit, which is a relief for cat owners. I took Harry to the screening room and Dr. Griffith was the first one to see Harry just moments later. She was very compassionate and took the time to allay my fears about anesthesia and the procedure. I am expecting all will go well from here and will get a text follow up to let me know when Harry is out of surgery and on what time I can bring Harry home. I am sure he will love being a conehead for the next 8-10 days ---- NOT. Oh well, otherwise he will be licking and gnawing where he shouldn't!

Also don't worry if you bring your cat here. They do have a separate waiting room to ease your mind.

You fill out paperwork and you can opt for a microchip ($35) and cone ($10) at the same time which we did to get it all done. There's also an option for sedative pills ($10) in case your dog gets hyper later because he or she shouldn't run post-surgery and we added that too. $95 for spaying and with all the add-ons it came out to a reasonable $150 for me.

1076546,fmOxvliS0gokT0uXrbdvrA,6MWPjqhSonAwE5A2uIcEPg,"Reviewing a hospital seems kind of odd, but there is a category for it so I will go for it,

The Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh moved to this new location in 2003 and is quite a modern hospital. I have been here on two occasions. Once my flatmate had suspected meningitis and was rushed to the Urgent Care department where she was treated very well.

The second occasion was a few Friday nights ago. Poor me was all ill and feeling sorry for myself and NHS 24 sent me here at 2 am. My lovely boyfriend got up and drove me here with the help of google maps. MISTAKE. This A&E department on a Friday night somewhat resembles a Jeremy Kyle audition. Out of 20 people in the waiting room (some who were there with their mates because that's the cool thing to do), I was the only sober person who was actually ill. Everyone else was drunk or had been drinking and were there as a result of a fight or a drunken accident. It was quite appalling and the people in here were real bottom feeders. Eye contact: not recommended. 

I waited here 3 hours. Yes 3 hours because Davey and John Paul punched each others lights out, or Chantelle was so drunk she fell on some glass. There was more police here than doctors, that gives an indication of the type of people and behaviour that go on in this A & E department. It is very sad and gives a true indication of this country. Where is the policy in this Gordon and David? 

When I eventually saw the doctor he was great. Filled me with drugs and was very helpful. I actually felt sorry for the guy having to deal with this every Friday/Saturday night. He apologised to me for having to wait so long and said it was due to all the drunken fools in the waiting area (not in those words of course). My boyfriend commented on how awful it was and the doctor threw his hands up and said ''this is my life!'' Kudos to him because I doubt I could be motivated to come to work and deal with that every night. 

Obviously if you are ill and need hospital attention you aren't going to check up on Yelp for reviews on the local hospitals. Just be mindful of the fact that on a Friday/Saturday night between 12 am and 4 am you will have to wait for all the drunken chavs in Edinburgh to be bandaged up.",3
1076547,xuSnW3RwVE3lF-BhqfabTw,6MWPjqhSonAwE5A2uIcEPg,"I still laugh every time I remember my visit here. The first time my then boyfriend was cooking dinner for me, he managed to cut the end of his finger off whilst trying to impress me with how fast he could chop stuff, the way chefs do it on TV. Only he's not a professional chef. 

Anyway, we got here at about 10pm, and I can safely say it was the most mind-numbingly boring 3 and a half hours of my entire life. There weren't even enough seats for people to wait on, there was no screen with the queueing system on it like in any other hospitals I've been in, and there wasn't even anything in the vending machine apart from a Bounty - the pigeon of the chocolate bar world, and even that cost me 70p.

Grumble over, when we were eventually seen the doctor was great. In fact, we were on our way out less than 20 minutes later with plenty of instructions for the after-care and how to replace the dressings etc. Although it was nice of him to tell us not to hesitate to come back if it got infected or anything, I can safely say if that had been the case then I would not have been doing the dutiful girlfriend thing and tagging along again.

I visited the Sanctuary in the Royal Infirmary a few times while I was there, a relaxing, calming space you could go to, to get off the ward and escape for a while, although it was nice to get out of the ward and there was usually no one there so you could be alone, it was pretty chilly in there!

When I arrived at 2 in the afternoon, his blood pressure was 177/87, and he had not been offered anything to eat. I told the staff that he needed his afternoon blood pressure meds.  They said I had to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came and examined him and ordered a nitroglycerine patch and left.  An hour later, he had still not received blood pressure medication and his blood pressure was still alarmingly elevated.  I talked to the nurse who told me that the doctor hadn't ordered any medication as he was afraid that with the nitro it would lower his blood pressure too low.  I had to leave at 4 p.m. for a doctor's appointment.  My husband called me at 6:45 p.m. to say that he had been given a room.  His blood pressure was still sky high; he had still not been offered food or blood pressure lowering meds.  I talked to him several more times trying to calm him down.  At 9:30 p.m. he still hadn't received medication or food.   The next morning when I went to visit, they had him on a sodium chloride drip.  I don't understand why they would be giving sodium when his blood pressure often shoots up to over 200.  He could have been given water to drink if he was dehydrated.    We will never go to this hospital again",1

Nonetheless, I arrived and was seen by the triage nurse promptly and was in a room and seeing a doctor within 15 minutes of arrival.  Now granted I was having chest pains which probably explains why I was seen promptly.  However, my wife had to visit the ER at Boswell twice this year and she was seen and in a room promptly as well and she didn't have chest pains.

My stay at Boswell was very pleasant and I felt confident that the doctors and the entire staff were doing everything possible such  tests and labs accordingly to determine the cause of my chest pains.  I felt safe and comfortable the entire time.

The CNA's, Nurses & Doctors and everyone involved in my care were awesome !

I would like to personally thank should they ever see this post RN Mary, Britney and Bethany and the CNA's under your supervision at the time and Dr. Fala and the other doctors for being so nice, friendly and professional.

He never put in an order for B/P after another small wait I was called to the little room area for Weight & Temp as well as B/P. My blood pressure was still high. Again no medication for the B. pressure and I advised her that I am not staying over, Nurse said she would get me a form to sign when I got into the room.We went back out to waiting again.They came and got me.First thing this nurse says is we will get  you upstairs soon,Again I had to advise her That is Not Happening. You would think someone would write it down as 3 more Nurses had to be told that same thing. I am not staying , From 1 or so to 4,20 They gave me nothing for B/P .they did give me a med for some nausea I asked for a sandwich at 2.40 pm I am diabetic and needed 2 eat, at 3.10 Nothing had come yet, My Mom and Fiancee went and got me what I asked for which was just a sandwich and nothing more, , At 4 or so the nurse asked if it arrived.It had not and never did, She said all they had was peanut butter and jelly, dialysis patients are not allowed any p. butter "" ever "" at 415 or so Dr came in and said you need dialysis now I,told him no,All hospitals under banner have mandatory 3 day stay when they do dialysis, He never said a word, about that .One more stall and Told him enough is enough, Take out IV or i am walking, All of a sudden  They are doing e.k g, They had not done anything but a blood test after four hours had gone by and still no B/P pills,No sandwich had arrived. It was close to insulin time,( Mind u my previous stay in Nov They did not to give me my insulin until 8.30 pm and that was not complete..I Did not get my next  dose till a half hour later, I was 329 at 1.30 am I did not get insulin until 2 hours later after that..When I questioned  why they said it,s protocol as we must ask doctor first. I replied are you kidding No doctor is needed when any diabetic is that high, You could have killed me as my organs could have shut down , I replied get the insulin or I call my atty, My Mom showed back up because I had called her at 2;20 am and she brought my insulin), Back to ER and the lying staff .. I said You could not even get me a sandwich there is no way u are sticking me. The doctor asked at least 2 more times for me to stay there,I replied that is not happening,I asked again for the 3rd time where is letter that I have been asking for and that the lady who checked me in said they would get to me. The Doctor had no response and then I,told him that is why I do not trust you or this garbage dump. Then out of the blue a nurse came in with a EK G machine. One more stall tactic. Why wasnt this done in the begining like all the other  patience had done in the waiting room. In the end I never got my Sandwich,Medicines or anything but grief from the absolute lying and extremely slow and incompetent staff. I never got my letter that I was asking for and it was promised to get to me by the first nurse in the small room. I will never return, to this pig pen of sh** place I will never go there again, I am going to put in complaints where ever I can.

Your wait time in the ER will be at least 2 hours and then another hour waiting for someone to come see you. If they start you on antibiotics, you can expect another 60 minute wait for your medicine. We had a recent incident that I can't go in to for privacy reasons but all I can say is potential lawsuit. Every time I have come to this hospital there is a hassle, staff always takes the path of least resistance, and are sometimes just downright unhelpful. 

I have also heard horror stories from other people about Del Webb. I'm normally not a complainer and usually have great experiences wherever I go, but it has been one thing after another with this place.

I was able to hear everyone complaining to the head nurse that the patients need to be ready, and they have nothing to do until patients are all ready! Now besides that, my time there was very pleasant. My pre-op was also done very quickly three days prior to surgery. Overall you don't want to be at a hospital unless you are having a child!

When you tell them why you have come to the emergency room, they act almost as if you are lying. They'll put you in a room to sit in a chair while waiting for your results and not check on you to see if there is anything that you need and then when you need medicine you have to track down a nurse and ask them, only for them to tell you they have to speak to someone else first. Well then you wait another hour and have to go track down another nurse who then tells you that your original nurse (douche bag Chris) has taken a lunch and will be back later. So then you go through multiple nurses who give you attitude and act like you are the biggest inconvenience to them until you finally get someone who comes into help, but acts like a huge fucking prick. How do you neglect that there is multiple patients sitting all in this one room who need immediate attention and have been asking for help for hours? I finally flipped out and went off on every nurse who came in. What happened to being caring and compassionate towards your patients? Isn't that a part of being a nurse? I understand that you have long days and a lot on your plate, but it's no excuse to treat your patients poorly. I no longer will visit this hospital. Not even if I'm on my death bed. Don't get me wrong, there are less than a handful of nurses who are kind and actually care. I wish I had remembered their names, but they are wonderful. They didn't make me feel as if they needed to get me out as quickly as they can. They made me feel genuinely cared for. Thank you to you lovelies.",1

In all the time we have been here we have seen the nurse once because he was passing through and spoke with the so called Dr. once only to answer questions.  He did not explain anything!  Of course the bill collector was right there asking for their share as if that was the first thing on our mind.  Please!

Typically an ER will force rank who should be seen based on the severity of a situation and an allergic reaction ALWAYS ranks with heart and stroke issues.  It's life threatening and has to be dealt with immediately.

Thank goodness it was not but it took the very rude employees who lack any sign of compassion over 5-hours to get him into a room.  He never saw a doctor and they mis-diagnosed him.  (We took him to see a doctor the next day).  Ended up being there 8-hours.  Every employee except 2 were very rude and showed no sense of urgency to take care of the patients.

A few days later a nurse called to follow up--I gave her the full report of what happened.  When I told her that he never saw a doctor her response was, ""well, were you ever told you would see one?""  I was in complete shock, isn't that the point of an emergency room???? 

People could have died in the corner and the majority of the employees could have cared less.  Absolute worst hospital we have ever experienced, anywhere in the world! If I could give the hospital.

1129059,HiQqT9OG0jrGGakU82a5QA,h5AWTkbYzRk-k5LS6rQtHQ,"My review is STRICTLY for the doctor who saw us in the ER.
Dr. Abeer Duggal Pa was one of the most open doctors my boyfriend and I have encountered. 
We have recently moved into the area from out of state and are still trying to find primary physicians. When my boyfriend started getting burning headaches we were very concerned and wanted someone to see him right away, but most doctors in the area have a 6-8 week waiting period for new patients. This is what brought us to the ER today. We wanted to see if we could get some answers sooner. 
We believe strongly in allowing the body to heal naturally as often as possible. If you give your body the right vitamins and the proper care you are much less likely to require western medical procedures. 
Dr. Abeer Duggal Pa understood our views and did not belittle or laugh at us like the bald male RN who took my boyfriend's temperature did. 
My boyfriend and I are not hippies who are out to bring down the pharmaceutical industry or anything crazy. We just do everything we can to avoid things that are toxic to the body, like CAT scans, preservatives, and hidden unnecessary ingredients in medications and foods. Dr. Duggal Pa understood this with us and did not try to sway us and explained things that he thought we may find beneficial. I really appreciated that with this doctor and wish there were more understanding and open doctors like him.",5

I had the pleasure of delivering my first baby at this hospital on 11/09/14. I stayed 2 days. My delivery nurse Melissa was incredible. And Leilani was the most professional, understanding nurse I've ever had the pleasure of meeting. But during my stay a nurse or ""tech"" named Emilia was rude and even judgmental. She went as far as telling me to get out of bed, stop whining and that I'm not going to have someone with me ""24/7"" to hear my complaints when I get home. This was less than 48 hours after giving birth for the first time. Sorry I was in pain. Emilia shouldn't be allowed to deal with patients that are in pain and battling baby blues and possible PPD. Also, I was there for 2 days and the nurses switched shifts about every 12 hours but my linens and trash were both changed only once. I actually started disinfecting my own room. That's a shame.

Next day she felt worst so we took her elsewhere. And come to find out she had a bad uti..yet she was treated for strep.????? After taking urine samples, you wouldve figure they would find something.. Dr didn't seem too confident as she walked away . So I was left uneasy .

If you have to go to an urgent care for your children in the middle of the night I cannot say enough good things about these people.  They are pretty quick, MUCH faster than an ER would be, and they have always been helpful.  The woman doctor there, I have never gotten her name, is VERY nice!

This is unique children's urgent care.  They open at 5:00PM and close at 5:00AM.  We are too fond of our current pediatrician.  when we take our kids to the pediatrician we have to make an appointment or go during the ""sick time"" hours.  Which basically means we have to wait several hours when all the patients with appointments are done.  

My wife was hesitant at first when we took our baby but then found out how great the doctors are.  It is easy if you get out of work at 5.  You can go right after and not have to take time off of work.  I recommend this place because the hours of accommodating and the doctors are great!",5

With each test that was administered, the doctor spoke to my son and let him know everything was going to be okay, and he was going to feel much better after all those ""mean"" germs were gone.

I actually was considering making her my son's primary care physician. She thoroughly checked him and we were happy to know if was needless worry and all is well!!
The only downside is that they charge $40 copay irrespective but that's understandable since its an all night clinic. We were told that they have a lab with X-rays on site in case needed. Removing one star only causes we had to wait after intake got 1.5 hours...

There were no one in the waiting room so we were thinking this is is going to be fast. In the room, they had G.I. Joe on tv that was really loud. Firstly my son was cranky and cried due to the new surroundings. We had to ask the guy who was in the front office to turn the volume down a little. He was not happy with the request but did it anyway. He was also typing really hard on his keyboard. I do not know whether that is intentional. So after all the paperwork, we waited for the doc. I didn't mind the $40 Co-pay here. I was upset about the Customer Service rendered to us by them. After an hour plus waiting, no one checked on us or even apologized for the wait. We had to ask someone when we will get baby checked. Finally at 12mn, we saw the Dr. My baby was not diagnosed with any infection. Per Doc, probably virus. They gave my baby Motrin and another stuff for his tummy.  My baby's fine now. No other signs of virus or infections. I am glad abt that.

The doctor and the nurses were amazing I wish i remembered their names, checked on us when we were waiting to make sure the antibiotics wasn't going to give my baby an allergic reaction, we had to go three days in a row. Cost a good amount even after insurance paid and having to go three days in a row.  So next time we will just bring her to SW Medical Associates.

When the nurse tried to draw blood from my baby she tried so many times to find a vein and couldn't get enough blood. I did NOT like the fact that they kept trying and even after seeing me break down crying because my baby was screaming bloody murder they kept on going.

I left worried sick, having to wait until Monday morning to see our regular pedi. On Monday our pediatrician was horrified that nothing was done. My son needed an aggressive antibiotic treatment that should have been started that day, even prophyllactically as his condition ended up being time sensitive.

He proceeded to write down mathematics formulas on a piece of paper while saying it out loud sarcastically of why he's correct and the other info is wrong. 
Then after he left without explaining anything to me about my child's illness..  I asked the nurse if I can ask him a couple more questions. He comes back in with an annoyed look on his face and told me to hurry because he has eleven patients and he doesn't have time.  Wow assh***.

I should of reviewed the most recent yelp postings but my pediatrician raves about going to this facility over the 24 hour urgent care at Southwest.  Well I followed my doctors directions and was completely shocked at how condescending a pediatric medical professional team member could be in a facility that specializes for children.  I arrived at their facility at 4:35 am and honestly was not expected to be seen because I know they close at 5:00 am.  The medical assistant mentioned their closing but indicated they would still accept us.  She was very nice and patient with us and understood that we traveled far from the NW in the middle of the night to this facility recommend by our doctor.  During the triage assessment she said that the dosage for the Motrin I was giving him was not correct from the packaging, which could be a reason why his fever keeps spiking up.  I said okay, the last time he was sick was last year so I might have been given some information about that but just purchased a new package of meds and followed the directions.  Then when we went into the room, she said to me, she had told me she needed to wake the doctor and he would be right in.  Well the first thing this physician said was you only have 8 mins until I leave.  Then proceed to ask me a literally 20 questions that were all no until he said why are you here. When I went to state my son had been running a fever, he immediate took out a sheet and said in a condensing voice your giving him the wrong dosage he should have 3x more of what the package says.  I replied back okay that is fine and dandy well increase the dosage however is this viral or bacteria, then right when I said this to him he said take his shirt off I will be back (ignoring my question and not stating what will be next).  Then the doctor came back (now he was gone for 5 mins) and proceed to assess my son, by checking his breathing, lungs, ears, and throat.  He said he needed to do a culture for his throat and called his assistant to come into the room to do it.  When he opened the door to call her again he stood at the door and said in a disgusted manner that it takes 8 mins for the results and walked away.  After 8 mins was up he said it came back negative and I said then it must be viral at that time he basically gave me the most evillest look ever.  Then proceed to lecture me about time and how the medical assistance ""bosses"" won't like the fact that she has 15 mins of overtime, that I should of came earlier, and that he has been ""on"" for the past 48 hours (this is the condensed version of him going on for 5 mins about us arriving their before closing).  I told him, there won't be a next time, smiled and was walking away and then he proceed to talk about how he gives the dosage of medicine to his own son and that it is more helpful then what is on the package.  I know some doctors an be very patronizing to patients but never experienced this in a pediatrician environment (granted I have had the same pediatrician for 15 years with my children) and then to have the doctor turn around and attempt to have a conversation as your walking away is so irrational.  First, you want us to leave and then when its not pertaining to treatment you expect a conversation. Nerveless, be cautious when using this facility as it is exaggerated in how it caters to families.  I would of much preferred to be turned away with a policy of the last patient must be checked in by 4:30 am then to be treated as being inferior.

At the request to list all aspects of condescending actions during this visit here they are in addition to the above:
*doctor snapping fingers at me while he is talking to invoke a quicker response
*doctor not allowing me to speak until he asks a question
*doctor stating to me that he has been up for 48 hours which is not true since the assisted said she needed to wake him up
*doctor stating to me not to come that late to their facility next time
*doctor demonstrating an annoyed disposition during visit",1

My daughters live in Vegas, I live in NYC.  They were graduating from jhs and my hubby and I flew in to attend the graduation, and to stay for an additional week for a family vacation.  Things turned for the worse when my daughter's cough refused to go away and she developed a fever.  I was worried and panicky, so I searched for a clinic on Google and found this place. We drove from Boulder Hwy to Green Valley in a haste, glad that it was only a few minutes away.

The parking is good, the place was very clean and the decor was nice for a peds place.  We got in at 1am; only one other parent was in the waiting room.  We waited for five minutes and then the nurse called us in for triage.  She was really kind. She gave her Motrin for the fever and told us to wait in the next room for the doctor.  Remember: there was only one other parent in the waiting room.

Thirty minutes later, the doc comes in--dude with the glasses--and proceeded to crack corny ass jokes about my child's health and condition.  Mutha*&^%!! I'm in no mood at 2am with a sickly child!  He touched her throat, looked in her ears and nose and told me it was a viral infection.  Wrote a prescription for cough syrup and sent us on our way. No xray, nada.

GUESS WHAT? My daughter got worse---I had to take her to ANOTHER URGENT CARE LOCATION--the one on Craig Rd and Clayton in North Las Vegas.  The Physician's Assistant there--his name is Tony---gave her a chest xray.  SHE HAD PNEUMONIA---IN BOTH LUNGS! Tony pulled up the images and showed me my daughter's lungs.  He explained everything and prescribed antibiotics.  I was so relieved that I took a chance on THAT urgent care because THIS one was totally a WASTE of time and money.  Did I mentioned that GNP charged $40 for the visit?

You could also hear Dr. K's side conversations about halloween, hanukah, xmas when people had been waiting so long!! Sorry doc we want you to speed up the process not make small talk. There was absolutely no sense of urgency, no apologies and a poor sense of humor. We will never be back and do not recommend this facility.

They did vitals and I spoke with a nurse, assistant, and ER doctor in about 15 minutes.  A few minutes later they had me in Xray and another 20 the doc gave me the news.  Everyone was nice and depending on the insurance carrier is how much you pay.  I had to pony up $150 for Blue Cross but I am sure the damage is much worse than that.  Before I left they shot me up with Demerol, gave me a script for percocet, and sent me away with a disc of my Xray's....so I don't have to keep paying for those.

My beef is with the office practices.

You know what they say about a bad experience... and let me introduce myself as a squeaky wheel. 

I am posting this review so that others can be aware and protect themselves so they do not have to find themselves in the same predicament that I did.

When I woke up and couldn't walk on October 2nd of last year .. I found that my life was dramatically altered.  I had gone to the emergency room and told that I had a sprain... (how do you do that sleeping?? ) (don't worry St Rose will get a yelp too!!) So by Wednesday when bedrest and percocet did not help me to be able to walk again... I called my friend who's husband is a doctor to see who she would suggest as a foot specialist ... she and I both went on my insurance's website CIGNA.  Where we found that this doctor's office was a preferred provider ...  BONUS!

They could get me in that day! DOUBLE BONUS!

When I  got to the office , they took my insurance information, Had me fill out forms and then I waited to see the doctor.
After my visit , when I checked out I was told ""You are all good we will see you in two weeks after your bedrest""
I figured this was because I had already met my out of pocket expense with the emergency room visit. 

Two weeks later- when still not walking surgery was scheduled . 
I again checked out asked abouta copay and was told .. nope have a good day!

Surgery scheduled and also post ops scheduled. 

I had my surgery. Then a week later I had my first post op visit.  
I checked out and again no copay -Suh-weeeet! I was loving my insurance! Meeting your out of pocket expense rocks! 

I had two other post op visits - when at the last one I was told.
""hmm you have a balance. you might want to start paying on this.""

Me: Balance ... why is that I met my out of pocket expense.

Office- Well we are not a preferred provider.

Me What are YOU talking about I found you listed under preferred providers from my insurance and everytime I have come in you haven't said one thing.
       you are telling me this AFTER I have surgery.
Office- well you can appeal it with Cigna -
My sister was silently fuming beside me - since she had to drive me to all of my doctors visits since i couldn't walk.
Don't you think you should have said something prior to her surgery? Like the first visit when she saw you?
Office - we aren't sure what happened with that.
Me - err ok well I wil definitely be appealing.

I went home and checked Cigna's website and conveniently ... the doctor and his office were conveniently no longer on the website.

Convenient!

I quickly called Cigna and got the appeal process and just as quickly wrote a letter requesting an appeal.
Months pass by .. I receive NO bill from the doctor and no denial of appeal from my insurance. 

When I get a knock at my door and am being told that I am being sued for 1200.00. For charges from Las Vegas Food and ankle.

Errr WTH?

I am at this point shaking I am so angry. 

I was told that in the state of nevada that you do not have to get a bill.. a bill is a courtesy .. and that it is the patients responsibility to see if they hyave a balance. 
are you kidding me with that?
NOPE!

I am paying the bill which Iwould have no problem paying if it had not been for the fact that I asked EVERY single time I went in if there was a copay ... or anyting I needed to do... I was told at every sing turn NO there is no bill you are all good.... Until that last doctors visit.
I feel that the office staff has a responsibility to let the patient know if they have changed their status with an insurance company because patients go in trusting that the office will not steer them wrong and that they are there to help the patient understand what coverages apply to their office.

I used to be a secretary for a OB/GYN practice and believe me I discussed insurance and whether a patient was covered or not covered EVERY single visit. 

I honestly have never felt so .... deceived. 

So do I recommend the doctors.. SURE .. but enter the office at your own risk you could come out paying.... more than you expect!",1
1276353,qmJcdi98GgObIBV7Nkq36A,2C4kPPlqnirayO6Dfv_-BQ,"I was directed to this office and specifically Dr. Reed by a raving recommendation by a friend that had a successful bunionectomy. I was looking forward to finding a new podiatrist and I had a wonderful experience! My visit was prompted by a toenail that had experienced extreme trauma and needed removal. From my consultation to the procedure (done in one visit), Dr. Reed was friendly, professional, and comforting - everything I look for in a doctor. It's been almost a year since the procedure and my nail has grown back normally and its as if nothing happened. And now I am back for another consultation and look forward to another great experience. I highly recommend Dr. Reed for all your foot and ankle needs! FYI, they take Aetna and United Healthcare.",5
1276354,K3FhtePiOZkx8lVnndESMw,2C4kPPlqnirayO6Dfv_-BQ,"Would give them zero stars if I could. Agree 110% with the other two reviewers who had bad experiences here. This office sent me to COLLECTIONS for a bill that I never received. I only found out that they had sent me to collections when I called to make an appointment months after my initial appointment. Never received a bill, never was contacted by the collections agency even. I now have a black mark on my credit report until the year 2019 for a bill I never received. 

To top it off, their office staff and management was EXTREMELY rude. I have NEVER in my life not paid a bill on time. I was harassed by their staff and treated like garbage. They insisted they had called me about the bill and had sent a paper bill, neither of which is true. It makes me livid just thinking about it. 

 I would hope the doctors wise up and get a clue about how their office staff is treating their patients, but clearly their main concern is making money. I can only hope that these clearly unethical business practices come to light sooner rather than later and no other innocent people are hurt financially by this office.",1
1276355,UBOywMkIIhiegMCj08VwwQ,2C4kPPlqnirayO6Dfv_-BQ,"So I was referred by my ins provider, and after reading the Yelp reviews I knew to ask the receptionist if my $50 copay covered EVERYTHING. She said yes it did.  Proceeded to receive an xray and injection and was told by Dr. Tilton that I had a small bone spur but wouldn't need further treatment.  Ever.  That was 2.5 months ago and I'm in pain again. My referral is still good so I call to make an appt. and I'm informed I have a $43 balance.  I could have gone to collections over this as they never informed me of anything and never sent me a bill.  I have an appt. with them tomorrow and will follow up here but so far 1 star is generous.",1

The doctor and nurses who attended to him were fabulous.  The doctor kept saying ""I'm sorry this happened to you,"" and he explained everything he did during the medical procedure.  They helped put us at ease during a very stressful and scary situation.  While I was in the waiting room, a former patient came in to thank the doctors for working on him a year prior.  They also seemed very happy.    If I am ever injured in Vegas, I will demand to be taken to this location.",5
1345028,rHtk6CGlZr1e5MeN8nxrNw,brRLTlAA3Y_KW4paeN7wYA,"Okay so the trauma unit was amazing seriously amazing 28 staples in my head, broken neck, four different broken vertebrae, broken left arm, left collapsed lung, detached right ear, A copious amount of glass in my left eye...they put me back together again and save my life they said I would never walk again and I was paralyzed the first four days and days later I was doing stairs...but then I got an infection due to neglect from there after care not in the trauma department but when I was released from trauma into a different unit I then had to stay the hospital for 84 days and had to have four additional operations on top of one operation not only was I stuck there for 84 days of my life but I got MRSA and all my organs started to shut down and my kidneys from the failure and shock and I had to get blood transfusions thank God I'm alive but the neglect was despicable and atrocious that I received when I was released from trauma again the trauma team was miracle workers but the lazy ass nurses I actually have video footage on my phone and audio put it on my phone of me begging them to change my soaking wet bloody bandages on my neck and then refusing to and I had sores all over my behind from having to sit and a bedpan filled with cold urine because they wouldn't remove it....",2

Shout outs too Peter & Oscar in the Trauma Department they were amazing. They were very attentive.We were their for about 2 hours at the most.

1353295,hNBwnlzhzQkcj4vyY4sEBg,zKB8YXy-l2ULvjA5V9FOpg,"Very nice new Hospital and the staff is actualy pretty nice, but .......

Even though there was not very much going on because I checked in my wife and she was quickly seen, but the staff seemed very unorganized, we got a visit from the Dr and he asked what was wrong and he checked her, told her what was wrong and what meds he would give her and he was on his way, but then another Medic came in, asked the same questions ""What's wrong?, what brings you here?"" and then he went on his way. Then another medic came in and same questions, then a nurse came in and same questions, and then another .... I kid not we had to explain to at least 8 people what was wrong, 3 nurses entered some info into the system and each time one of them came in they woud keep asking and asking, it's like there is no communication between them and it's like none of them had anything else to do so they would see ""Oh someone is in that room over there I better go and look and act like I am busy doing something"".

Again, it looked ike not many people were being tended to and they still held us for over 2 hours, I understand they had to keep my wife for some time just to make sure she wasn't coming back again but the Dr that visited us first told us it wasn't anything serious and he would give her some meds for it, but yet it took 2+ hours for it.

I am never, ever, ever, coming back, now I understand why it was so ""empty"" when we came in, I guess other people knew about what we went through.",1
1353296,rmIYZ0eoBpkwDqhYdPqEVA,zKB8YXy-l2ULvjA5V9FOpg,I took my dad to this hospital and the staff were really nice. We were in the ER due to him having some food stuck in his esophagus. We were here for 6 hours total. During the first 3 hours all they did was give him 2 shots of medicine to try to relax the muscle and a small can of ginger ale that seemed not to work so they then went in and took an X ray or Ct scan to see where the food was lodged at. They then said he would have to have surgery to have it removed. They then removed it. We just got the bill in and it was 35000.00 dollars for being there for 6 hours. This 35000.00 was separate from the anesthesiologist charge of 1800.00 dollars and the dr that did the surgery which charged only 300.00 dollars. My complaint here is how can they charge 35000.00 for an ER visit and a Ct scan and 2 shots and a can of ginger ale. Also my girlfriend was there recently and was charged 45000.00 for a day and a half spent in there which they never found out what was wrong and i ended up taken her to gilbert mercy hospital 2 days later where they found she had spinal meningitis. I will never ever go back to this hospital it just charges way to much,1
1353297,9RWNrpcifMfQchRfYPMwXg,zKB8YXy-l2ULvjA5V9FOpg,"I had a great experience at Florence Hospital. 

Pros: 
1. Quick door to doctor (I didn't even sit down and I was already talking to a doctor).
2. Very helpful staff
3. Portable X-Ray machine is very convenient 
4. Doctors are knowledgeable and presented the correct diagnosis

Cons:
1. They are out of network, and considered a private hospital. (Not an issue in the event of an emergency, but something to take into consideration)",4
1369471,JrQJVDgQQF94x5SMtrmxAg,fR4cDsEoYJr04fXkoi0kfA,Very nice facility. Some of the staff were great and others need a swift kick in the tail. The VA has far too much nepotism and needs to clean house.,4

It takes a long time to get an appointment and they sometimes change your appointment time with very short notice. Parking is TERRIBLE! Plan on getting here at least 30 minutes early to allow time to find a parking spot and still get checked-in on time.,3

I show up early as requested and get in late  both times I have been here, and by the way, both times they changed my appointment dates. I'm thinking they need to do a better job on there appointments.  Told the nurses and doctors I have never had so many appointments rescheduled between the clinic and the hospital.  All told me the we are very busy. 

Maybe they should see how a civilian hospital controls the appointment system. 

I was in the VA system in from another state.  The doctors here (at the hospital) pretty much discount everything the VA has done for me up to this point.  There is no need for the follow-ups as recommended by a VA doctor from another state.

Not impressed.",2
1369474,0YNkwW8apDHdFhDH8uimHA,fR4cDsEoYJr04fXkoi0kfA,"State of the art medical equipment. Advanced facility. Very easy to get to and the emergency room is easily accessible. I haven't been seen here yet but I know someone who has been seen a few times now. The staff is great, they make you feel comfortable and welcome and do everything they can to set you at ease. The waiting room is comfortable and has a large flat screen TV. There is access to vending machines with both bad and healthy snacks as well as the much needed coffee. Gave it 4 stars because the emergency room wait is long. Longer than your average emergency room wait. But this should improve with the addition of 20 rooms which they are working on as I type.",4

Even my dad who is 87 said he could not be receiving better care . In regards to his issues they would not release him until they were certain all was well. Thanks VA.

Took my son here a few times because it was close to my house and it was very clean and nice looking inside. The first time I went the doctor barely spent anytime with us and walked into the room wearing house slippers.... Red flag!! Nevertheless we went back a few months later bc my son was I'll again. This time the doctor who saw us wasn't actually a doctor but a pa instead. We thought my son had strep throat he looked at him for two seconds and said he would prescribe him antibiotics. I asked well does he have strep throat? The pa said I don't know and prescribed antibiotics anyway..... Pretty sure you are supposed to swab his throat and test it. When I questioned him about this he replied with a rude and snarky comment. We will never return here again. Nice exterior but inside the staff has no clue what's going on, from the front desk receptionist constantly playing on her phone, to the tatted up nurses, to the doctors and pa's with a bad bedside manner.

Although the doctor I saw the second time was different from the first, she was very warm and friendly. I was happy with the service I received in person, but the follow-up calls really impressed me.

I went for back pain that I'd had for about 3 months. I mentioned an UTI that I'd had recently and the entire conversation I had with the doctor (Angelita Tan-Torres) was about the UTI and not the pain I was actually there for. She seemed like she didn't even want to sit down to hear anything I had to say. Her pen was erect and ready to write a prescription as soon as she walked in the room.
She sent me away with antibiotics for a condition that she thinks I MAY have. (??)

After asking the nurse if the antibiotics were going to help me with my pain, the nurse went into the hallway to ask if she could give me something for my pain she told her 'NO!', as if my pain meant nothing to her. The nurse came in to tell me I wasn't going to be given anything (no Tylenol, no Ibuprofen, NOTHING) the Dr. called her back and told her to give me a shot for the pain. Other than that they were sending off my urine sample and I needed to follow up elsewhere.
I asked how long the shot would help my pain, the nurse told me apprx. 12 hours. I asked what was I supposed to do when the pain come back, and I was told to come back tomorrow if it came back.

It is QUITE UNLIKELY that I'd ever come back to this place!

BTW, The shot did NOT work and I am STILL in pain. I'm too scared to go somewhere else, because even if I was given something for the pain, I wouldn't know if the interaction between the two would effect me poorly because they neglected to even tell me WHAT THE SHOT WAS!

1394689,yC64293Uj9sTtu3d-IX4Pg,h9PzJgONngAbpqEja0BWIg,"My experience at Urgent Extra Care started out well, but by the end I was livid. The two women at the front desk were friendly when greeting my partner and I, and were thorough in explaining the paperwork. I paid for services up front, filled out and turned in all of the paperwork, and waited for less than 10 minutes before we were called back to an exam room.

After about ten minutes in there, the physician assistant briskly walked in, her eyes on the ground in front of her, mumbling her introduction. She never looked me or my partner in the eyes or shook our hands to get our names. After about 5 minutes of chatting with my partner about his issue, she informed him that he has bronchitis and she will be putting him on antibiotics and steroids. I mentioned to her that when I came to Urgent Care Extra about 9 months ago, I was given a shot of antibiotics along with the oral prescription in order to expedite healing, and asked if he would be able to get a shot of antibiotics today, as well. She said ""sure"" and left the room. 

About 5 minutes later, an assistant of some sort (I am assuming this is what he was; he didn't introduce himself by name or by title) came in and told my partner to roll over. He gave him a forceful shot in the butt cheek (which was weird.. I didn't remember my antibiotic shot being done like that), told us his medications would be brought in the room soon, handed me a survey to fill out, and then he left. 

I filled out the survey (everything being positive, except for the PA's non eye contact and lack of proper introduction) and anxiously anticipated us receiving the medications so we could pay for them and go. Fifteen minutes passed by and still nothing. I opened the door and stood in the doorway, eventually being seen by this assistant. He says, ""I am just waiting on a signature by the PA"". About five minutes later, he received it and he then brought the medications into the room. Handing them to my partner, I was astounded when he stated: ""The directions for the medications are in the bag"". My jaw dropped to the floor. 

When he walked out of the room, I exchanged a few words with my partner, and then ran out of the room to get the assistant's attention. Once I did, I told him I would like to speak to the PA about the directions. (I have NEVER been given medications or a prescription for medications by any healthcare professional followed by a ""the directions are in the bag""). What was his response? ""She's busy right now"".

I flew to the front of the office to purchase the medications, and when the receptionist repeated the cost, this assistant overheard her and said, ""No, there's another $20 that needs to be on there because he got an injection of steroids"". I said, ""What?! I asked for an injection of antibiotics, not steroids!"" And he just said, ""Well, the PA ordered steroids"". 

At this point, I was seeing red. So, I paid for the medications and quickly left, vowing to never return.",1

Dr Joe was the one who checked on me during my visit and he was very attentive and informative; going over my urine analysis and was able to give answers for questions i had. The PA (or whatever you call her position) who checked my blood pressure was very friendly as well!,5
1394691,5XfchGdbI0c-gK4xpWyU_g,h9PzJgONngAbpqEja0BWIg,"My usual place was closed on Saturday so I checked out this place. Was nice and clean, quiet and only a few people there. I saw a PA, which was fine cause I just wanted a strep test for my sore throat. Would have preferred a doctor if something more serious. Got some meds and throat numbing stuff. Didn't take long and the PA was good considering. I'd go back for minor stuff.",4
1394692,kcg8rdv8toVr8-rzjnXySg,h9PzJgONngAbpqEja0BWIg,Even one star is too many for them. I've been sitting here for 90 minutes right now and still have not been seen when there was only 4 people before me. They have one person working front desk and one nurse...,1

What place takes your insurance information & asks to keep a credit card on file?  This place does, don't go for a physical because they REFUSE to take your insurance & DEMAND A CASH PAY!!

1394694,KtODLUdxsvNknXrpu7ojLA,h9PzJgONngAbpqEja0BWIg,"I have been to this location twice now and my experiences have been equally bad. First they call the person seeing you the ""provider"" but I don't know why they can't just be honest and say it's a physician assistant because that's what they are. Regardless, I went in to be seen for what I thought was an allergic reaction when the ""provider"" saw me, he barely listened to my symptoms and kept interrupting me saying ""ohh I bet you had tropical fruit in a salad huh?"" Or ""you had nuts didn't you?"", when I just told him what I had eaten he was almost saying he didn't believe me. Then when I went on to say that I've had an allergy test done 3 months ago he said it was wrong and I needed another one. The visit was literally 5 minutes with zero answers. After begging for bloodwork or SOMETHING he finally wrote me a slip. He giggled and didn't listen and looked around the room like a lost puppy rather then a provider. Being in the medical field this urgent care seems more like ""practice"" for these PAs than a real urgent care. To top it off, when I got labs done I called later on to see if I could add some more on due to it being the same time as my yearly blood work and the front desk staff told me ""oh just tell quest they can add it"". When I went to ask at quest the lady was appalled that I was told that because that's illegal to change a doctors order. Just all around a mess.",1

1418134,IPcg0ZjAnfh-Zw6UVVgR_A,_izZ_euPbjphpiobMkLzSw,"I am shocked that this place doesn't have their own entry yet.  Time to change that because while this facility is part of Scottsdale Healthcare Osborn, it is a stand alone facility with everything you need in one locations.

I am currently 9 months pregnant with my first so this review is based on my four experiences with complications I had that lead me to the triage department and a four day stay at Labor and Delivery.  

One of the best things about this facility is that it is stand alone from the hospital.  You have your own building away from the hustle and bustle of the main hospital.  You have your own entrance, your own triage center, and your own staff specific to OB which helps in having nurses and aides who understand what you are going through.  

When you come in they are quick to get you checked in and taken back to the triage area.  There are about 7-8 beds in triage and a staff dedicated to that area.  3 out of 4 times I had amazing staff in the triage area of the facility.  The only poor experience is when they didn't believe the information I was relaying based on when my personal doctor told me.  This was rectified the next day by a very stern phone call from my regular OB.  They are extremely helpful in getting you comfortable, hooked up to the monitors, and assisting your through out your stay.  Three out of the four times I was in triage for a couple of hours, monitored, treated, and sent home.  The fourth time I was admitted.  Attached to the triage center is 2 operating rooms for c-sections.  Again one stop shop.

The facility has a level 2 nursery on site if needed but they encourage the baby to room in with mom.  Be for-warned, if you have a preemie baby or one with complications they may be transferred up to the Shea site which has the the level 3 NICU.

The Labor and Delivery rooms are spacious and are equipped with everything you need to labor and deliver in.  The private bathroom has a shower and a jet tub to help you relax.  I spent four nights on L&D for pre-term labor and hooked up to several IV's.  The on-call doctors and nurses were beyond wonderful and accommodating to us while we were there.  They explained all of the procedures I was facing and what meds did what and how I would react to them.  They bought me a table top fan to help with the overheating side effects from the meds.  I felt like I was demanding at times but they said I was a pretty easy patient.  Dr. Moon was my on call doctor over the weekend and she was thorough, engaging, and extremely helpful.

I did not have a single nurse ratchet during my stay.  Some were not necessarily as talkative as others but all had very good bedside manner and were polite.  The rooms are private and spacious although I do know that the post labor rooms are a little smaller.  It is very quiet and I hardly ever saw or heard any other patients unless I was in triage.  The hospital food is okay...it's hospital food, but they are okay with you bringing in outside food.  

While It stinks that I've already had so many experiences there already, it puts my mind at ease knowing that I will be well cared for when I go in to active labor. 

Highly recommended.",5
1418135,4QqObSE0a9SfBTuvYhMOWg,_izZ_euPbjphpiobMkLzSw,"LOVE LOVE LOVE The Family Birthing Suites at Scottsdale Osborn.  I checked in at 3 pm on June 10th - separate building from hospital.  After talking with the DR on call, we decided that the best course of action, for me and my son, was for me to have a c-section.  

Baby C was born at 6:01pm.  8lb 10oz, 21inches long, Healthy, and Screaming!  LOL
This birthing center is nice and private.  At most, there's 12 mamas on the floor.  Makes for lots of personal attention and you don't feel like just another number.  

I will say that 95% of the staff was wonderful.  The 5% being the night shift staff I had my 2nd night.  TERRIBLE!  The Aid was pretty much nonexistent.  And well the RN on her first hour on shift, she's trying to ""Help"" my son nurse.  She's not only man-handling my boobs, but shoving my sons face into my tit.  Baby C is screaming and I'm getting frustrated.  Then the nurse starts in with her agenda - her formula pushing agenda.  My husband was ready to cave, but I told her to give us (my son and I) 5 minutes.  She left the room.  I was able to get Baby C calmed down and latched on.  Without shoving my boob into his face/mouth.  But that didn't stop her belittling my efforts.  All night long, I was beaten down with her formula pushing as Baby C was waking up every 2 or so hours to nurse.   I ignored her every time and said each time, ""well his pediatrician (who had saw Baby C and I that first day) said that my body knows what to do, and I'm producing colostrum...which is all he needs right now.  My milk will come in in a few days.  And that I need to nurse to get my milk to come in.""  This horrid nurse would always say, ""he's hungry..that's why he's crying.  You should really give him formula.""   

Nurse Ratchet came in at 6am making her final rounds, and again I was nursing Baby C.  She finally says to me, ""Well you're getting a lot of practice.""  I seriously wanted to bitch slap this C You Next Tuesday.  After having little to no sleep, I lost it and started weeping.  She asked if I was alright and I said YUP.  She knew I had hit my breaking point and left.  I then began to sob uncontrollably.  I called my mom, who could bairly understand me over the sobs.  I called J, who also couldn't understand me.  But both made it a point to hurry up and get down to the Birthing Center.  Thankfully, the wonderful team I had my first day was back on shift.  The Aid came and said, as she walked in the door, ""How's my superstar (I according to them had been an ideal patient...moving around the room, tending to baby, and walking the hall every few hours with Baby C...letting him get some sun from the skylights in the halls.  Apparently they have to practically drag other new moms out of bed.) this morning?!""  Then when she saw the emotional state I was in, ""OMG are you alright?  What's wrong!?""  I cried on her shoulder for a good 20 minutes.  She reassured me and she said she would notify the nursing supervisor of what happened.  Baby C's pediatrician was making rounds and stopped by while the Aid was getting my vitals.  I addressed what happened over night, and said that if that nurse and aid was going to be back on shift, that I wanted to get Baby C and I discharged (if all my dr's approved).  Dr G. was outraged at what happened!!  She's pro-breastfeeding.  So Dr. G went and paid a visit to the nursing supervisor.  I was happy to hear that Nurse Ratchet and her sidekick were not going to be returning that evening.  

My RN that day was Ruth.  OMG.  RUTH = AWESOME  She's been an RN for at least 50 years and her bedside manner proved it.  She's wonderful.  She knew I had a rough night and wanted Baby C and I to get a nice nap.  So she let me nurse C and came in a few minutes after we finished up, with a bottle of lotion.  Baby C was already asleep.  I'm tellin you, I got the best backrub of my life that morning.  And J said I was out like a light within minutes.  

So there you have it.  From one end of the spectrum to the other.  Ruth vs. Nurse Ratchet.  

The facility = 5 stars
The staff = depends on who you get.  
Nurse Ratchet and her sidekick Aid = Negative Stars
The rest of the staff = 5+ Stars!

I'm going to go ahead and give 5 stars.",5
1418136,n3QBOnomlQFQ5u4kVrE96g,_izZ_euPbjphpiobMkLzSw,"At first I was skeptical to have my baby at Osborn since they did not have a nigh enough level of NICU compared to Scottsdale Shea but after speaking to my OB/GYN I decided that I would have my son at this hospital. Since it is a smaller birthing suites, I was told we would not be rushed in and out as compared to Scottsdale Shea. 

When I was 8 months pregnant I was omitted to triage due to a kidney infection and had to remain at the birthing suites for a week. Every nurse and doctor that I came across was beyond friendly and helpful. I felt so much compassion coming from all of them it made my stay ok. The rooms there were all spacious and nice. Even the food was great! After a 2 week bed rest at home, I was once again omitted back to the hospital for another kidney infection (drink lots of water!!!!!) and again remained at the hospital for a week. This time I ended up giving birth and my son was taken to the NICU where he remained for 3 weeks. All of the NICU nurses were so kind and accommodating. I know with my next children I will have them at Osborn.  I cannot say enough great things about this hospital and the nurses. 

A few weeks later I did have to take my son to the PICU (pediaterics NICU) at Scottsdale Shea and I could see such a difference between the two hospitals. The nurses there were hit and miss. Some were very nice and helpful, others were very mean and made my husband and I feel so uncomfortable there. If I ever need to go to a children's hospital again I will to to Phoenix Children's Hospital instead of Shea.",5

Plenty of parking in the parking lot. Facility is 24/7 visiting hours, but East side door locks at 8pm so you have to enter from the North.  Also ALWAYS check for RSV season. You don't understand how much it sucks to drive an hour or two out there with kids to find out it's RSV season and kids who are not immediate family are banned.  Although understandable, don't want to get the newborns sick so whatever the staff says, goes!",5
1423764,MgzVt8tYegiz3NW4rDIZhQ,ygxnaDJvt0LnqwPD2NDpiw,"Had to rush Baby C over to CCMC on Sunday as he was having difficulty breathing.  We've been down the respiratory issue path with Baby C a few times.  That and I have my own asthma/allergy issues...so I know how to treat him.  When everything I had done in the past wasn't working (breathing treatments, steam shower, back to back treatments), I threw my hands up.  I knew my limitations and knew it was time to have him looked at.  

The ER for Cardon's is in the same location as Banner Desert.  However, Peds is on one side and the other side is for non Ped patients.  Within minutes of walking in and checking in, Baby C was being rushed back, having vitals taken and getting a plan of action.  

Thought he was going to have to be admitted, but we dodged that bullet.  The Dr and RT (actually all of the staff) that was looking after him were great.  Heck, one of the staff members even brought him in a toy to play with (wasn't sure if it was 100% clean, so I gave it a good wipe down first).  But seriously..how cool is that.  They made sure I had everything i needed while we were there - which was about 9 hours in total.  Did I need water?  No problem.  Needed to run to the restroom and have someone watch Baby C?  No problem.  Did I need something to nosh on?  Here, have some snacks.  

Never do I want to step foot in a Children's Hospital.  BUT, if I have to, I'm going to make sure from now on it's Cardon Childrens Medical Center (we've been to PCH once - back in November..was not really a good experience).",4
1423765,PzHXbHOmEr1jREhCj86vig,ygxnaDJvt0LnqwPD2NDpiw,"I wouldn't take my son here if it were the last hospital in earth. We were admitted here when he was 3 days old with severe jaundice. The first nurse was friendly but seemed like her and her other little nurse friend were fresh out of school and knew basically nothing. This nurse couldn't figure out how to turn on the bilirubin lights,  my mom had to tell her and as we would find it later she turned it to the wrong setting. The doctor came in 3 times and never caught this as well as a plethora of nursing staff who were vastly inexperienced with little to no bedside manner.

  It wasn't until our very last night that the nurse on staff introduced herself and explained the game plan. This is when we found out the list of things the other nurses had done wrong. I was very upset about this and let the nurse know, I'm guessing she either noted it in my son's chart or spoke to the doctor directly because the next morning the doctor came in and her demeanor was completely different with us. She would dismiss all of our concerns and sent my son home after his bilirubin levels had risen over night.I questioned her on this and she said she was ""fine with it"". 

That afternoon my son stopped eating, a few hours later he became unresponsive and we were admitted directly to the NICU at Chandler Regional who's staff and doctors were amazing. My son had to be retreated for jaundice for two more days and was treated for an infection that was completely overlooked at Cardons. Following this experience I got to have fun with their immaculately incompetent billing department. Over nearly 7 months I filed 3 different grievances and spent hours on the phone with multiple departments only to be told by the last person I spoke to that there was no record of any grievance.

 The ONLY nice thing I can say is this last person actually did her job and filed my grievance. They wrote off my entire bill and refunded the cash I had paid at the hospital, something I hadn't even requested, and informed me the doctor would be brought before a review board, not sure if that every actually happened but it's nice to know she didn't get a penny from us.

My husband and I decided that he needed to go to the ER to get assessed because he woke up in the morning with these large bumps on both of his legs just beneath his knees. His legs swollen, tender, and very red and hot to the touch. He began to develop raised bumps on his chest, back, and arms. It seemed to progress pretty quickly. My husband never complains about anything and absolutely avoids Dr's and would never dream of an ER visit unless he thought something was seriously wrong. I am a Registered Nurse and specialize in med/surg and after monitoring him throughout the day we decided to go down and be seen. I'm not positive but I thought it may be Erythema Nodosum, but I cannot diagnose of course, that would be up to the Dr. 
He checked in and was triaged very quick and then brought back to one of the beds. A male nurse came inland asked what was going on and we explained his signs and symptoms and gave a detailed report over the last 24 hours. The nurse was not paying attention at all while we talking. He did not do anything other then a quick glance and then exited the room. 
Next the Dr came in and paid even less attention then  the nurse. Now the Dr just stood for a minute and she did not assess my husband or even slightly exam the affected areas. Now my husband had flu like symptoms over the last few weeks and had generalized fatigue. The Dr did not ask for any history, did not do an exam, and turned and left the room without saying one thing to us or even give us an opinion as to what it could be.
I never mention that I'm a nurse when I go to the Dr or clinc or wherever  as that could work against us.Wells a few minutes later the nurse came back in with discharge papers and an Rx for two antibiotics ( Keflex and Bactrim) as well as a oral prednisone.  No information, no exam, no review of history of other acute symptoms and he was handed his paperwork and said we could go. My husband was so mad because he was given no information and no medical advise at all. We asked the RN if we really were being released and the nurse said ""what would you like us to do"" Nice bedside manner you uncaring idiot. 
We left, husband very upset and "" we need your $125.00 co-pay""
Even if it was something minor we should have at least been educated and given a rational for the antibiotics Now anyone in the medical field with direct patient care knows how important education is. Had we been just two people  with no medical back ground, we should have at least been informed on the importance of taking the antibiotics as prescribed, even when you are feeling better. Wow! Medication such as antibiotics have to be completed properly and many patients do not know this. So much for quality care and we will never use this ""hospital"" again. 
Absolutely horrible service and care. 
Hopes this helps even one person if they have a choice where to receive care.",1

I have been to this place 2 times, both completely a huge waste of money and time.

- = Visit 1 = -
Wife was 5 weeks pregnant and was having some severe hives and sweats, I was very worried so I wanted to play it safe so I said lets go to the emergency room. There were maybe 2 people in the lobby with us but it still took hours to get in. They did some checking and suggested doing an ultrasound, since the baby was barely along they had to do the invasive one (camera on a rod basically). The doctor came in quite a while later basically saying we lost the baby because the edges of the egg were ""fuzzy"", saying there was nothing we could do.
Basically we were devastated, she went to her OB and they did blood work and said everything was fine, I am happy to say that our daughter is turning 1 today and is perfectly healthy.

- = Visit 2 = -
Just a couple days ago we went back because our 1 year old is walking but not an expert yet and fell with a sippy cup in her mouth, basically knocked out her 2 front teeth. We rushed to the emergency room, why I have no idea, still waited 4 hours. But we wanted x-rays done to make sure that everything was still ok and there were no teeth broken off in there.
They did the x-rays, which was a MASSIVE ordeal, the tech was very slow and taking his time and it took 30 min to get 3 pics because by the time he moseyed himself over to the button she was not in the EXACT position he wanted so we had to do it several times.
But in the end the DR said that the teeth are completely gone and the gums and stuff are all good (sorry for the stuff, I cant remember the medical names), basically saying everything is good.
We go home and after a couple days the blood clears and she is perfectly happy 1 year old playing with her big sister, but when she laughs we can see her gums and the gap, and guess what, we take her to a child dentist and yep, BOTH TEETH are still there! THE WHOLE TEETH, Idk who is looking at the x-rays, but they may need some glasses.

Sum Up
So in short this place has done nothing but charge my insurance company and myself a ton of money to completely lie to us.
The ONLY positive was the nurses, they were very nice.

So in my opinion only if your not going to make it to the next hospital, that should be the only time you stop here, even then I may take my chances.",1
1440302,o-hldvvYH8s4iMczEAeTjg,XbhwzKDj7uSIhQo1vj_6Lw,"In 2011, I arrived at the West Valley Hospital with a gunshot wound to my left leg. At the time I arrived at that hospital's Emergency Room, there were absolutely no other patients. I sat in one of their chairs with a large towel on my leg, wincing, for no less than thirty minutes after having signed in. While waiting, I noted that there were two nurses sitting at the front desk watching tv. Not to add an air of humor to this incident, but as we (myself and three acquaintances) waited in the ER ""lounge"" they attempted to commence having a conversation with me. As my ears were ringing quite badly (keeping in mind that this was a gunshot wound, and guns are by nature very loud), I replied by stating ""WHAT? I CAN'T HEAR YOU! MY EARS ARE RINGING BECAUSE OF THE GUNSHOT!"" This elicited calls from one of the nurses to ""try to keep [my] voice down."" Fifteen minutes after I arrived, signed in and indicated the nature of my injury, one of the nurses stood up and stated ""well, time for me to look like I'm doing something"", and walked away. Ten minutes after that, another nurse arrived at the front desk and was confronted by an acquaintance of mine who had accompanied me. when advised of the nature of my injury, the nurse asked two questions: the first being ""a WHAT?"", this quickly was followed not by ""is his blood pressure dropping?"" or ""does he have any secondary injuries?"" or anything of the sort, but by the question of ""DOES HE HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE"" which was answered in the negative due to unemployment. This received the response of ""WELL, THEN, HE'LL HAVE TO WAIT. WE HAVE OTHER PATIENTS WHO ARE INSURED."" Fifteen minutes after that little jewel, I was finally ushered into one of the examination rooms. The secondary examination involved a nurse prodding the wound with her little finger, verbalizing the word ""eww"", and summoning the doctor who, in turn, told me that he was not about to try to stitch the gunshot hole closed as it ""would take too much of his time."" Instead, I was given a trial sized packet of aspirin, a trial sized tube of Neosporin, two bandaids, and four pieces of three inch long by two inch wide gauze. Further treatment involved encouraging me to obtain a catheter tube, rinsing some warm water through it, and using it to flush remaining gun powder out of the wound to prevent infection. I later attempted to file for AHCCCS to cover the cost of the treatment, but was told by the hospital that they would ""encourage AHCCCS to decline the application."" As this wound was due to the firing of a gun, the police were required by law to investigate the issue, which meant that they had to travel to the site where the gunshot occurred (they did) and interview myself and the three acquaintances which came with me to the hospital (they did this as well.) As a matter of fact, the interviewing of the witnesses and investigation at the scene was more time consuming than the ""treatment"" I received at the hospital. While the doctors and nurses were less than eager to treat me, the hospital's billing department could not wait to bill me for the expense of (again) two bandaids, 2 pieces of gauze, Neosporin and some aspirin) to the tune of $396.00. I have tried, on multiple (no less than five) occasions to speak with the patient advocate regarding this matter, but have been repeatedly ignored if not laughed at by hospital staff. The attitude of the staff at the West Valley Hospital is by far the most horrendous I have ever seen. Had this been a life-threatening injury wherein I had bled to death in the ER waiting room, there is no doubt in my mind that the personnel would throw a bill of charges at, and demand payment from, my corpse. At any rate, I have requested an audience with the patient advocate and anyone else at that hospital who would listen. Each time I have been (somewhat joyously, I might add) ping-ponged between agencies to the tune of ""we don't know the answer to that question, call this person at extension XXXX""- This has been going on for three years. I have grown tired of the uncaring, disingenuous, and unprofessional manner in which the West Valley Hospital operates. I've seen better hospitals in so-called ""third-world"" countries.",1

In general all seemed to go well on the surgery. The procedure was done and I have not had any complications as of yet (~23 days out from surgery). So I can only assume that the staff is coherent and clean (sorry, I was knocked out so I can't judge).

The only thing I can knock them for is scheduling. I was originally scheduled for a 2pm surgery. Then the day before thy called to confirm and said it was scheduled for 4pm (didn't even mention that it was moved, just confirmed a different time). Then at 11am on surgery day they called and asked if I wanted to come in early (which I didn't since I was not allowed to drive myself in and had made plans for someone to get me). Then I get there for my 4pm surgery and I am not taken back for my surgery at 6pm.

My point is that you can't change times on the fly. With a surgery such as mine you have to arrange for someone to drive you there. If you and your driver are waiting at home, fine. But if you are asking people to take off work or drive over to pick you up this is not efficient at all. Then if they are driving you home, and you have surgery 4 hours after the original time then this could potentially mess up your schedule for getting home, etc.

This is all aggravating and luckily I had someone pick me up that was flexible with their time and had someone to pick me up that was flexible with their time.

The staff is friendly, dedicated, and highly professional.  I was greeted with a smile upon arrival.  Questions are invited and answered in understandable terms. Pain management is proactive and effective.  The building is beautiful, the food is excellent, and the infection rate is very low.  I would heartily recommend this facility to anyone requiring orthopedic care.",5

1521075,NbVD-ybQrM2Zuc40Koz1nA,NoCMIKfpJGmJ9OI0u7IZ0A,"Very good experience for a bad situation.  Got in quickly, loved dr Layton.   I didn't like being moved from a bed to a recliner in the ""holding"" area. I could see if they were busy and needed the bed but they weren't, although the morphine quickly fixed that situation.  I guess it was so they could condense the pts to one nurse, which makes sense.  CT and XRay guys were great.  Very kind and friendly.  Reception area was clean and check in woman was professional yet kind, friendly, and informative.  If I wasn't in serious pain I would have enjoyed the experience and if I'm ever in need oe emergency services again I will return.",4
