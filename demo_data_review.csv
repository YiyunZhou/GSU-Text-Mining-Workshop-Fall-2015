141900,DsBDwdCCsdHclqRn81hY1A,AFDFOs2GaIyUArGyEUDQzQ,"I have been coming here for a long time. However with time passing, so does this restaurant. When floors looked nice, bathrooms were presentable and smelled decent, and looked clean, for the past 3 years.. my folks love the won-ton mein, but the rest of the restaurant is horrible. I can't stand coming to this restaurant. It was only a few days ago when my mom said ""we aren't coming here anymore."" I have to make a review of this restaurant. The floors looked like they were going to remodel it, but never got the chance or they'd rather keep the money to themselves. Maybe get paid higher, and avoid the floor costs. The floor has been looking like it was a road in a chinese village since 2 years ago. I remember they were changing ownerships, which could be the reason to be the downfall of this restaurant. The broth for the noodle soup had no taste at all. the floors are blackened, and i had seen a waiter drop the napkins and chopsticks on the dirty, yet blackened floor. You would think he would put them in the dirty bin, yet he blew on the chopsticks wiped them with a cloth and put them back in the drawer. he also fanned out the napkins and put them back as well. OMG i just wanted to puke. What they should do? In my opinion, if it was my restaurant. Get someone to clean the restroom on an hourly basis to refill the amenities. Also downsize the restaurant, so you can afford to get flooring. If not carpet, some cheap tiles. Maybe keep the size of the restaurant and lease half of it to a boba place so then you can finally afford to fix the flooring, and maybe have a decent bathroom. I had to wait til we left and headed to rio, so i could use the restroom. Avoid this at all costs. You rather go and get some mc donalds or pho!",1
141901,IPU5myAXlLxe-IRiOE4w7w,AFDFOs2GaIyUArGyEUDQzQ,"Lunch (11am-5pm) & Late Night Specials (for $4.95, and the portions are generous, definitely the right spot to hit up for decent hot meal on a glacial global economic recovery budget.  That was how I felt about the economy back in 2011. Vegas has definitely recovered a lot from the dismal lows, but not really back to what it was before the crash.  So I continue to seek out decent restaurants that is budget friendly, and Café Noodle & Chinese Barbeque continues to be near the top of my list for curing hunger on a tight budget.

Like many other Yelpers have mentioned, the restaurant is not the cleanest.  Even after clearing a recently vacated table and sanitizing it, it still feels not quite clean. Maybe it is that lingering thin film of grease or they simply needed to use a cleaner rag to clean the tables.  Well, at least the utensils and tea cups are clean.

Anyway, I ended up here at Cafe Noodle and Chinese Barbeque, a restaurant that I have walked past numerous times to other businesses in this super busy plaza with the ridiculously inadequate parking spaces. However, the American name is completely foreign to me, and to locate it I had to look up the driving direction.  The place was relatively crowded at 11pm on a Tuesday night, and pretty much every patron was Asians.  I immediately sensed a good vibe that this place must be at least decent.

After looking over the menu, I opted for the Salt & Pepper Chicken Wings appetizer (tasty but on the greasy side, occasionally not very flavorful due to insufficient amount of ""salt & pepper"") and the Pan Fried Noodles with Beef and Vegetable (very large portion and pretty flavorful).  The food is not high end, but for the prices they are charging you, it is well worth it.  That was from my very first visit back in 2011, and the incomplete review draft sat and sat and sat some more until now.

So two years have gone by and several visits later (both dine-in and take-out), my impression remained roughly the same.  Service for the most part is their weak point.  Not the friendliest or most attentive, but occasionally you will get a waiter that stepped up his game (a refreshing change). Then there are times when you end up standing there for 5 minutes wanting to place an order and be completely ignored by the lady behind the counter and ultimately walk out and head across the street to another near 24/7 Chinese restaurant that is just as good, if not better.

The food at great value is what keeps me coming back once I get over their latest service mishaps. 
What I do recommend here:
* 2 BBQ Items Combo on Rice (I usually get their BBQ Duck and Soya Chicken) - it will set up back $8.75
* Spicy Eggplant Hot Pot - one of my favorites
* Salted Fish & Chicken Fried Rice - I usually get this to go plus something else. Slightly adventurous due to the salted fish.
* Any of their Pan Fried Flat Rice Noodle dishes - but sometimes it is a little greasy, so drink plenty of hot tea!
* Crispy Fried Chicken (all day special dine-in only offer for $5.95 each) - that is a very sweet and filling deal!

From 3PM to 5PM, they have a limited ""High Tea"" menu, customers get a free HK style milk tea or coffee (hot or cold) along with your order. Not an awesome promo, but if you have to pay for said complimentary beverage it will cost you $2.50.  

NOTE: In their recent Chinese newspaper ads, they have all day specials from $4.95 to $7.95, but I have never tested that during normal dinner time.

Minimum for credit card use is $15, so order enough or bring cash.

Review #1 of 2014. Checked!",4
141902,7cNV7l_VpNBghK5NlWWV7Q,AFDFOs2GaIyUArGyEUDQzQ,"Our family discovered this restaurant last years. We liked the. Simple Chinese food and the prices were inexpensive. We just visited this cafe twice in a week. The first trip we found a used tea bag in the tea pot  the server gave us. I brought it to the Manager attention and he apologized sincerely. he explained that sometimes customers bring their own tea bag into the restaurant. Since we enjoyed the food, we decided to let the matter rest. Two days later, we visited this restaurant again. The food was reasonably tasty. However, when we asked for the bill, that is when our entire experience went down the drain! We normally do not check the items listed on the receipt and like many we merely pay the total amount as shown. This time for no reason we checked the items listed on the bill and found out shockingly that an item of $3/- was automatically added into the bill without even informing the customer! Normally we leave cash on the table but in this instance we were shocked! how can a waitress or establishment secretly and automatically add on ""tips"" onto the bill and not inform the customer? Also if we did not even notice the ""tips"" we would have double tip bec we always leave 20% behind anyway! When we confronted the waitress and asked how can she do such a secretive billing, she merely tried to cover it up by giving ridiculous reasons ..she explained that when the convention is in town, they always add automatic tip onto every customer bill. Such practice left us totally disgusted and we pledged we will not visit this establishment ever. We learn now to check every item on the bill because you never know what extra item can be added. 

Alash a cheating waitress drove away future customer business...what a shame!",1
141903,Hh0yaiXQZ46X5wsF_AAx2Q,AFDFOs2GaIyUArGyEUDQzQ,"horrible experience ! This restaurant makes us feel like they are dishonest. One waitress appears very very sneaky.  This was our third visit and our waitress was very rude. she talked to us with disrespect and treated us like crap,! we just sat down and wanted to have a peaceful dinner. then when she handed us our bill which  we found out that the waitress added a few dollars tip without informing the us.  She wrote the amount on our bill! this place is very dishonest. Hiw can they write their own tip onto customer bills without telling the,? we are never going back there again. if you want to risk going there, make sure you check the bill for every item....do not be fooled!",1
141904,TQddgCKAM5F2uo7aBPJolw,AFDFOs2GaIyUArGyEUDQzQ,"Food: 
food was good, not great. 

Price: 
more expensive than other restaurants I've been to. 

Service: 
The guy who took my order (take out) seemed too serious and uptight, but the woman who gave me my order was friendly. 

Overall, would not come back.",3
141905,O80rCz1TTMbtbaEmH_Lc7A,AFDFOs2GaIyUArGyEUDQzQ,"1) Generous portion great for big party. 
2) Price is good for Vegas.
3) Not much of a wait for lunch and dinner
4) Service is good from the waitresses that's if you don't get the owner helping you, she is very mean. 
5) Tables are sticky so make sure you wipe down before setting your arms on top of it.",4
141906,wrvDVk6HCDBfYE1SfN92cQ,AFDFOs2GaIyUArGyEUDQzQ,"Great prices and great specials $4.95 beef with prayer sauce was very good and good sized portion. $4.95 mandarin pork was good as well again good sized portion. Both dishes could of easily been a filling meal but for that price me and the gf figured the portion has to be small we better order another dish.

 She got the shrimp and pork wonton soup which was ok not the greatest. They didn't skip on the wontons like some places do it probably had 5 or 6 good sized ones. It also had rice noodles and bok choy mixed in. I order the $5.95 bbq pork and noodles which was ehh not to favorable. You can tell them to make the noodles spicier if desired. We only finished one dish between the two of us and took the rest home.

The service was pretty good not the greatest but better then most places. Not the type of place to take Someone you're trying to impress but great for a quick bite. Complimentary tea was a plus and the food arrived very fast. Me and the gf were very impressed as we weren't expecting much from this place we were just looking for a late night meal after work. We will prob be regulars here in the future.",4
141907,y7lIeD4YvV3VYQ7oxj0JGA,AFDFOs2GaIyUArGyEUDQzQ,"Worst food and service, I asked them to bring me an ice water 3 times, I have to go get the menu by myself, the answer was They are busy, it was only 3 tables with 2 servers,how busy would be?  and every time I went always see the woman counted her money for 30 mins, ""Don't go to this place"", the staff speaks loud with bad words in front of the guest..",1
141908,gehXYG3RwJQWNTPq6ttI8A,AFDFOs2GaIyUArGyEUDQzQ,"In a rush but don't want to go to a fast food restaurant? Budget is tight? Then this is the place! Price to beat! Food is tasty and portions are large. Quick service and friendly staff. We come here mostly after midnight because the place can be packed during the day. The place could use some major renovations, though. But overall, I like it!",4
141909,Ar8Buoe34ueCXhyYFq-8Yg,AFDFOs2GaIyUArGyEUDQzQ,Service is bad and also the food here are awful. Prob is one of the worst Chinese food. Not gonna come back here again.,1
141910,CkU4Zlu66c59fc8R25KJXg,AFDFOs2GaIyUArGyEUDQzQ,Food is good and reasonably priced BUT BEWARE restrooms !!!! Deep clean and sanitize thoroughly as well as the dining area  floors. They are dark colored but steam and strip the floor. Makes you wonder if the kitchen is up to par?!?! They posted A grade rating...really !?! I think they would improve star rating if they made the place more inviting and clean,2
141911,c2blcTBq8cM0OSW2K-9Q2Q,AFDFOs2GaIyUArGyEUDQzQ,"Love the food here but despise the staff. Never friendly, no smiles, no refills, and they give dirty looks. I usually go here after basketball at tark. I enjoy their whole chicken, pan fried noodles, whole sole fish and fried shrimp. They have a discounted menu after 11pm as well. If it wasn't for the tasty food I wouldn't give them my business.",3
141912,2TDGcewWgsJuvnQYMNmHhg,AFDFOs2GaIyUArGyEUDQzQ,Food is good for the price. The place is pretty big with lots of big family table. The lunch menu starts off at 5 dollars ! Very good service for Chinatown!!!! I ordered preserved vegetables with intestines and ma po tofu. Both very authentic! I always take my family here!,4
141913,z6H2Eap7-sH5uHm6S2oXuw,AFDFOs2GaIyUArGyEUDQzQ,"i went here quite often. Most of their food is good. The pork chop is awesome, wonton n suei kiaw soup is wonderful. Beef flat rice noodle is delicious, salt pepper squid is good too. I usually happy w/ their food. Service is so so, depends who ur server is.
Beware!! Their chix wing!! They serve it to me is medium, still bloody!! Gross!!",3
141914,W5WNoVblMiLd664Uewzebg,AFDFOs2GaIyUArGyEUDQzQ,"I must say, this is definitely not on my ""favorite, oh my gosh I love this place"" Chinese joints. I love the price of the stuff here, and I always end up finding myself here to feed a big group of people, or to fix a really really late night craving for Chinese food. 

Service is generally really fast, but the food is normally on the salty side, like ""oh my gosh I can totally taste the MSG"" and I normally get a headache after eating here and I think it's from the seasoning, or just the MSG they add to the meals. The place isn't super clean, but it's not disgusting dirty. I do like the taste of their hot tea here that they serve. 
 
Food is nicely portioned, so like I said, I definitely like the price of everything here especially because they have the ""special price/portioned"" menu. It's easy to feed a party of 10+ more people and end up only paying $10-$15 each if you split the bill'' and you'll have order a shit load of food, like over 6 or 7 dishes. This is a good place to come and eat if you're hungry and you wanna split the bill so you can try everything that's ordered.

They normally do a good job at accommodating very large groups. Bathroom isn't all that clean, so I would suggest hold it if you can. 

Oh and parking is a total bitch in the plaza where this restaurant is located so know you have been warned. When the parking lot is full (which it normally is always full) you have to park in the Chinatown parking lot next to this plaza.",2
141915,MP-mN-HX50J3x9OsRj8q-Q,AFDFOs2GaIyUArGyEUDQzQ,"Been here quite a few times... Always return for their salmon heads in black bean sauce, crispy pork intestines... It's very affordable and I like the food... Mostly for down to earth folk... If you're into fancy stuff, this place isn't for you...",3
141916,NXCQfe0_P4Iq8IapTXQsvA,AFDFOs2GaIyUArGyEUDQzQ,When me and my friends come here we are always seated right away. We always get the pork chops! The prices were decent and the portions are ok.,4

Took a while to get our food.
They have really good prices.
$10 minimum for credit/debit.",2
141919,JJmkoHfWTnpHL2xTgirZig,AFDFOs2GaIyUArGyEUDQzQ,"This place is gross, even for chinese standards, coming from an asian person.  I'm used to bad customer service, especially at chinese restaurants, but these girls take it to a whole another level.  The dining room has the sense of a public bathroom, and their restrooms are absolutely wretched, vomit inducing .  Seriously, put some money into the bathrooms at least.",1
142882,IiWE20cRlJ1YEEcebsxV-g,FV16IeXJp2W6pnghTz2FAw,"My mother REALLY wanted to try this place out when we came to Vegas, despite my arguing against it. There were tons of people waiting for a table, both in the restaurant and outside, so she kept saying ""Well it has to be good since there's so many people here !!"" How I wished that was true.
The wait wasn't too bad. 10~15 minutes.
I got the calamari, and it sucked. Hated it.
We ordered some beef entree and they didn't give it to us until near the end of the meal. Even after several reminders. Idk how the rest of the food was because I was too busy trying to eat the horrible calamari.
My water was only refilled once. 20 minutes after it's been sitting at the edge of the table completely empty. I guess it's not that big of a deal but it is to me. I mean, I would have asked for a refill myself if I could flag someone down but noo they were all running around serving other tables, and being apparently much too busy to attend to our one table.",2
142883,0_xIFMnhD0RZAySzQFQZeA,FV16IeXJp2W6pnghTz2FAw,"I base my reviews on the food, service, and atmosphere. Given that, this place was pretty average for a pho place. The restaurant itself is nicely decorated and large in size. It 's fairly busy every time I've drove passed it. I ordered my usual beef broth with rare flank steak. The broth was in my opinion, very tasty. I didn't need to add too much extra sauces like usual. The prices are a little bit more than I'm use to for the portion, but not too bad. So if you're looking for a good pho spot in Chinatown, Pho Kim Long is a safe bet.",3
142884,OOgIRkNzD_bFif-D0zvBoA,FV16IeXJp2W6pnghTz2FAw,"Pho Kim long. Fun e nam! Don't you think? Well if your a local or party with locals chances are you will probably end up here after a night out for some drunk munchies or after a wicked hangover sets in and your in dire need of liquids containing pho noodles.  The food good. The atmosphere is questionable. If you come here sober you'll probably run into someone you know who is plastered. Fun? Maybe. Enjoyable? That depends if you get anything good to use on them! Jk, sorta. 
Seriously though the food is good. Order something other than the pho you'll be surprised it's pretty damn good! I like the crab Rangoon and the peppered beef. 
Ooo and the Thai boba is yummy! Don't get the fruit flavored ones they use the artificial fruit stuff. 
The seating sucks and the bathroom is not so clean. If you like lots of ppl, a noisy restaurant, and pretty decent food than give pho Kim long a try. What could it hurt. I've def done worse drunk.",3
142885,tX5F2ojH4oBMvAahENXS3A,FV16IeXJp2W6pnghTz2FAw,"Open late for drunk feasting!  Each time I have gone, there was a wait, but it's not too bad. I have ordered the dat biet pho and the chicken pho.  They were both good.  Egg rolls were typical.",3
142886,1A5hjMib_ZHq9ztkqKJmfA,FV16IeXJp2W6pnghTz2FAw,"What! Only 3 1/2 stars?! This place has quality food! Whether you order their amazing pho (I ordered the #10)b or their delicious Kung pao beef, you can't go wrong! Their egg rolls are some of the best I've ever had.",5
142887,Csj0MOyz6HLUvtnXiV-T0Q,FV16IeXJp2W6pnghTz2FAw,"Good lunch spot, although it took some time to get our servers attention. We both ordered Pho and it was delicious. Mine (with various meats) and his (chicken) came out very quickly and had nice flavor. We were seated at a giant round table even though it was just the two of us and our 1 year old. They child seemed to have thrown them off, but overall the experience was good.",3
142888,kf5lQzlbzJV0Y1Z3AeSglw,FV16IeXJp2W6pnghTz2FAw,"excellent food, service was so slow today and they messed up my order. next table had same complaints. staff really odd, took off with my credit card for long time today... i hope i didnt become victim of fraud.  I dont recall service here being slow and rude, but it was definitely not fast or friendly.  Food amazing as before, but lost stars on service. I came around 5pm, saw no drunks or partiers.",3
142889,fktE_cf7IZKqpDYav3G4Sw,FV16IeXJp2W6pnghTz2FAw,"This is an okay place. The prices aren't too hot, but hey, you're in the Las Vegas area so prices will be much more inflated. 

This place seems to be popular with the locals as it was buzzing with people--for a random Thursday during the hours of lunch. The wait isn't that long though so don't fret. Our sever was semi okay, but my friends seemed to think otherwise as he made faces when my friend asked for a substitution. The food was average. I don't think any of us thought it was poorly made or anything great in nature. 

I had some sort of Japanese fried noodle. I really can't remember exactly what it was. It tasted okay, but I thought it was a bit on the oily side. I think other menu item choices would have been better. My friend's fiancee had the pho ga, he said it was good. 

I really like the fact that this restaurant is in the China Town area so you can definitely take your pick of other restaurants. There's plenty of dessert and drink choices to chose from as well.",3

After seeing lines going out the door 3 nights in a row at this restaurant, I decided I had to give this place a try.

The spring rolls were fabulous.
The pho was delicious.
The service was meh. 

The 3 color dessert was horrendous. You get a plastic cup, a mound of shaved ice on top that is impossible to eat with a plastic spoon because the ice hardens, and the green gelatin layer tastes like green hardened rice noodles. The coconut milk, instead of being liquid, freezes with the ice. Quite disappointing, really, to eat such a poorly prepared yet simple dessert.

3 stars. Pretty comfy and bright interior. Food is average and there are a lot of options.",3

142893,tBHkfH49itm-KP6R86KFow,FV16IeXJp2W6pnghTz2FAw,"This place is probably appreciated by those who are hung over. Unfortunately (in more ways than one), we patronized this restaurant sober as a blade of grass. On a Sunday morning, I found this place to be quite dark. Again, the dark would have been appreciated had I been hung over or still buzzing. The pho broth was salty and unbalanced. It tasted like it had too much star anise. 

I was adventurous and ordered the bun bo hue. Huge mistake-- again salty broth, the veggies that normally accompanies this disk appeared sad. The offering of frest mint was very stingy. Instead of cabbage, there were pieces of ripped up lettuce. Sure, they may not have red cabbage, but they could have at least cut up the lettuce nicely.",1

The tour buses regularly bring unknowing tourists to this particular mall strip in Chinatown. They get a lot of good business that way. Poor tourists. 5 minutes down the road are at least 2 better Pho joints with much less inflated prices.",2

Every time i have been there, about 5 or 6 times, the servers have been terrible. Last time i was there, one in my party ordered veggie egg rolls and they said ""no, too busy now"". Really? It wasn't packed. They wait for you to tell them you need your check after everyone has long since finished. I think the kitschy name is what gets most people through the door. Maybe they just bank on the name and good food. Whatever. Maybe I'll get it as takeout next time.",3

Place was beautiful and clean. The Pho was so-so because mine came out pretty salty. Not much different Pho varieties. And I was a little bit confused about service. We didn't have one server we could talk to. There were multiple servers at a time. That makes it hard to ask for something if you needed it, or to get the bill.",3

  Our family  have waited for 30 minute on waiting list, but  a hostess, manager working the front was so rude that they ignored even yelled to us ""GET OUT"" when we pointed out to them why the group later than us were seated first. This place doesn't seem to have any rule for waiting list. I am not talking about special, excellent customer care for us  from them, considering their location. Instead of kind apologizing,realizing her mistake or trying to make experience better, the dumb manager was extremely rude about this situation, and called security guard  to kick us out. I have never experienced this kind of shit in my life ever!!
     
   Especially  unprofessional manager doesn't seem to know what he's doing for customer care.
  
  Ha Ha!!!  How stupid they are and  treated customer as just trouble makers!!!.  Also, I have never seen any security guard  in this kind of  local  restaurant. I figured out  easily why they hired a big guy like a night club and how many times they kicked even their customers easily.  
  
  Their rules seemed  that Don't ask and don't  argue just follow whatever they do.   If not,  they (security guard) kick out like drunken man at club or casino.

At check out, we got DISRESPECTED by the so called restaurant owner... He refused to help us figure out our bill as it was being split into two orders. We asked if we could barrow their calculator and he says we have to use our own and figure it ourselves and then he answers the phone and completely ignores us.

I have been here numerous times but don't really appreciate the standard customer service given at this place. This place I normally don't refer to friends but I decided to give this place one more shot due to my close friends wanting to eat this last night. Last night was the final draw for this place never have I ever felt violated, disrespected, and degraded in my life. We go here about 2:30 am after a night of long work and studying. It took the waiter 40 mins to take our order. We didn't get our compliment water, napkins, and utensils till all orders arrived. Numerous times have we tried to call a waiter over and cater to us all we got was stares and shut downs. They ignored for about 5 times, as they walked over and looked at us. As we finished up and was ready to pay, we waited at the cashier table for about 20 mins. The so called manager/owner comes through a young skinny Asian boy. He tell him that we are going to split the check into two my friend will pay first and I'll pay second. We have a group of four people and two people on one check the other two on the next check. He tells us we have to figure it our ourselves. We ask for a calculator right in front of him he tells us no you figure it our yourselves. The phones rings as we were try to talk to him he ignores is the whole time. At this point I  furious poor service, and now dealing with an ass of an owner. He tells me to ""shut the fuck up"" ""stop giving him attitude"" he also calls me a ""bitch"". At this point I'm ready to knock his ass out but I have to keep it collective, no one ever talks to me this way I was raised to knock bitches out if I was dissected especially in the way he treated me last night. I tell him ""bitch"" you do not know me don't you ever talk to me in that tone ever again. He then tells me to ""fuck off"" I don't care. I pay give no tip. As we were leaving he then runs outside trying to find security to kick me and my friends out saying we were trespassing when clearly I have to stay to pay the bill unless you want me to have a free meal. I leave he then tells me to ""get the fuck out"". I don't know about you but customer service and being a manager yourself customers are always right and never have I ever in my 25 years of living experience a manager/ owner swear at me.

The next day I come to pick up my stroller they said that someone has already came in to pick it up and that it's not there fault the stroller was left there and it was out of there hands. The manager Ken was very rude and said sorry but there's nothing he can or will do about it.

What was lacking was the size and the composition of goodies that come with a combo. I had zero tripe, very little brisket, and very little else. The spring roll we ordered was also a bit pricey at 6 dollars for 2.

Sure, Pho is the best hangover food you can get, but personally think they're a bit on the pricey side, and their broth isn't that special. They do offer a lot more different kinds of food other than Vietnamese food though.

However, their service is HORRIBLE. People always say, oh yeah you shouldn't expect good services from Asian restaurants , or oh yeah the worse the service is, the better the food is! No, just no. We had to ask them so many times for them to bring up waters, they came to us with the wrong food, server was very impatient when we ordered, and when the food came, they just quickly put the food down anywhere on our table, we had to move the food ourselves.

Seating was prompt, order taking was not.
When dude did arrive, he jacked up my order. I selected #28, Hu Tieu (seafood pho); got egg noodles instead of the rice noodles that I requested. Broth was interesting as it had a strong ginger finish but that didn't make it good. The ingredients were WAY over-cooked to the point that I thought the squid were random pieces of wonton that had fallen into the pot, completely devoid of flavour and with a splatty texture. Shrimp were pink and white curly cues pared from superball material and the cheapy sort, very small sans tail. The sliced jalepeños musta been prepped last week as they were brown around the edges and flaccid.

I pile my steaming bowl high with Thai basil, fresh squeezed lime, and only two jalapeño rings (any more and it gets too spicy towards the end).

You can add extra meat or extra noodles for only $1.00, but I can never eat that much. I usually don't finish my broth and then take it to go and boil noodles for a redo the next day! Score. double meals. 

I've tried a lot of the menu and some of my favorites include:

Side note:  After you've inhaled your grub  - you'll notice that there aren't any cabbies waiting outside to take your semi-sober self back to your hotel on the strip, so you'll have to take a chance at hailing one right on Spring Mountain.

Probably because of their high rate of table turns. All in all, great food though... available 24 hours which is a huge plus.
The only reason I only give them 4 stars is because they lack customer service and caring for their patrons. They seem to be so busy, that they just want you to eat and get the hell out. Lol!

The orange chicken looks delicious until you try to eat it. Some of the pieces of chicken had a really consistency. It's hard to describe. I'm scared it wasn't chicken at all. It was like no chicken I've ever had. Maybe it was old or frost bitten. The texture was not chicken. I could not get my around eating it at all. 

Rice. How do you mess up rice?  The white rice was over cooked and somewhat mushy. The brown rice was undercooked and hard.

I ordered the combination pho and it came out very quickly.  In my mind pho is all about the broth. Broth is a make or break thing and a good pho will have those amazing multiple layers of anise, coriander, fish sauce etc. this broth was missing something. Couldn't put my finger on it, but the broth did not have the flavor explosion I am accustomed to in pho. I wasn't bad per se, but I've had waaaay better pho. Bland. 

The service on the other hand was terrible. I almost walked out of the restaurant because the server helped two other tables that came in after me and still had me sit there for 5 minutes after.

It's always busy and there is always a short wait but that means the food is good. I have ordered the crab rangoons, Vietnamese spring rolls, Singapore noodles, lettuce wraps, and the rare steak pho. Everything here is so good and made to order so it is hot and fresh.

I dont even want to give one star. My bf n I always give more than 18% tip however not today. 
I always order number 13 which is combination pho. there were no meats today. I wanted to say something but I was so upset already I did not want to say another word. 
I know this place is always crowded so the service isnt so good but i ate around 3pm. Also it never wasn't that bad. Today was the WROST EVER!! i'll go to other places",1
142955,cWZKFOk6wFXE_-5cmVu6cQ,FV16IeXJp2W6pnghTz2FAw,"Overall:
Been here twice and of the 1001 pho places in Vegas, this one inches higher than the rest, but still isn't perfect.

Food: I typically order pho with brisket, flank and tendon. Tendon is hit or miss in most Vietnamese places. Both times i've been here i've had issue with it, the first time i got one small piece and this last time i got several inedible hard chunks. The broth is quite good though. I also get a Vietnamese iced coffee. I am used to it coming in the drip brewer at the table and pouring it myself, its kinda fun, but here they brew it in the servers station and deliver it in a styrofoam cup. not a deal breaker, but i like doing it myself.

Service: Good. There is usually a wait to get in because of the popularity but there is ample serving staff and i never feel like i'm invisible or ignored. English is a second language for most of the staff so communication barriers exist but can be overcome with patience.

Atmosphere: nice place, nothing major to note.",4

This place is busy! Noticed that patrons tend to be either party-goers or families. Food is ok, not fantastic. I got the rice noodle with barbecued pork and egg rolls while my bf got his usual chicken pho. Didn't think too highly of the food, but when you are starving, it actually left me pretty satisfied. I can see myself coming here before going out for a party or after a clubbing night. 

One of those places to go to if you are looking for comfort food.",3
142957,JDKenwxWk_XQd9vi-R7t4w,FV16IeXJp2W6pnghTz2FAw,"Wow, 24 hours of Pho that actually tastes delicious? You have GOT to be kidding me.

We flew into Vegas and got situated in our home base (Treasure Island) at around 11pm. We got to Pho Kim Long, and giggled like idiotic teenage boys, at around midnight. The place was slammed. Super busy. We were seated immediately, and the hostess was incredibly friendly. We call this ""Las Vegas"" friendly. Like they're so used to tourists, it's just second nature to make the assumption that we're not from the area and treat us kindly so as not to destroy our vacation. There's a lot of this over there, and for that we're super grateful, being earthy, awkward Portlandians. 

We ordered our drinks (I just had water, my partner ordered a beer) and before my partner's beer even had the chance to arrive we were served our starter (the salad rolls), followed quickly by the two delicious orders of Pho. Their peanut sauce was splendid, and the pho makes this my second favorite of all pho places I've been to, ESPECIALLY at midnight! The beer, unfortunately, came toward the end of dinner which is a no-no as far as my partner is concerned. Given the volume of customers that night, and the wonderful food and friendly, quick service, it was forgivable enough for us to come back and order take away to take back to our room a couple nights later when we were actually craving that delicious soup! We cannot wait to order from them again, in house or take away, either way the food is just as wonderful!",4
142958,sZtbETAPTQw9os3DSwhLOw,FV16IeXJp2W6pnghTz2FAw,"Went based on reviews here and the reviews def were right.
The place is very good. Nicer and more formal than most Pho places.  The vietnamese coffee was good but was shocked they go ahead and do it for you and put it in a to go cup.  Kind of killed the usual experience.  

The salt and pepper calamari was great. The meatball pho was excellent and the broth was light and not oily. Lots of selection!!  Look at the whole menu before you order.  No tripe though ... which I was very shocked by,",4

I started ordering the vegan Pho and love that choice better. I don't prefer to eat meat so I like that option. I'm allergic to shrimp but still choose to eat their shrimp spring rolls because they're THAT delicious. The pricing is not bad at all and the service is good. Although it's always busy, the wait is never really outrageous. We go every Sunday as our family brunch and it never fails. Try it. ;)",5

My boyfriend always gets #14 with the rare steak and I get #20, the plain pho and add fried tofu.  As for meat, I highly recommend #37 or #38 (depending on whether you like beef or steak).  This meat has an amazing flamed grilled flavor.",5
142962,KzlYthYrBa-ZVylgc8oSJA,FV16IeXJp2W6pnghTz2FAw,This place was fun from start to finish.  It's 3am and the place is packed that's a good sign.  I have to wait for a table only 10 mins or so but the hostess was playful and funny so the time flew by.  Once seated the waitress was at the table and taking drink orders within a min of being seated.  There are a lot of choices on the menu.  The food was yummy and I will be back for sure.  All in all this was a nice change of pace for me and the total experience was fun and friendly.,4

And when I do crave for pho I am extremely picky since most places put way too much MSG. I am not a fan of pho kim long in the bay and I am still not a fan of it in Vegas. The broth to me is very medicore with too much MSG. Meh. We didn't have a chance to look around to see if there are other pho restaurants in the area since we wanted something to eat and then head back to the hotel to catch some ZZZzz.",3
142966,UHWs8zywgu9HkfgFPUVYww,FV16IeXJp2W6pnghTz2FAw,"I think that every time I come to vegas I hit up this Pho joint. I love this place because after a night of getting crazy in the clubs I wake up to find photos of us eating here. Lol The times that I have come here and been sober I've loved the pho. Also we never have to wait longer than 7 min for a table, even when it's 3 am and the place is crawling with drunkards. 

The serving size is good for the price you are paying. I usually get the Pho with beef balls and rare steak (in the soup). Most of the time the servers are quick to get our orders in and we usually get our drinks refilled in a timely manner. 

Love this place!",4
142967,rWCNt8pKAF-DrnxlOzt9Ew,FV16IeXJp2W6pnghTz2FAw,"In our 5 days in Vegas we cabbed out to Chinatown 3 times to eat here....

We are pretty lucky here in Vancouver to have access to an abundance of Vietnamese restaurants but I was excited to find something in Vegas with the same quality and taste as the restaurants back home.

It is open 24 hours so one of my visits was after the club - it was busy but we didn't have to wait.
On another night that we went to eat here there was a 20 minute wait but that was around dinner time so that should be expected.

I had the grilled chicken on rice (loved it!) the chicken was tender and moist and it even had the criss-cross grill marks on it.
On another night I had the beef pho and it was delicious. As with all food in the US it felt a little heavy on the sodium but it wasn't bad like the places that put tons of MSG in their soups for flavour meanwhile inducing days of thirst after consumption.
On the night that we went after the club I had the chicken fried rice and it was really good. Huge portions so we even took the rest to go.

The location is really convenient because it's on the outside of the plaza facing Spring Mountain Road.",4
142968,rQyobEV4-RVDyhB9RmfwQg,FV16IeXJp2W6pnghTz2FAw,It is a good Vietnamese restaurant.  Can get very busy but almost all the time it is reliable for those seeking a taste of pho.  It is open 24 Hours so I am amazed at how consistent it is.  The name is quite funny.,4
142969,vZP1Aoeqv8jZl6GCACzPWw,FV16IeXJp2W6pnghTz2FAw,"If someone says this is the best place for pho, you must be on drugs. First, the employees are douche bags. They didn't understand a word I said and gave me the wrong type of pho. And the thing that pissed me off the most is that the cashier expects you to know how much your meal was. If you go up and tell them you don't know, they stand there and tell you to calculate it. And in the customer point of view, THAT IS THE EMPLOYEE'S JOB. Then they just throw out a random number if you don't know what it is. 

Second, the soup to noodle ratio is inefficient. They provide more soup and less noodles. I'd rather pay for more noodles, I mean that's what pho is right, A NOODLE SOUP. I want to get my money's worth. Also, they aren't careful with how they handle their bowls. Since their is too much soup, it spills over the edge. And they don't even clean it up for you. I also tried my cousin's boba, and it was garbage.

Overall. This was enough to influence my decision that I'm never going here again. The employees need to learn how to do their jobs and learn to have better customer service skills. I do not recommend Pho Kim Long for pho lovers.",1

Why is that?

Convenience? Check
Asian food? Check
Good Asian food? Check
24-hour good Asian food? DING WE HAVE A WINNER!

That's right folks. 24 hours of Vietnamese goodness. What better way to ease that hang over or cure that headache with a hearty bowl of food and a side of crispy spring rolls. 

I usually order my Pho Tai (rare beef Pho) or the beef or pork vermicelli/rice plates.

Reasonable prices paired with good and quick service, you've had me at Pho!

Lots of parking in the plaza lot, just make sure you drive into the correct one. Everything starts blending together if you are still feeling the night before.",4

I recently came here for a quick lunch on what I thought would be a quiet Tuesday afternoon.  I arrived at 2pm and it was jam packed!  They have won some ""best of"" awards and that has really helped their business.  But with popularity comes the price increases!! Hey, it's a business and they want to make money so I get it.  

They updated their menu with pricing and graphics, but the dining room is still the same.  

What I like about this place is that they don't mess around.  You definitely don't come here for the customer service, because at Pho Kim Long customer service is non-existent. You come here for the delicious Pho.  I always get the plain noodle Pho.  For $6, you can't beat the price.  Sodas are $3 though.... Kinda high.  

They are very fast and efficient and always refill your water without you having to hunt down a waitress.  Food comes out when it comes out, so don't expect them to course it out for you.

SIDEBAR.....Their egg rolls are also one of my favorite things to get.

The broth was overly salty and for the price you're paying you're not getting a big bowl of pho.  Quantity is not just what I'm looking for, but you have to make up somewhere when quality is lacking.  Even in a Pho Dac Biet there was no tripe to be found.  How can that be?!  It's a staple.

Upon entering, it's in a regular old strip mall. There's enough parking fronting the restaurant. I didn't have many high expectations of this place. The seating reminded me of a traditional Chinese restaurant with round tables, rather than a Vietnamese restaurant.

Service was ok, but not overly friendly. I got the shrimp banh xeo for the appetizer, which is a shrimp fried pancake with mint, lettuce and other conidments to wrap it in. Delicious, crispy but not too oily.

I ordered the pho tai nam. I love their broth. Very rich, piping hot and tasty. Noodles were cooked well and not too hard or soggy. Plenty of condiments from the sweet basil, beans sprouts, garlic chili oil sauce, etc.  I would say the best broths I've tasted ever. Beats any broth in Hawaii hands down. 

I loved the food. Food came out fast. Service wasn't that friendly, but hey, if you are efficient and fast, I'm okay with that. Love that it's 24 hours and wished we had something like this in Hawaii.",5

Also voted #1 pho in Las Vegas. So, we took our chance and waited for almost an hour. I'm only reviewing their pho. It was nothing spectacular. On a Sunday afternoon after a night of partying on the strip, their pho did it's job. One of my biggest pet peeves is when lemon wedged are served on the side with pho. Who does that?! No doubt, it should always always always be lime wedges!! Service was good. The other menu items looked good at the table next to us. However, we only had their pho. Make sure to stop by Lee's Sandwiches for the best Bahn Mi. It's only a few doors down in the same mall area.",3

Quic Tip: If it's packed, and you don't want to wait for a table, you can order your food to go, it's faster! Also you can even call ahead and they can have your order ready for you by the time you get there. Oh and if you are planning to go there on Sunday for dinner, be prepared to wait!  I always recommend this place to out of town friends who are looking for after hours grub, especially after drinking... and they never fail to impress. I think that they are a little bit pricey for a vietnamese restaurant, and the customer service could be a bit better on some days, especially when packed... but overall, i still like going here. My fave dishes are the grilled pork chop, salted fish fried rice, calamari and wonton noodle soup.",4

Went to get iced coffee from the Lee's Sandwiches next door, picked up some bread from a nearby bakery, and then we were called to sit down. To my surprise, the wait was only around 20 minutes.

After placing our order, the drinks and food came out almost instantly; as in, everything we ordered was on the table within 5 minutes. I have never had my food come out that fast, but the hangry beast inside of me did not have time to question why or to be skeptical. 

I ordered Pho Tai and egg rolls. They both were delicious and quite satisfying. After adding lemon to my Pho Tai, the broth was flavored perfectly to my liking.

The prices are reasonable, the service is lacking but adequate - what you would expect from a very crowded Pho place, but the food comes out quickly and tastes great. I will be back if I ever am in Vegas and in dire need of a good Pho restaurant.",4

I can't really say for the other things and I'm not sure if it's because of a long night out, but I'm venturing to say this is one of my favorite pho restaurants I've been to.

Lettuce wraps were mediocre. Beef Pho was excellent. Broth was amazing. Add a few jalapeños for spice. A lot of food. You don't need an appetizer.,4
143023,zG8NBg5UMQRCedfpgt1hkg,FV16IeXJp2W6pnghTz2FAw,"Unbelievable. This place is a joke! The employees and manager are beyond ridiculous. 

Here is the story. My mother and I had gone right now and had ordered some food and one of the many foods we ordered was Chicken Pad Thai. When our dish came out and we ate couple chopstick full & looked at this so called ""chicken"" that was thinly sliced, chewy and what seemed and look like fat attached was simply ""pork"". 

Like any customers would, we called over our waiter, he took it back unsure as well than ANOTHER waiter aggressively came back with the dish and claimed it was chicken. We argued about this for several mins & because we didn't want to make a bigger scene we told him to take the dish back. 

NOW, this next part gets better. As we continue to eat our rest of the food, the waiter and his other employees gather around near by we were sitting and have the nerves to talk about our situation and laugh about it. So, as a customer I was furious. Asked for the manager to let him be aware of his employees behavior. Of course -_- manager isn't any better with his behavior so possibly that's why his employees aren't any better either -_- so anyways, manager comes to our table, not making any eye contact with me and fights for his employees (which is understandable defending his employees). Finally got an apology and ended the conversation. 

This gets even better, once the check arrives, we were charged for Chicken Pad Thai (in most case in other restaurants, the dish is taken off the check) so we only paid for what we only ate and with that kind of a crappy service, we didn't leave tip. As we were leaving, the manager came out to our car and told us we didn't pay enough. This is how the conversation went:

Manager: ""you didn't pay enough!""
Me: ""no, we paid for what we ate.""
Manager: ""shut up!""

So at this point, I was beyond furious and got out of our car and went up to him and he had the nerve to say he didn't tell me to shut up. So now I'm apparently gone crazy and hearing things -_- then he aggressively argues with me that I didn't pay enough, so I had to RE-EXPLAIN to him that we ONLY paid for what we actually ate and not what was taken back (since we didn't eat it!). 

This is where he failed miserably as a manager...not only did he verbally fight back, tell me to shut up, but he had his biggest nerves to tell me my service was unwanted there and for me to ""go to hell"". 

Uhm, are you serious right now?! How in the world can a restaurant manager say all that to a customer?????!!!!!! My mind was so blown away. Un-freaking-believe-able! For sure NEVER going back there and it is such a disappointment cause I been going there for many years now. I seriously think they are so full of it!     

This doesn't even deserve a (1) star but I have to give something to leave a review...FML -_-",1

143028,ustXCvVqpLUT2Hb9MPlEFg,FV16IeXJp2W6pnghTz2FAw,"My stomach hurts so bad as I write this review, I am definitely torching this place. 

This place is terrible! My whole family got sick after eating here. As I lay here feeling full of regret and in disbelief of how disgusting our dinner was here, my stomach is extra tender and sore and my mouth is numb and dehydrated. 

I'm full Vietnamese and this place is such a huge embarrassment and a disgrace to real authentic Vietnamese food. 

First offense - the goi cuon (shrimp and pork spring rolls/ summer rolls) were tiny and barely had any filling inside. A piece of lettuce, a tiny bit of noodles, a sliver of meat and 3 slivers of shrimp. Oh, and that so called dipping sauce was so gross! Super watered down. What a ripoff. 

Second offense - Msg was never really an issue for me and it never really caused me any problems, until I ate here. Also, my uncle is really sensitive to it and he had a lot of issues with his pho. He didn't drink any of his pho broth because it had too much MSG and by the end of dinner he started to feel sick. 

Third offense - the nuoc cham (fish sauce/dipping sauce) was so watered down, that I ended up asking them for 3 bowls for my meal - but even 3 bowls was not enough and I finally gave up. It was disgustingly bland. I was pretty much pouring sugar water onto my rice. 

Fourth offense - my pork chop was dry and the marinade was bland. The charring on the pork chop tasted artificial. 

Fifth offense - our tongue is all sorts of numb and shriveled up after eating here. I guess MSG does that to you. We're extremely weak, thirsty and dehydrated now. 

Sixth offense - the chow fun beef noodles in gravy (hu tieu xao bo) was so unappetizing and unappealing, I was in disbelief they served it to us. They overcooked the chow fun noodles so they broke up into a billion of small pieces when you tried to pick them up with chopsticks, the gravy was all watery and goopy. It was not tasty at all. 

With so many options in Vegas to get Vietnamese food late, this place is not one of them.",1

143030,RGPhpSSnrfOcKhq-VlG41A,FV16IeXJp2W6pnghTz2FAw,Good for a morning hangover. Good portions for a decent price. This place gets busy at night and in the morning on the weekends.  Thai Tea was disappointing though.  Lots of meat in the pho.,4

143032,blYWIEBQA0zagFTDQYrivA,FV16IeXJp2W6pnghTz2FAw,"Definitely not the top choice for pho during a Vegas getaway trip. I decided to try it out after hearing that it was pretty decent. WRONG. Right when we were seated, we were asked what we wanted to order FOUR TIMES within a 10 minute time period. Barely having any time to think, the manager asks after his second time, ""Ready to order? There are people waiting to eat so you guys should hurry and make a selection"". (He said something rude along the lines of that). They are basically just trying to get people in, take the money, and kick them out. This is definitely the worst customer service I've ever had in a restaurant. 

I ordered a #13 combination pho (the combo wasn't really a combo considering there was barely much variety in there)
My friend ordered the steak rice plate, which looked slapped on without nice plating presentation. It was not worth the amount paid for the quality. 

I don't think I've ever had such a poor experience at a Vietnamese Restaurant. I see some previous complaints about the manager below and it is certain that he hasn't changed at all. What a dick. Please take this evaluation into consideration before going here to eat.",2

143040,CNkHSloGyP5oqGXk-FQXYQ,FV16IeXJp2W6pnghTz2FAw,"I would of gave this place either 4-5 stars if it wasn't for the mute, slow service. I must admit though, their interior design makes this pho restaurant upscale than others. I've been to a good amount of pho restaurants here in Las Vegas and if you have too then you know that pho & drinks are served to you pretty fast.

Now before I go on to my little rant, I must add that their pho is never a disappointment. What I always get is number 13 which is the combination pho which has a little bit of most things & the steak is flavorful. So good job Pho Kim Long for yummy pho ! But BOO for the lack of service you offer ! 

My boyfriend and I went and we ordered two #13 combination phos and I also ordered a tai tea boba. About 3 minutes later our pho is served to us but not my drink. You would of thought my drink came first, right? Well, I thought, ""Oh, maybe they're still making it"" so about another good 5 minutes passes by & my boba is still not served to me & I started to question my thoughts about this place. So we asked one of the waiters where my boba was and he just walked off without any acknowledgement or reassurance that it was coming. So we waited another 10 minutes and my boyfriend and I are just about done with our pho and still....no....tai tea boba. I asked another waiter, ""Hi excuse me, I've been waiting for about 10 minutes for my tai tea boba now and I still haven't gotten it."" & he got the job done but he didn't even apologize for the long wait. 

I got my boba just in time we paid for the check and the boba was great but ugh the service is whack. I need I add that we did go there during graveyard hours but still, you can't lack on a job especially if it runs 24/7 and stays busy.",3

What ruins this is the service. There was absolutely no attention paid to us. Over half the time I was there I had no water. I tried getting the attention of three different workers and was ignored. When two busboys were bussing the table besides us I asked one of them if we could have more water. He barely looked at me and said hold on with his index finger up. That whole time afterwards I was watching him and there were times he had nothing to do and still didn't refill our drinks. Even after making eye contact with him multiple times he still didn't come.

143054,91imM6uo1vLoG61n4e9ljg,FV16IeXJp2W6pnghTz2FAw,"I have dined her 2 times. I always give most restaurants a few chances. The first time My experience was good. I enjoyed the Pho very much as well as the spring rolls. 
BUT today I was highly disappointed. I ordered the Wor Won ton soup and it was lacking a whole lot. No flavor to my broth what so ever. The pork egg rolls were warm, not hot. seemed like they were sitting for a bit before being served to our table. 

On a good note we were seated immediately upon arrival during the Lunch Rush Hour. Our waitress was fast, and friendly, She even fixed our bill for us as there was an error and we were charged for something we did not order. 
The Pho my brother Ordered was full of flavor. 

My suggestion is DO NOT ORDER the wor won ton soup. Stick with the PHO!",2
143055,Jqv_mhh0JPRMnaikinGehA,FV16IeXJp2W6pnghTz2FAw,"I used to hate this place. I can't get myself to eat pho at a Restaurant when we make it at home.

The first time I went the service was so horrible that I do to even remember the food.

Today I went for lunch with my friends and reluctantly got #13.. It was really good today. The serving was generous and it came out quickly. I know that can be a bad thing but it was a good thing today since we were hungry. The amount of meat for the price was good also. The broth was good and they have us a generous amount of herbs and sprouts.

We got two appetizers the crab rangoons and the egg rolls. They were both good but nothing special.

I took the time out to write this quick review because the service was so good today.

Usually the staff is pretty short and rude.

Today they were attentive, polite, and efficient. We had like 4 people help us.

It seems with the increased business they're getting they took the time to improve the service.

I was just really pleasantly surprised in the best way possible.

I've had their drunken noodles which is a Thai dish that they actually do a really good version of.

They have good food for sure so if you were reluctant to eat here because of bad service I'd say to give them another chance.",4

We arrived a little after 2am on a Wednesday night, there was a line and I didn't mind. I'd have to say that's the only negative thing I encountered.

So for starters I ordered the Fried Potstickers and the Crispy Calamari. The potstickers were just perfect and full of flavor. The calamari I absolutely fell in love with! Fried to a perfect golden brown crisp, on a bed of cabbage and peppers with a cocktail sauce on the side. All the flavors were right and it made me want another order soon as I was done!

For entree I had the Roasted Duck with Peanuts and a sweet and sour sauce. The duck was seasoned and roasted to a tee and the sauce along with the peanuts and cilantro really connected all of the flavors as one. One of the best plates of duck I've had in a while! I wasn't full although I was indeed satisfied. This is a nice place to go after a night of clubbing or even for a date. I will definitely be back again!",5

I was getting my bracelet restrung at the World of Feng Shui during a trip to Vegas and got hungry.  I was by myself and thought, hmmm, let's get some Vietnamese since I'm right in the middle of Chinatown.....?

Long story short.  I waited for 15 minutes.  They forgot to bring my 3 color bean drink (the very first thing I ordered).  The pho was average.  I asked for just tendons in my pho.  I love tendons.  There might have been 3 pieces floating or buried under my noodles.  The eggrolls were greasy and very small.  

Maybe I'm just used to Westminster, CA or Little Saigon as it's known as.  Or maybe I made the mistake of asking my Lebanese taxi driver where to get good Vietnamese.  Or maybe I just should have stuck with Chinese food in Chinatown......",2

Dislikes:
-Not the friendliest service, but frankly, most Asian restaurants, like this aren't.

The wait for 5 the Monday afternoon following EDC weekend was about 20-25 minutes. Not bad considering what a packed weekend it was and the families buzzing around.

Got the Pho Tai Nam with tai on the side. They confused my order. I ordered a small, I got a large. I ordered tai on the side, they gave me tai with an extra order of tai on the side. It's okay, though! It was really THE hangover cure. The broth wasn't too shabby, a bit too much sodium for my taste, but I don't inhale the broth so it was okay.

The smoothies are packed with powders, but still delicious. I'd get the avocado one over the mango one, though. The avocado powder is at least masked by the creaminess of the milk and had a better aftertaste. 

The decor is extremely modern! I was pleasantly surprised. I'm not sure why I was expecting something more rundown with 70s decor, haha. Maybe I'm just used to frequenting those types of joints. Just don't come in here with high hopes of having a deep conversations -- all the sounds are literally bouncing off the walls. I think it's the ""yay I'm cured from my hangover"" happiness that reverberates through the walls, but the yummy soup could also the case :).",3

With my most recent trip to Vegas being a bit longer of a stay.... finally, I had enough time to make it out to this 24/7 pho joint. I'm glad I did!! 
First off, the Crab Rangoon was so good that I ordered a second order... (don't worry, I was sharing haha). So definitely try that!  
For my main dish, I ordered the beef and flank pho... sooooo delicious! I think I'm getting the hang of how to eat pho! I'm still quite the novice pho eater, so I don't have a bunch to compare to... but the pho I had in Hawaii was on par with this establishment. 
To be honest, this place was a lot bigger than I imagined and a lot nicer, too. For a place thats open 24hrs a day, I figured it'd be a little hole in the wall... but there is ample seating and the ambience is surprisingly a slight step above casual.

Took a taxi here, it was about 15$, waited about 20 minutes and was seated right away.  The prices are generally the same.  The interior is awesome very nice inside.  we ordered bahn xeo, 2 bowls of pho, vermicelli, calamari, and spring rolls.

The soup is as close to homemade as you can get at a restaurant (especially in Las Vegas, NV). Small selection of meats, but the meats that they do offer are good. They pile on the meats but don't give you enough noodles. They are generous with the vegetables - I asked for extra basil and limes, and they gladly gave me a small plateful. 

We came late night at around 11pm, and there was a waiting list and full lobby. It took about 20 minutes for my table of 10 to get seated; our order was taken within 5 minutes and came out in the next 10 minutes. The service is fast but not attentive. The environment is loud and somewhat chaotic, well decorated.

This place got the right broth for me. I usually order Pho Dat Biet, the ""combination meat "" and depending on my mood I have a few go to appetizers I like. The SPRING ROLLS are always good, CRAB RANGOONS are also tasty and also I love to get the SHRIMP MAYO w/ WALNUTS. Try those!

THE Service is Teribble and on our third visit and first serious offense the manager was Very Rude and basically told us he did not need us. I was polite and patient the manager defensive and rude.

I got Pho, nowhere can beat it about the bad taste.Broth and meat, both was so bad. My wife ordered a Bun Bo Hue (her favorite at all) then it disapointed her to such an extent that she couldnt finish it. Of course each person has different taste but i dont want to pay that much for the stuffs not worth it (everything there has a higher price than the others).

143086,sKmLJEGTrmP0CGXf8VVmlA,FV16IeXJp2W6pnghTz2FAw,"I always enjoy coming here when I'm in Vegas. Like any of the buffets, this is one of the must stop places.  The food is good and isn't too pricey.  Some of their portions look a lil small when your stomach is growling at you because you've realized just then that man/woman cannot survive on just alcohol and chlorine alone. LOL.  But, it's just enough to satisfy your hunger. I love that this is a 24 hour spot. Too late and you will see some drunks in here acting stupid but nothing over the top to get 'em kicked out. The wait staff are all pretty irritable seeming. LOL. I am not shocked. Their Pho isn't bad but it was a lil too salty for me. My godson, 3 years old, loves their egg rolls and their chow mein. He also likes their grilled pork and chicken. Visits here tend to be with our family who are also out in Vegas, either living there or other family who are just visiting, like us. There can be a wait. So, be prepared for that. And make sure that you give the host your name and that he WRITES IT DOWN on his clip board. Otherwise, you'll be passed up a few times.  I think that was the part that my husband disliked the most.  We'd been standing in the wait area for a while and nobody came to seat us. All of a sudden, 4 punk kids walk in and all of a sudden they are being seated. NOPE. My husband walked past those 4 kids and sat down, knowing that we should be helped first. The kids didn't say anything. They knew that we'd been there before them. The host was confused and my husband had to explain to him what had happened. The host said that he thought that we got there after those kids who he saw just walk in moments before he motioned to them to come and sit.  Anyway, my husband talked to the manager and all was well.  That was just the one time. It hasn't happened ever again since then. 

Food is good. The prices are about right. The pho broth tends to be a lil salty at night. The egg rolls are my godson's fave. They accept cash and card. There is parking all over and it's a 24 hour spot. I don't think you could ask for much more.",3
143087,x_VAG7WppssxLsF4OUwP0g,FV16IeXJp2W6pnghTz2FAw,"I was in town last month for edc.  I'm from NY, so we have some pretty decent pho.  The best is still the one my sister and mom makes.  Every time my bf and I travel to the west coast, I always want to try the pho in town.  Pho Kim Long definitely hit the spot.  I was hesitant at first to pick this spot.  Many of the previous reviews had mentioned about the waiters being rude.  We are from New York, we know what rude is!! We didn't have any problem here.  

Deco:  it was very simple, many big family tables.  My bf and I were seated at a table that fits 6 people.  We had the entire table to ourselves, even though there were people waiting for a seat.  In NY Viet restaurants, they would easy make you share a table with total strangers!  Overall, the restaurants and waiters seems somewhat clean.

Food:  I had the pho with sliced raw beef.  The broth was very tasty.  I very much enjoyed it.  I have to say that it was comparable to the pho in NY.  It tasted just as good but cleaner.  It sounds strange but if had the pho from pho bang in ny, you would know what I mean.  

Service: the waiter was attentive and quick.  I'm there for the food, not to make friends.  I just got out of airport security, 5 hrs flight, 1 hr car rental line, I just want quick good food!  This Viet pho spot definitely satisfied my taste buds and made the trip well worth it.",4
143088,X2eHDIsyPCxN9OhGjGyiWA,FV16IeXJp2W6pnghTz2FAw,"One of my favorite pho joints.

Pho:
The pho here is definitely on point. The broth comes out steaming hot and the broth is seasoned so well. This is one of the places where the broth is so good you'd clean the entire bowl out. It's addicting how good the pho is here. My equally just as good favorite dish to order here is the calamari. It's literally the best calamari I've ever had. They deep fry in a way that isn't super crispy but also is kind of soft in a way. I don't know how they do it but its the perfect deep fried texture. Also, the portion that they give is enormous! It was just two of us and we couldn't kill the entire plate of calamari.

Service:
Service here is okay. They seat you quickly if it's not busy and the food comes out quick. If you get pho, it always comes out before anything else does. The waiters were quick with the refills but if you're there for a while the service get slower and slower. It took us a while for them to realize I was trying to flag them down. Then it took even longer for them to get the check out to us. Service here is my only complaint.

Best part to this restaurant is that it's open 24 hours so you can get your pho craving in anytime.

TLDR; Good Pho and Calamari. Bad service.",4

But nonetheless I've been coming here for years for pho. Though i do recommend you coming here at the end of your day/night. Because you are what you eat..no really... you end up smelling like you took a shower in pho afterwards..  Cologne/perfume won't help...don't even try it...home should be your next destination...don't even stop for gas,4

143091,eDlCRpSUF4ITcacpbfJrmw,FV16IeXJp2W6pnghTz2FAw,"My friends and I came to Pho Kim Long to eat dinner around 8PM. Upon first impressions, I liked the decor of the restaurant. It was nicely decorated and roomy. We were also seated immediately. We all sat down, thought about what we wanted to order... 10 minutes had gone by after we were seated and no one came up to us to ask us what we wanted to drink. A couple of minutes later, an older gentleman took our orders. My friend and I both ordered Pho Dat Biet (special combination tender beef noodle soup, $8.75), my boyfriend ordered half of the Ga Chien Gion (deep fried chicken with fried garlic, $13.95 for half chicken), and my other friend ordered Com Chien Tom (shrimp fried rice, $11.50). 

Here came the most disappointing part. I'm not exaggerating when I say that 30 minutes had literally gone by before the first dish came out, and that was my boyfriend's deep fried chicken dish. I thought that this dish was pretty good. It wasn't too salty and I loved the fried garlic. Do note that this dish didn't come with rice so you would need to order it on the side. At this point, I'm starting to look around the room hoping to catch the attention of the workers to see if they had brought out our dishes. 5 minutes after the fried chicken came out, both of the Pho Dat Biet came out. Honestly, I didn't think that it was too good. The broth wasn't anything spectacular and for the ""special"" bowl of Pho that we ordered, there was barely any beef, tripe, tendon, and all the other components that goes in the special. 

At this point, my other friend who had ordered such a simple dish of fried rice STILL has not received has order. We started trying to track down the employees and finally managed to spoke to one about how we haven't received the last dish of fried rice. There was a couple who was sitting nearby us, who were seated way after we were seated and had managed to receive their food order BEFORE we even got ours! And how is it that the fried rice would be the last dish to come out? Makes no sense to me.... So about 10 minutes after both of the Pho dishes came out, my friend's fried rice finally came out. It didn't look too appealing either... He also mentioned that some of the parts in his fried rice were cold and not warm at all...

I don't know what happened with our order honestly. Pho Kim Long is open 24 hours, which is great for people who want to grab a late meal after EDC, clubbing, etc ;]. Since Vegas is the city that never sleeps, I'm sure many people there appreciate how late Pho Kim Long is opened. It's possible that at night, they don't have as many cooks in the kitchen or they simply forgot our order... who knows! I most likely wouldn't visit Pho Kim Long to eat again unless I desperately needed some soup or Pho late at night!",2
143092,oq-zoO7UhMkecvCYcCzcDw,FV16IeXJp2W6pnghTz2FAw,Benz is the greatest! He remembers exactly what me and my boyfriend order every time I come in after work and pick up food to take home.

143093,tCrlG-hl7wnm5FFmQe35Dg,FV16IeXJp2W6pnghTz2FAw,"Went here last night with a couple of friends for the first time in a while because they were craving pho.  It was a fairly busy early Saturday morning.  We were sat pretty quickly which was nice, happy that they have such a quick turnover for tables.

The food is consistently good every time I come here.  Today the dish I usually order (pork chop w/ baked egg) was extra delicious!  They had a special salt & pepper eggplant that was pretty good as well.

The only reason I took away a star was because they forgot my drink order and when I asked for utensils they also forgot to bring some by.  They didn't check on us after all the food was dropped off and we had to go to the counter to get our check.

But all in all, still a great late night place to get your Asian food fix after a night out of clubbing or work!",4
143094,YUuN2bCYgw8DIngatg4vHg,FV16IeXJp2W6pnghTz2FAw,LOVE. I come to vegas basically just to get their chicken wings and bun. My favorite Vietnamese restaurant ever.,5
143095,4rziW9Mr1AIfmCLWj6RsnQ,FV16IeXJp2W6pnghTz2FAw,It was pretty packed but our party of 3 none the less was seated within five minutes. The servers definitely pay attention and were at our table to take our order the second the last menu was set on the table. Brown rice as an option is great for us semi-conscious eaters lol,4
143096,G90ekPjqEhxRX1b8G8AJLA,FV16IeXJp2W6pnghTz2FAw,"WORSE MANAGEMENT EVER. I came back to this place a year later with my whole family because i enjoyed it the last time we went and the prices were reasonable. My family ordered food that is SUPPOSE to come with rice. The server never told us that a cup of rice would be charged on each person. Who would think rice, so simple and given, would cost so much. When we found out that they charge $15 extra on our bill when it was ALREADY expensive, we questioned the manager about it and they argued with us and told one of the employees to take all the rice, THAT WE WERE EATING, away from us. What happened to customer service and how the customer is always right? What are they going to to do with the used rice? Hopefully throwing it away. But who knows, with their greediness and disrespect to the customers, they must use the used rice to make the fried rice.",1
143097,jdwjRv9nepqOs0TBJ70lzw,FV16IeXJp2W6pnghTz2FAw,"This is my favorite late night place after a night of drinking, and for takeout when I'm sick. The pho is great and the ingredients and everything are really fresh, i love the veggie pho and it is full of fresh veggies. I like their bob a teas as well, its always open and always really fast. The service is not the friendliest, but they are probably dealing with a ton of drunks like my friends and I so I'm not too picky.",4
143098,XkgdiKogZ9hW7fGemU_GHg,FV16IeXJp2W6pnghTz2FAw,"DO NOT GO HERE!!! I don't usually write bad reviews but place this deserves ZERO stars. They increased and over charged everything on the menu. While eating we were already disappointed how terrible the food was compared to before. 

When the bill came out, we realized they ripped us off. We ordered tons of food, they brought out white rice and charged us $15. First of all, a bag of rice is $25 that will last you for a year. They freaking charge you $1.50 per small bowl...WTF??? We didn't even ask for rice and they brought it out for no reason and refused to refund us the money until we argued with them.

I would never come back and I would not recommend this place to anyone. There are tons of restaurants around, there is no reason to come here. 

Steam chicken $26
Ca Kho To $18.90
Canh Chua $18.90
Coconut (not fresh) $5.50
Fried Tofu (4 )  $10
Rice - $15 for a bucket 

Vietnames food should not be this expensive. This place is NOT an upscale restaurant. I rather spend this amount at a Thai, Japanese,  or other upscale restaurants. Coconut is usually $2.50, Ca Kho To is usually under $10. If the food was superb, I don't mind paying for it but it wasnt.",1
143099,Hiss99gn1Ac-3wiFQtr9fw,FV16IeXJp2W6pnghTz2FAw,"Recommended to me by 2 different Vietnamese friends. I love the Pho and egg drop wonton soup here. Egg rolls were great too. The place is always busy which is a good sign and its open 24hrs which is awesome. For 2 people the bill was only like $35 and we were full with 2 large Pho, 2 coconuts/water, and egg rolls. I will definitely be back.",5

After indulging yourself for days in The Entertainment Capital of the World, give your kidney  and wallet a rest and come here for some cheap good eats.  I like their egg roll bun with a side of spring rolls.  Nothing like a light vermicelli dish with all my favorite vegetables and some fried fatty egg rolls to soak up all the boozing and food from Sin City.  The prices are reasonable and service is fast.  I don't normally want something hot for the car ride home since it makes me sleepy so bun is the way to go for me.  Maybe one day I'll try their pho.

Anyways, Pho Kim Long is 24/7 so it's a perfect for all the clubrats and the hungover boozers.  Chances are, if it's after midnight and you're there, you're probably a clubrat or a barfly yourself.  We're all just one big family here.",4

I was starving and wanted a quick breakfast that was on the way home because I was really wanting to finally get some sleep. It was 7 am and this seemed to be the only place open in Chinatown so it was my perfect opportunity to finally try it.

I was craving pho the last couple weeks which naturally guided me to select from the pho section of their extensive menu. I went with a #13 which was a beef combination pho and included meatballs, tendon, rare beef and brisket. The broth and noodles were right on point with its flavor and wasn't too bland or strong like at some other spots. The meats were good, except for the meatballs which had a weird taste to it. 

This is a fairly large restaurant and probably the biggest pho place I've seen. Do people have parties here like they do at Chinese restaurants? Let's have a pho-king party! Being 24/7 definitely is also a plus and I'll have to keep this place in mind for late night or early morning outings.",4

I found a SCRAP/CANNED piece of METAL inside my boba smoothie ! This is so disappointing & especially for one of the top known Vietnamese restaurants in Vegas. I took my smoothie home because I've gotten full from their food but as I started drinking my smoothie... I don't know if the little piece of ""sharp"" metal was in my actually drink or in the boba balls but regardless it SHOULDN'T had even been in the drink !!! Huge warning/red flag!!! It's sad..

Yes, the hype on this place is a little over-the-top but I can understand, their pho broth is #1 and Pho Saigon 8 is #2 to my taste buds! Can't beat them, they're just too delicious. I've been their customer for about six and a half years now and probably visited this restaurant more than 80 times. Highly recommend their springs rolls (which is a bit over-priced but it's tasty so it's worth the extra few dollars $$), their fried egg rolls, lettuce wraps, and combination pho! They have other selections that aren't just Vietnamese cuisine but that of Chinese, Thai, Korean, and Japanese (very little but still present).

Their prices have increased over the years but their taste still gives them the huge reputation they have. Sometimes my visits vary a bit with them when it comes to their service; either they're really awesome and friendly OR they're lifeless and non-attentive. Asides that, I suggest you give this place a visit so you can decide whether or not Pho Kim Long lives up to their name.",4

I had a small pho tai and my girlfriend got a small pho tom (shrimp.) 
The broth was watered down and tasted nasty. The portion for a small $9 bowl is ridiculous. I had literally 3 pieces of steak. The shrimp was undercooked. 
Barely any noodles. They don't even have black pepper at the tables. What kind of ""Vietnamese Cuisine"" is this? I understand it is also Chinese but the menu is in Viet with English in small font, so why is the pho phoking disgusting? 
I am Vietnamese and take pride in my culture and especially the food. 
I would never recommend this to anyone and I will never step foot in here again. 
Truly disgusted. Waste of time. Pho jenny down the street for late night pho even beats this place. Yuck!

This use to be the spot where we'd invite family and friends to eat whenever we're all in town at the same time. 

The food here is no longer good. I think due to the 24/7 hours, they've changed the way they make their food and it's no good. 

The pho isn't good at all. The soup doesn't have the beef flavor in it at all, it just doesn't taste how pho should taste. 

The service here sucks. You're already waiting in a long ass line just to finally get in and wait some more. Once you're seated, the waiter/waitress will just give you your menus and leave...not even dropping off water. Sometimes it'll take almost 30mins until they comeback to take the order. 

The last two times I went were not good at all. 

I went with my friend and we were seated in a corner and completely forgotten about. 

Another time, I went with my parents and sister. My sister ordered the chow fun and the waiter messed up our chow fun order with another. When we told him the order was wrong, he got the chow fun from the other table and gave it to us to eat...the other table had already eaten out of it...

But if I don't share this experience, I'm not being true to my Yelp self or my fellow Yelpers out there. Every restaurant has a bad night and I have been going to Pho Kim Long since before moving to Las Vegas. The service is efficient and the food always delivers, whether you are there at 7pm or 4 in the morning. But recently I had an experience that has put me off of my beloved go-to spot possibly forever. 

It all started on a busy Friday night around 3am. I had a craving for some Pho after work. We had to wait about 15 minutes for a table because they were jam packed, slammed, crazy busy. No problem. I get it. Not the end of the world. 
However, once we were finally sat all the way in the back in a corner, nobody came to take our order. There were servers, bussers and runners all scurrying around us too busy to even take a beverage order. The first 10 or so minutes I can forgive but when I actively am trying to flag someone down and literally every employee refuses to make eye contact, even I start to get frustrated. We became the table that time forgot. 

15 minutes...20 minutes go by.
25 minutes in and we still don't even have a glass of water. We have now been at Pho Kim Long for a total of 40 minutes with nothing to show for it. But I refuse to be that person who makes a scene and leaves, so I wait it out. 
I FINALLY flag down the guy bussing the table next to ours and he brings us some waters and promises to send the server over. She comes over looking rather (understandably) bedraggled and we very politely put in our order after explaining our situation. She offers no apology and acts as if it's not a big deal. So I'm a little peeved at the lack of reaction. But my pho is on the way and my stomach is growling. 
My beautiful bowl of soup is placed before me and I turn my attention away from the negative experience and grab my chopsticks. And then I see it...gently floating amongst my rice noodles, swimming in my delicious broth without a care in the world is...a...
COCKROACH. 

I stand up, push my bowl away and just point in astonishment and horror. My confused dinner companion sees what I am pointing at and flags down the nearest employee who proceeds to whisk the dish away before I have a chance to gather my wits and take a picture. So now we are both standing at the table trying to figure out what to do. NOBODY comes back over to inquire about us or make amends. So we look at each other, nod and start walking towards the front door. On the way I find our server and take her aside to calmly explain the entire situation and inform her that we are leaving. And I again get a complete non reaction. No apology, no manager. Just an ok and a bewildered stare.

I'm done.",1

Food was also really good and hit the spot. Although food was good, I think the customer service needs a lot of work and in having the same server too. I would definitely add more stars if the customer service improved, to be honest.
The first time for dine-in, I swear we had 3 different servers come to us and then when we asked about a boba drink to one of the workers there, they looked so lost and confused like they didn't know what boba was and was surprised that it was on their menu. So on and so forth, we got what we wanted.
The second time for pick-up was alright. The host was chill. Food took a while, but then again, it's usually always so busy there because it's a 24-hour place.

The host barely even noticed me. He didn't notice me until I asked him for an order to-go... Anyhow, I barely even got to look at the menu he handed me and he already asked me what I wanted, so I just basically ordered what I ordered last time which was chicken chow fun for me and orange chicken with a side of rice for my boyfriend... It took a while, but it was fine, whatever, because it's busy. I went back to the front to wait for my food and like 10 minutes later, the same host who helped me asked me if I had been helped... -_- Anyways, I paid right when the host gave me the receipt, but when my food came out, he brought me back to the cash register and tried to have me pay again. Luckily one of the workers there saw that I paid and said that it was okay.
I finally took the food home and what do you know?! There is HAIR in the orange chicken... Long black hair. Not just one, but two strands... And maybe more. But I just threw the food away...

The pho and other traditional Vietnamese food is great, but surprisingly their Orange Chicken is also fantastic. I know, I know.

143147,nRLRFcVJgAhwLnlJYvZ2iQ,FV16IeXJp2W6pnghTz2FAw,"This place gets a lot of hype. It's good. But I wasn't overwhelmed.

Pho is solid - can't go wrong with any of the choices.
I also tried the clams in black bean sauce (good), fried mussels (ok) and mayonnaise shrimp with walnuts (good).

They asked if we wanted rice, we said yes. Was charged $3. Wish they said something before we saw it on the check. Plus, most places give you white rice for free if you order mains (I can understand if we just ordered pho).  3 mains (in addition to a pho per person) and I'm charged for rice? I'm big on principle.

It's a good deal compared to 99% of restaurants on the strip (for those visiting) but by the time you add in cab fare round trip, it loses some of its value.

But if you're craving pho after a long night of partying - can't go wrong.

We ask for them but the guy/owner didn't even acknowledge me while I am looking at him for about a minute then he asked what do I need. I thought that was insulting. One of the friends ask for some condense milk. The response of the waiter was what do you need it for. That was unnecessary. Because it is open early we like to start our day early. We like to enjoy our precious day here in NV. Thanks Pho Kim Long for ruin our day. Just a friendly reminder for who is looking an enjoyable vacation please avoid this place at all cost.

My favorite is their Rare Steak and Brisket soup. The broth is full of flavor. I've tried a lot of different places around Las Vegas but no one has broth like they serve here. 
I also like ordering their spring rolls. It comes with sides of bean sprouts, mint leaves and lime and you wrap it with lettuce leaves. Yummy! 
On our latest visit, we ordered the Japanese noodles. We keep forgetting to order it every-time we come here and finally this time we remembered it before we were already full. It was really scrumptious. No wonder why almost every table we saw had ordered this as well. 
The fish stew was also delightful. The fish was tender and not overcooked. It was sautéed with ginger, which gave it a clean flavor. It was so good, I was conflicted whether I wanted to make more room for that or the rare steak pho that I usually order. I ended up eating the former and took the rest of the latter home. 
As for my 4 star rating, as good as their food is, I take away a star bec of their service. The staff isn't very friendly and most of the time, their service is lousy.

I ordered my usual pho dac biet.  The prices were slightly higher than what I was used to in San Francisco, but it was well worth it. I'm not sure if it was because I was hungover or because I hadn't had pho in a long time, but I thought the broth was fantastic!  Everything else in the bowl was standard.

After a long night out, my cousins and I woke up Saturday morning wanting something to fix that typical Vegas hangover. What else but pho, right?

This spot is located in Vegas's version of Chinatown, located right off the Strip. If you're taking a taxi, make sure you ask your driver for their taxi company's phone number so you have someone to pick you up. It's a frequent spot for taxi drivers, so it shouldn't take too much to describe where you're at.

Ordered the #13, which is basically pho with every type of meat. I don't know, it's not the world's best pho, but if you have the drunchies or need a cure for your hangover, this may as well be the best pho you'll have within the next hour.

Personally, my drunk Yelper self would say that they give a good ratio of noodles to broth. However, my sober and more critical Yelper self would wish there was more meat. But my drunk/hungover Yelper self wins this review.

They're open 24 hours by the way. Pho after the club? You betcha.",4
143162,JyOePY-GWFIDEkSQYUez5Q,FV16IeXJp2W6pnghTz2FAw,"Look, I come from the Bay Area... more specifically San Jose, which has a large population of Vietnamese and of course Pho restaurants, so I think I've tasted what's close to the real deal. However, of course the morning after some heavy drinking out in Vegas, the first thing that comes to a Bay Area native's mind is ""My God... some pho would be the perfect cure right now."" Hence, my cousins and I went on a hunt to find some pho. Funny thing is there is also a ""Pho Kim Long"" where we are from, so we thought we'd give this place a chance. Hopped into a cab and asked the cab driver himself if he had a favorite Pho place. And right off the bat he named this place! 

The restaurant itself is bigger than most pho restaurants I've been to, and definitely the NICEST looking. I'm used to cheap restaurants that look a bit dirty inside. This place actually has ambiance. Service wasn't too shabby as well, and honestly don't know if it was because I was super hungry (and slightly hungover) but I could say this was the best pho I've ever eaten... surprised it was in Vegas! Even my sister's vermicelli salad looked bomb and perfectly proportioned. Be warned as they only have one size and no ""larges"" for you hungry hippos. Or maybe they do, but it's not listed on the menu.

Definitely should open a location on the strip and they'd make so much money. I wiill definitely consider coming back to this place for my hangover cures if I am to return to Sin City.

Awesome broth!! Noodles and rare steak are great, but I HIGHLY recommend adding meatballs to any pho you get. Probably the best meatball in pho I've had.

I got that as well as other and one pad thai. The pad thai was very good and flavorful but as mentioned pricy for the amount that was given. The thai tea was probably biggest disappointment for me since it nearly half ice as I drank the whole thing so quickly and saw there so much ice, so I'd recommend asking for little or no ice if you get thai tea. Pho was $9 for large bowl which seemed more like a regular bowl at other places and pad thai was $12. Definitely come here for the late hours, but I suggest elsewhere for better Vietnamese food.",3

What a way to cure a hangover after a long night of drinking!!! This place is amaze-ballzzzz. Just to put things in perspective, I spent $40 for two people (tip included) on:

2 bowls of Pho
2 fresh coconut waters served in the actual coconut
2 iced coffees
1 order of egg rolls

I was mad full afterwards and fully rehydrated afterwards.

Luckily, I entered the restaurant right before their lunch rush so waiting for a table took all of two minutes before they said they had a table ready. During my almost week long stay in Vegas, I think I visited this place about three times and every time it was always full of people. From what I hear, this is the place to be come 4, 5, 6 in the morning but I don't have time for that nonsense. It was perfect at 10:30/11 a.m. for me. Honestly, the cab ride to and from and the entire meal each time was well worth the money.",5

I had the chicken teriyaki which was great, but perhaps one of the best meals I have ever had was the pan fried noodles, #62. The crab rangoon was fantastic, the best I have ever had. My husband had the pho soup and the Singapore noodles, he was thrilled with both. 

 If I could have picked this restaurant up and carried to Florida with me I would have! This was the best food I have had in Vegas yet.",5

My only problem with this place is the service. Sometimes i never get checked on or get a refil.... Cant go wrong with anything i order, i know i will like it! They also have bobba drinks to which is a plus.",4

Make sure to try all of the different sauces...the fish sauce is my favorite even though it is very salty. I had the shrimp pho, shrimp rolls, the Chinese doughnuts, and Thai coffee and I could have rolled home and slept for hours on my full, satisfied tummy!",4

My only two issues are 
1. They give you your bill on brand new American Express trays but don't accept American Express..?

2. When my boyfriend tried to order pan fried noodles she said he wouldn't like them because we're not Asian..? So he said okay and asked if he could have pan fried noodles with chow fun and the waitress still said he wouldn't like it because he isn't Asian and highly recommended him to get chow me in. Excuse me? Just because we're white doesn't mean we don't like good food.",2

Well sakino, as usual, jumps on yelp and JUST HAPPENS to find a Pho place... Coincidence right? Little Rock to Honolulu, LA to Vegas... Okinawa all the same. This Japanese wife of mine loves Pho. 
So of course, off we go..... 
I must say, it's hard for me to necessarily tell the difference between Pho (broth etc) but SOMETHING about this place just seemed slightly better. Now then that's not to say the others were subpar... Just this one is somehow ... BETTER. 
My wife, whom is some kinda pho semi-pro-am taster expert, confirmed my suspicions by vocally stating over and over how GOOOOOD hers was. 
I don't know the names. I had pho something with brisket. Large. Dumped sriracha in it and went to town. No veggies (onions etc) just meat and noodles and I Jammed out. No hassle from
Waitstaff. 
The wife got Pho Ga. Loved it. Large size. Put it like this... Of all the restaurants I review, she has never actually finished her meal, ever.... She slammed that large bowl, totaled it. That is a testament of how good/legit it was. 
Vegas can get expensive... This place was refreshingly cheap and super delicious. About 3 min drive from circus circus. Parking is a B***h but whatever, circle around until you find one. It's worth it. 
If you're visiting Vegas or a local... Get some Vietnamese in ya life... That Pho FoSho!",4

I went around 3 am and maybe the waiters were tired but it was my first time going so obviously I had some questions but they would reply very rudely and sarcastically! My boyfriend and I ordered one thing each and left! Maybe ill come back earlier one day to see how the afternoon workers are with customer service!,2

Good things is they're open 24 hours, means party hard and come there buzzed for the best food you can have after a great night. Went here the next day and tried the Broken rice with grilled pork . Every time I go to Las Vegas I have to go here at least once. There are you many other things in the menu I have yet to try, but I will haha. Prices are decent too, unlike these ridiculous casino prices and to top it off casino food isn't that amusing to me unless it's like a buffet or something.",5

Made our way to a strip mall a little off the Vegas strip. Tried the small #15. Pretty decent. Broth was superb but the noodles were a bit off for me. Not horrible though. Can be fixed with the right ratio of siracha, limes, cilantro, bean sprouts, and jalapenos. Began to work my magic and soup was delicious. 

We ordered the fried Calamari as appetizers for the table. Amazing. Must come back for these. Its the traditional calamari but with a Asian twist. Loved it. Portions were pretty generous as well.",4
143218,zknjvMwEL1Vq9t0_-SFR7A,FV16IeXJp2W6pnghTz2FAw,While visiting Vegas I wanted to give this place a try since I have friends suggesting it  to be one of the better Pho joint in town.  Unfortunately I can't seem to agree. The broth is what makes it or break it. It was dingy broth and all I tasted was salt. The meat wasn't fresh and the little amount of noodles that they gave was over cooked. Just didn't do it for me. :(,2
143219,6oFj7xVWbyP4bldBz4oBYw,FV16IeXJp2W6pnghTz2FAw,"Seriously, what a disgrace to pho!! If you want less than mediocre pho with awful service, this is definitely the place for you!  

First of all, it's in a plaza with like 90 other stores. And they mostly cater to the Asian community. So imagine a tight parking lot filled with Asian drivers. Yeah, you get the picture. 

Next, it's always so busy in there. There's no room to wait while you get called for a table, so people are forced outside. Fine if it's spring time, crap if it's in the middle of summer or winter. 

There's no warmth in the service. Idk, maybe it's just me, but if I'm going to sit down at a restaurant, I like the server to chat a little. Even just a smile, a ""how are you?"" would be nice. Nope not here. They hurdle you to the table, take your order, bring your food, then your check. Good luck trying to get someone's attention if you need something extra. On my last visit, it took about 10 minutes to waive someone down so I could put in another order to go. I see this place as a fancy fast food pho joint.

Now the food. The egg rolls are pretty typical. They are fried so you can't really mess those up. Pho broth is on the oily side, like you can see the oil floating at the top of your bowl. Noodles are stuck together like they've been waiting in the bowl for broth to loosen them up. My last visit I ordered seafood pho and it was so gross. The seafood was not fresh at all and had a fishy taste. And the squid tasted like it was on the verge of expiring. Their smoothies are pretty tasty, but stay away from the boba. It's mushy at first and they get hard as it sits in your cold drink.

The only thing they have going for them is that they are open way late and can cater to the night crowd of Vegas. I don't eat here by choice, only by the choice of others. I'd much rather drive the few blocks down and eat at Kihn Do.",2
143220,CiDD0GNh6pL8Wul5_yoc9A,FV16IeXJp2W6pnghTz2FAw,"Very disappointed!!

143221,Egj03xCWntRpa-z-s1EdXg,FV16IeXJp2W6pnghTz2FAw,"The only reason why this place gets three stars is because the food is actually really good, and it's nice to have a 24 hour pho restaurant. However, the service is absolutely HORRIBLE. It's very poorly managed, the servers are quite rude, and wait times between being seated, sitting down, ordering, and getting the check is ridiculous. I'm not sure if I'd want to go back.",3

Ugh, unfortunately, I have to say that the folks that run this place ought to be ashamed of themselves. 

I already had a bad taste in my mouth even before walking in after seeing the large banner advertising that this establishment is the best Vietnamese restaurant in Las Vegas. 

We waited approximately ten to fifteen minutes for a table, which wasn't too bad after hearing of the epic wait times for a table here. 

It wasn't worth it. The pho was extremely unimpressive, with a cheap tasting, salty broth that rendered my friend and me overly thirsty for the next twelve hours. The rare meat tasted as if it were ""improperly aged,"" as I like to term it, and was not fresh at all. Honestly, if it weren't for the dish's soft tripe, I would have given this place a one-star review. 

The pork chop that my ""aunt"" ordered was greasy and dry at the same time. I didn't think that was possible. It seemed like it had been recooked twice over. 

To add insult to injury, the basic tea was priced western-style at $1 per person. I'm sorry, but this place does not qualify as Asian due to that pricing structure. Tea is part of the dining experience at any formal Asian restaurant. 

The service was cordial but average. 

All of the above being said, if I were to give this restaurant some advice, it would be to remove that silly banner. If you need to advertise that you are the best, it means that you clearly aren't or you already had plans to reduce quality and/or cut costs.",2

Everything I've tried has been fantastic, i don't think ill ever try the whole menu but I'm pretty sure its all good based on what i have tried.  Good job Pho Kim Long!!!",5

Me and my friend both decided to start off with appetizers.. Me ordering the calamari and my friend ordering the chicken wings..

However when the calamari came it looked as if it had been sitting in Grease all day, and was not yummy at all.. And then when I told the server that I didn't like it, he did take it back but the other waitresses really rude about it.. Busting out loudly saying what is wrong with the calamari that me and my guest heard it from across the room..

Not very good customer service if you ask me.. She then proceeded to our table and asked me personally what was wrong with the calamari and I may have been a little rude but I told her it was disgusting and she got mad and walked off.. 

However my friends chicken wings are pretty alright.. Then our food came my file is really good I ate the whole thing..

So besides the yucky calamari and the rude lady my experience was alright but I would never come back again!!!

I as well order their crispy eggrolls and crab ragoons, both very delicious and worth looking like a pig in front of everybody.

I feel like you have to go off the strip in order to get good authentic Asian food, particularly pho. And you will definitely need your pho fix after a night of drinking! It's definitely one of my favorite hang over meals...I loved the flavor of the soup, and the meat quality wasn't sucky like a lot of other places.

Since we had a group of girls, there were a variety of other dishes that were delicious. Since it's been a while, tho, I can't really remember each dish...but here goes:

There was a stir fried udon plate that was really realy good. Actually, it's one of the dishes that we took back to the hotel, to-go...and later had as a midnight snack. I know, gross right? But hey, it was perfectly fine!!! No tummy aches...

We ordered the pea shoots for our veggie dish, and it complemented all the other dishes so well. It really helps to have a veggie dish to go with the meat-y, rich dishes.

The calamari (or maybe it was fried squid?) was nice and crispy, with lots of extra crunchy flakes on top. We probably over ordered here, but at least we got to try a variety of dishes!",5

I can't even remember the name of it, but it had noodles, salad greens, small egg rolls, and shrimp in it. It was okay, not fantastic- but a lot of sauce helped add some flavor.

I've passed by this location a few times, and always wondered why the interior/workers were very formal - then I found out it was to perhaps make up for the lack of good food.

The one thing I think they still do here better than most is their Chicken Pho. Since chicken pho isn't all that popular most places simply have it as an after-thought. At PKL it is done well with a very good broth.

143247,zkupiU689Ae6StEonCNlIg,FV16IeXJp2W6pnghTz2FAw,"Honestly, I don't understand the hype of this place or the giant lines.  Yes, the place is very pretty and absolutely the service is very good, but the food?  Meh.  The first time I went there was a couple of years ago for lunch and it was very good - delicious pho.  Went for dinner with a bunch of friends more recently and the quality was just not there.   I thought it was just okay.  Pho wasn't entirely hot when I got it, which was disappointing. As others have mentioned, some foods taste like they were bought pre-packaged and not made in house. One of my companions is Vietnamese and came from a family of caterers, to boot.  He ripped the place a new one over the food - spices were off, dishes were not done properly, etc.  I was genuinely disappointed as I love all kinds of Asian food and wanted to really like this place.  Unfortunately, I think they've gotten a little big for their britches, they know folks are going to show up no matter what and just are phoning it in now. 

Now when I want pho I go down a few doors to Fat Dumpling - great pho with all fresh ingredients, no ridiculously long lines, and better price.",2

Previous times weren't quite as bad but they also weren't good.",2

Was super disappointed in how much it has changed. We waited for our server to come which was about 20 minutes, to be rushed with our order to receiving the food, which was average, to waiting for the server to come back over so I could order to go. The server again rushed my order and was more worried about making sure the check was signed. I was disappointed in everything. I ended up receiving my to go order and left because I was disgusted about the way everything was. I get home to find out they screwed my to go order up....besides the horrible service, the decor was okay, they should get remodeled due to the scuffed tables, walls and chairs to the chairs cushions being torn, the bathrooms being utterly disgusting and to the fish tanks that have maybe 1-2 fish max in there. It's gone downhill, and I used to recommend this place to everyone.",1

As typical with most Asian places, service was subpar. Not even a single hot water refill, even after paying a buck for tea.

Do NOT order the spicy salt fried calamari; crazy over salted, I barely ate 2 bites.

So glad we chose this place over the pho place a few doors down. Nothing against the one a few doors down, I have never been there but EVERYTHING about our experience at Pho Kim Long was awesome. We chose this place over the other solely because the name was too awesome to pass up and I couldn't resist a check-in on Facebook.

Everything from our appetizer to the dessert was amazing. We started with the Calamari which my mouth is watering for as I write this review two months later. Very salty but nothing wrong with that! Next up for me was the pho which is hard to screw up but surprisingly some places in Oregon do. It was spot on- perfect flavor. For dessert we had the pineapple half with ice cream. The ice cream could have been served a little but it was still great.

To top it all off our server was one of the most friendly servers I've had. I believe he said it was only his second day working there. He did an outstanding job and was very personable. The whole family left very satisfied!",5

Really good pho! I usually like to do either the rare beef with brisket or flank and the spring rolls. 

Salt and pepper chicken wings are great! (The jalapeño is the pepper)

BBQ pork appetizer is great as well. 

If your feeling authentic try the braised catfish clay pot it is excellently full of flavor!

The service is very fast unless you come during their peak times then you might wait just a little longer. 

Definitely one of my favorite pho spots in Vegas!",5

And we waited another 20 mins for our order to be taken. We came in with a large group and even after waiting an hour we didn't get to sit together cause I guess It's too difficult to push tables together. And they were so pushy about separating us from each other. Everyone who works here looks so miserable while they're working like they hate their life. The service here is so rude that it just ruins the meal for you. Also the tables who were sat after us received their food and water way after us. Pho Kim Long is so dysfunctional, unorganized, and has one of the work customer service I have ever received. I'm sure there are other pho places in Vegas that are way better than this.",1

Coming here for lunch on a sober morning, we were seated at a reasonable time and given a menu to browse.  Right after that, the experience went downhill from there.  It took almost 10 minutes before anyone came to our table to take our order.  Once our order was placed, it didn't take as long for our food to arrive.

We ordered their bun bo hue and pho combination. Broth for both was simply salty.  Their bun bo hue was nothing I would have expected from what should be a spicy flavorful broth, it was rather plain and simply salty.

I left with excessive sodium intake and needed H2O to normalize.  Perhaps it is the salty hot broth that when intoxicated hits the spot, but when awake and alert... it is a different experience.",3

This time I figure I invite out of town guests at around 0230 in the morning Monday December 22nd 2014.....The initial waitress did not say a single word to us in the 4 times she went to our table and took a little over 10 minutes to make first contact. The Male waiter was short and unfriendly too, got our order and disappeared , forgot the spoons. 

The food was ok but ruined by RUDE service and the following: My guest (which happens to run a million dollar restaurant)  requested carbonated water from the soda tap (gas bubbles and water).... when we got the bill they charged it as a full flavored soda 

3 dollars for carbonated water! 
we questioned it since nowhere else in AMERICA they charge for Co2 and water, they went to get the manager (which claimed to be the owner). That younger male with an attitude of a major jerk, leaned on the table with both ""fists"" on the table, leaned over into our personal space and asked: whats your problem! 

The question of why in the name of everything that is 100% free anywhere in America he was charging 3 dollars for carbonated water and with a major attitude and tone of voice he said: 

""I don't care if I lose a customer that doesn't want to pay for carbonated water, Its 2.99 and I will not remove it from the bill"" .

Needless to say the rude waiters did not get tip and I will never go back and I will never suggest this hole again.  I am sure that punk is the SON of the hard working parents who most likely slave all morning and afternoon to get this restaurant running.....

Our server was fine but her manager Lam (or Lamb?) was a nasty person. I heard him speak so negative to our server using profanity for something that was his fault. A customer should never hear that nor should an employee be crying because of bad management. I hope the establishment takes note because we go there often in large groups but it's not worth someone suffering  over. I hope this guy gets what he deserves.

I paid with my credit card and went out to my car where I was chased down by the manager who asked me if I had paid!

I absolutely dislike saying this, but it was so clearly apparent. Our waiter was a jerk! In the entire restaurant, there was only our table and one other table that wasn't asian. Both tables were neglected and weren't even given chopsticks. Come on!!! White people can't use chopsticks? 

Our waiter also forgot my sister in laws noodles and two beverages. How do you just forget an order that you wrote down? 

And my Beef Pho wasn't very flavorful and the beef was nearly inedible. It was so fatty and chewy. But, it was inexpensive. $7-something and came with add-ins. Like jalapeños, basil and mung beans. There's also house made sauces and spicy pepper sauces like Sriracha. 

And I guess you need to go stupid early, because A) Parking is a Nightmare and B) there's a 6 p.m. dinner rush which means you will be smushed in the doorway with a bunch of grumpy people for an hour. 

It's also open 24 hours and located within Las Vegas's China Town.

     Service ranges just like the food...sometimes its terrible, and sometimes its great. I do agree with a few of the other posters in regards to asian customers seem to get better treatment and food. And i say this with the most confidence and its my friends family who owns the place and I've been with there, with her, and other family members, and we got NO discount or any other special treatment.  

Also, this place plays no games. I've seen many people kicked out of the restaurant. You too drunk? Goodbye! Your too loud? Goodbye! Rude? Sleeping at table? Taking forever to eat? Goodbye! 


     Parking sucks and the place stays busy. 24 hour restaurant. Some of the best Pho I've had has been here as well as some of the worst. 

     I'd highly recommend this place when all is said and done. Its hard to beat a place that is close to the strip, thats 24 hours. If you 10 times, you will enjoy at least 5 of those trips....but thats expected at places like this that stay this busy all the time.",3

We always call ahead and show up 30min later, usually still with another 5min wait. I have countless times seen people get upset with the wait but if you have time, it is worth it.

Best deal in town or anywhere I've actual ever ordered from for shumai (large pork/shrimp balls wrapped and steamed commonly seen served at dim sum dining. The owner makes them himself fresh, and order from them... they sell 62 pieces for $30. thats a deal! We tend to order from here whenever we have to go to potlucks or we need to cater an event. 

Their cooking is fresh when you order from them, otherwise if you base it off the food they have displayed... it looks dried and old... but surprisingly when you get catering from them... they are hella generous, always give a little more, like free donuts. and when I order tray of lo mein from them... they don't just fill it to the rim... they fill past the rim and pile and pile the noodles in the tray and it's the foil that keeps from spilling out!!! they ain't stingy with servings here. 

They have awesome fried cream cheese wontons... and they're cheap!!! 12pieces for $6.95 you can't beat that price, coz you order from Rice N Noodle (not to bash on them) but you get 4 pieces for $5 something I think... just saying. 

Honestly I would give this place a 1 or 2 star just based on the place and display of the place... but they really are a ""Rice To-Go"" establishment... order your shit TO-GO or by the trays so your food is bomb bomb and fresh!! and you'll save money than ordering anywhere else.

They didn't give us water until we flagged the waitress down several times. What's so hard about water? Isn't it almost a norm in restaurant to serve water to the guests whether they ask for it or not?

My friend wanted to order a tofu fried rice. Its not on the menu but since he saw they have some tofu dishes, he thought he could order it. We've been eating out together for years, and everytime he ask for it usually theres no problem. Instead, the waitress look at him like he's dumb and said ""I'm sorry we don't have that on the menu. But I could ask the cook to make veggie fried rice if you want."" Well why can't you ask the cook to make tofu fried rice? Both are not on the menu! Whats so different between those two? He ended up getting fried rice with egg only. He asked for a fried egg on top of the fried rice and again, the server said he CAN'T. The eggs are blended into the fried rice.
Really.. what's the difference??
At this point my friend was pissed off, so he agreed to anything.

Check came out with gratuity included and original tab with chinese writings on it and no english at all. Since none of us read hanzi, we asked a waitress to translate it, which she did, but she saw one of the dish has wrong price (it was written $9.50 instead of $13.50) so she took the tab without saying anything, added $4 to the total price, gave it back to us, and left.

Came here for lunch before leaving Vegas - and obviously not a good one at all.

We were a party of 6 adults and 2 children - we ordered 6 dishes:

House Steamed Chicken with the ginger onion dipping sauce - there were barely any meat on the chicken - quite frankly it was nearly all bones and skin.

Seafood Tofu Pot - this dish was okay 

Soy Sauce Beef Chow Fun - it was like they pour oil all over it before serving it - it was very hard to eat when it's slipping off your fork/chopstick.

Beef Stew Lo Mein with Wontons - the noodles were disgusting! it was soggy and not to mention tasteless. 

Duck Noodle Soup with Wontons - again the noodles were disgustingly soggy...wontons were bland and there was not much meat on the pieces of duck.

Chinese Broccoli sauteed with garlic - pretty greasy and it was definitely very aged broccoli 

They also charge for rice - per bowl..

Normally at the Sam Woo back at home (San Gabriel, CA) ordering 6 dishes for lunch amounts to about 30 dollars - 40 dollars at most but here it was unbelievably 90 dollars!  

The service was just as bad - it wasn't busy but had to ask several times for things plus one of the waitress openly and loudly complained about another table of diners that left - how they asked for utensils but didn't use them.

One last thing I have to say is - I can't believe this place is still in business!",1

The cashier actually told the waitress to check if it was there! When she said it wasnt, this chick tried hustling me for the tip! My brother and I were so angry that we cussed out the cashier and had a yelling match with her, saying that she had no right to charge me for tip and that the food and service were horrible.

We told the waiter who took the dish back to the kitchen only to bring same dish back a minute later. He said that the cooks told him that the shrimp were chopped very little but were there. Of course you could not even smell the shrimp nor see them. Why would they use shrimp in one dish and none in the other is a mystery. all I know is that they will never see us again and we suggest you to do the same.

Whether it's a late night where you don't feel like cooking or if you feel like splurging on your diet, there is always loyal wholesome Chinese food you can rely on. Flavor and exotic taste is the promise of the American Chinese cuisine. Unfortunately ""Sam Woo BBQ Restaurant"" is NOTHING like what was mentioned in the previous sentences. Instead of the familiar tasty Chinese food we all know and love, it was a mashy mish slop of poor cooking and over priced bland food. We had a few dishes, but more than enough to complain about. After a week's trip at Las Vegas we entered this small, dirty establishment in hopes of being greeted with a fine Chinese dining experience. Our hopes were very very wrong.

First we had ordered the Chinese white cut chicken, a salt marinated dish usually served as an appetizer or main meal. This was neither, instead it was an offensive dish to Chinese standards. There was literally no taste as if the cooks just had dumped the chicken in plain boiling water and went off to go do something else half-assed with their weak culinary skills. Several of the dishes after this were also the same, missing on any type of taste whether it was suppose to be a spicy beef cooked with eggplant or pork slices which were really soggy. They eventually served us the ong choy (chinese spinach) we ordered but upon closer observation we could tell that the vegetables were old and withered, all the parts that should be green were a sickly yellow. 

And maybe all of this could had been forgiven if it weren't for the smudgy dirty plastic dishes they used, the lack of a function AC in Las Vegas summer weather and especially the price the put on all of this tasteless food. For only 6 dishes the whole meal cost near $100 dollars! And they already threw in gratuity onto the check even though it was just 5 people eating. I guess this is the only way the waiters could actually make any tips because they seemed to lazily shuffle about and place down your food farthest from your seat. 

Overall this probably is the worst restaurant I have ever been. Definitely the worst chinese restaurant. I'm surprised how this place is still open after all the bad reviews. If these owners of this restaurant had a single shred of pride they'd do something and work toward fixing this dump and horrible imitator of real Chinese American cuisine.",1

The waiter just plopped the water pitcher down and quickly walked away.  After that, I was expecting the waiter to tell us that we needed to prepare our own food. Not once did a waiter or waitress ask if we needed more water, etc.  The only time our waiter forced an unconvincing smile on his face was when it was time to pay the bill.

On the plus side though, the food was pretty good. My family enjoyed the choi sum, chow fun with beef and the fried calamari.

Our waitress sat at the booth behind us, with another waitress swatting flies in the window with a swatter, and never even said a word when I made eye contact with her.

My Sam Woo Hot Pot was simply soy sauce, salt, and a variety of seafood, a few pieces of chicken, and a few of pork. The fish was like wet cardboard (I think it was fish?), the squid was just the body--no tentacles, and there were all of two shrimp.  It was hot, it was in a pot...that part did not lie. But it was not worth the $14.95.

At the other Sam Woo's, my favorite dish to order is the salted fish and chicken fried rice.  However in this location, there didn't seem to have any salted fish flavor.  The beef chow fun is lacking in beef.  And to top it off, the place is not as clean as the others.

I also see that they have to go boxes for rice AND DUCK. I asked the guy if I could have duck wings and feet on the to go box. He said, in his broken English, they only sold whole, or half a duck. I asked how much was the whole duck because I couldn't see where the price was on top of the board. He just ignored me and turned around. Now I was in disbelief and that pissed me off. 

  Hate being ignored. Can't he cut up some effing duck feet and wings from the whole ducks? Shit if this place doesn't sell that, like he says, which is bullshit because they have the prices and boxes. Hes lazy ass just didn't want to take the time to make it. Mind you that place was open BEFORE the scheduled time of 11AM. But closed to customers. So what the hell was he doing before that he didn't have any already cut up?

  Oh I know! He was just sitting on the table where you CUT THE DUCK reading a newspaper. Now that I write this down I am so glad I didn't get anything from here. After this I went to the 99 market and bought me some frozen ducks legs and I felt like going in and launching them shits at his face and saying, ""You don't have duck feet?""

When we got our  plates we both looked at each other with disbelief. The kiddie size cod portion with pile of rice, an egg role, and soup were all squished  on the plate as though it was just thrown together. The sauce tasted like sweet and sour rather than tomato sauce so I asked the waiter and he said it was the same thing. His duck portion looked like 1 small piece(small drumstick size) cut into small slices. Same with the pork. So small u could spoon up the slices in a spoon and eat it in one bite. The taste was just as worse as the appearance. Both  duck and pork were dry. It looks as though they just served the left overs. The egg drop soup salty. The bill was $19.36 for both. Such a waste of money. We just wanted a great meal before our long drive home. Instead we left feeling like we got conned and ripped off. NEVER will I ever step foot in that place!

Was told it would be ready in 10 minutes. That's like Jimmy Johns fast.
The drive alone took me nearly 10 minutes because I didn't know where it was- it's easy enough to find though, adjacent to the drive-thru Subway on Decatur. 

Interior of restaurant initially smells like the Subway it's next to- very odd. Service is about what you'd expect from a Chinese restaurant with four large tables of Asian families dining on traditional dishes. That is to say, lackluster service. Somehow I even had to ask for chopsticks. I was a little bummed that they didn't include fortune cookies with my check as they did for dine-in customers. Oh well, it was late (almost 10:30).

Got home and was pleasantly surprised by the packaging; the corners of the shrimp balls' styrofoam box were removed to vent so that the condensation didn't build up and make them mushy. And the crispy pan fried noodle was in a box alone, with the accompanying gravy in a lidded soup cup. Genius!

Plated the noodles and gravy, and BF tore in. It was super, super hot (temperature) despite getting there a little late and making the trek home. Hot and delicious, though I prefer a few more veggies than I got. The shrimp balls though, were legit. Small and crispy and shrimpy and tasty, with a cup of that pinkish red sauce that wasn't too ketchuppy but just right.

It's a no brainer Food Express best Chinese resteraunt in town hands down. Your doing yourself a true injustice if you haven't been here.

I don't want to judge to harshly but I know my 808 peoples from Hawaii may not like this Americanized version of chinese food.

So, here's what a group of us locals from the islands ordered:

Gau Gee [Potstickers] : umm, obviously it was the frozen brand you can find in the asian section of most grocery stores. Pan Fried.

Salt and Pepper Chicken Wings: definitely the rockstar of our meal - because there were 9 of us, we order 4 portions! :)

Orange Chicken : it was like eating Chicken tenders in Orange Sauce with Orange segments as garnish, very basic and simple presentation.

Mongolian Beef: This was good - definitely give this one a thumbs up.

Hong King Style Short Ribs: Skip this one - nothing like how it's supposed to be, instead you get a breaded version of pork spare ribs drowned in sweet and sour sauce.  Just order the regular sweet and sour pork and save yourself the trouble of having to bite into bones and cartilage.

Deep fried Chicken - Half Order : Just like its name. Needed ketchup...

Pan Fried Noodles [Beef & Seafood] - Both selections were pretty good.

Egg Drop Soup: Egg Drop Soup - 'Nuff Said :)

The waitstaff are friendly and pretty attentive, you do have to request the Chinese Hot mustard and chopsticks, our waiter was smiling and knew we weren't from the states, he stated only people not from the states order those items.

I gave 4 stars because the Family Dining experience was a nice laid back atmosphere, the food portions are adequate, and the look and feel of the restaurant was typical of its kind and clean.

However, I felt the food was pretty average - but for some dishes, not in a positive way.

Open late which was nice but the staff is not overly friendly.   Because I prefer all white meat,  I was disappointed the only item was the General Tsao menu item.   I ordered it and it was a deep fried half cut chicken.   No flavor and I had to pick the meat off the bones with two forks. 

Everything else we ordered was good.   Be aware they have an older man with a scowl on his face and others have commented that he's not friendly.   Although he was there,  fortunately we didn't have him as our waiter.",3

I was with a group of six so when the bill was brought to the table we added a 20% tip and divided by six.  We each contributed the appropriate amount in cash and triple checked for accuracy.  The busboy came and took the tray with the $168 in cash.  Shortly afterward our waiter returned to the table and slammed the tray down, accusing use of not leaving him a tip. His voice was was so loud patrons at surrounding tables turned to view the scene.  When we explained we had left him a substantial tip he all but called us liers.  No matter how we explained what we thought had happened,  the waiter refused to believe us and continued treating us rudely.  One member of our group was so embarrassed over the incident,  he left an additional $25.

Since the staff is mostly family, a customers explanation holds little valuevalue.

1st Review
Only because I have had better Chinese in LA. The food was good, service was kind of slow today. Took 10 mins to get our Check. Also Orange Chicken was brought to our table sitting  for 15 mins with the Spring Rolls. Finally after 15 mins they brought us our Pork Rice, Beef and Broccoli. I will be going back hopefully next time it wont be as busy. Definitely the best Chinese in Vegas. Mos def check it at yall...lol",5

My wife loves the honey walnut shrimp. Pretty much everything is good, but I always go in expecting to try something new, but I cannot get away from the enormous, moist, flavorful, crisp oysters served on a bed of lettuce with a dish of salt. Incredible. Another winner is the crispy duck, perfectly prepared. Since I am having the oysters I order the duck to take home for another meal. If someone or Yelp didn't tell you about this place you would pass it right by. Do yourself a favor. One of my favorite restaurants in the world.",5
150329,N4wdHG3ZLb7GwTa6blzlZA,pj0vl4DIlDCChe80Df40Yw,"Came here the other day and had Michael K order for me while I went to the ATM. While trying to order take out for us, the server was kind of rude to him for no apparent reason, so don't come here expecting good service or anything. Not that this place is nice either because it's tiny and literally a hole in the wall. I'm really glad we got our food to go instead of eating here!

The food was aight...been to Chinese places that give a lot bigger portions though, even if it's a lunch special. The Mongolian beef I got was mostly green onion and other veggie fillers and not much beef. The fried rice tasted almost like white rice with grease and veggies in it, but the spring roll was surprisingly good. Lunch specials run Monday through Fridays 11 am to 3 pm and range from $5.95 to 6.25 depending on what you order. It's a pretty good deal but I hope you like lots of veggies!

Not sure if I'll come back again, perhaps...definitely can see why it's not located on Spring Mountain because nobody would go",3
150330,W2IMqFu0dJSm2ocLHA_Azw,pj0vl4DIlDCChe80Df40Yw,I really used to love this place but I just went there and service and food sucked. First we sat down and asked for iced tea he brought us hot tea and said it's complimentary. Ok cool can I still have a iced tea. He said no so I laughed and said can I have some ice then and was told no agian.  Wth anyways I was just thinking well whatever at least I know the food is good so I order the honey walnut shrimp.  So it came out and it was a small portion for 12.95 and soggy.  Oh ya and had just tasted like it was tosed in mayo no honey. Well needless to say they lost my business.,2

150332,ktwi_xZXVAMUy3MhnZ4bAQ,pj0vl4DIlDCChe80Df40Yw,"So, howe has this place been over the years? I have decided to come back here to try out some of my favorites.  Most of the food is still very, very good, and I highly recommend this place if you want authentic cantonese food.

A.  Steamed Flounder - Steamed fish is an essential add to any true cantonese meal and this flounder was enjoyable, with the right amount of fish sauce, cilantro and onions to give it a nice taste. Would have been AWESOME if the fish was fresh and not frozen. 

B.  Salt Pepper Pork Chops - Served with fried jalepenos.  I found this to be very good overall, not outstanding but good!

C.  Steamed Pork with Salted Fish - Ah, this is a real tasty dish and I also enjoyed this one

D.  Half Chicken with Green Onion and Ginger - Met my expectations. tender, on the bone meat that is very tasty in a natural way. No overpowering flavors at all.

E.  Beef with Bitter Melon - Mom used to serve this to me all the time and I hated it. I love it now and if a restaurant has this on the menu, you can be assured that it is an authentic place. Here it was very good.

F.  Pea Pod with Garlic - Yep, this is not your Bok Choy or Broccoli. this is Pea Pod sautéed in Garlic and it is kind of like Spinach. 

G.  Oyster Sauce Chinese Broccoli - Had to order this as the kids always love it. This is prepared the way my mom and grandmother prepared it all those years.

The food here is truly authentic, and so I cannot tell you or rate how their fried rice, chow mein, wonton soup, orange chicken or any other normal type of chinese food is. I went right for the down and dirty normal food I had growing up and was not disappointed.

Why the downgrade? 

1. No other Chinese people in the place other than the waiters.
2. Nearly empty for the longest time.
3. Did not automatically serve us the ""soup of the day"" which for some of you may look like dishwater but is actually a very light double boiled pork bone soup with bits of veggies in it that is the best. Real places always serve the soup as a free appetizer.
4.  Took away our soup bowls and only had plates and forks. Hello, if you are having the Half Chicken, the Steamed fish and the Beef with Bitter Melon, all these dishes have a sauce on them that the rice absorbs oh so well and you can only eat rice properly with a bowl and chopstick.... Why set us up with plate and fork. Must be what their normal clientele use? No respectable place makes you ask for the bowl and chopstick....
5.  Prices are a few dollars higher than i would imagine.

I do like this place and consider it a solid choice to go for the most authentic cantonese food.",4
150346,bwy0xt4vEmCIuORg62oL-A,MI0OfnmlfkUh2xPhT1lQSg,"Man there was a lot of food here! The wait staff was nice and prompt. It is a buffet, and there were all ages here from babys to grandparents, so family friendly I would say yes.. The food was pretty darn good for the price! I don't know if I will be a regular here (mainly cuz I don't care for small humans, they tend to be loud) But for the price the food was better than most fast food options out there and a good mix to choose from..",4
150347,t2WZhmFRjwVaiTxO-5OgPQ,MI0OfnmlfkUh2xPhT1lQSg,"Short: Pass on it, go to Krazy Buffet or any other place. Sub-average food, bad service, terrible atmosphere.

I dropped by here because I felt a little tired of the other asian buffets I visit, and it was in the neighborhood. $6.48 for lunch for one. I walked in and was sat down promptly, but that was about it for service other than plate pick up. Crappy decorations--a staple of low-scale asian buffets--but absolutely no music playing to drown out the coughing, children's cries and random conversation. It felt like I was eating in a run-down restaurant on the side of a highway.
Food was cooked at least.... It's the typical spread you'll see at any other buffet, just not as good. All sauces were watered down to the point that one tasted like all the others. I'd guess that half of the selection of ""hot"" food was previously frozen, and the other half showed that it wasn't made very well. Half of the buffet is made up of soups, the worse of deserts, fruit and a pretty bad ""Mongolian BBQ"" side-bar. I wasn't tempted to try the sushi--though I typically risk it.


Bottom line: If you've been to an asian buffet before, this place will disappoint you. It's one of the worse I've been to, and I see no reason why someone should go here when there's a dozen others that are better in this city.",2

We wound up here after the wait at another spot was much too long. For less than seven bucks you can't go wrong. It is what it is. Low cost, mediocre food in enormous quantities is what you are anticipating, right?

There was literally no wait and we were seated immediately. That's about where three stars ends and two stars begins. There was no broccoli beef, but a small amount of broccoli chicken. They did offer both egg rolls and spring rolls with some of the hottest mustard I've ever had. The cheese wontons were surprisingly good, as were the BBQ pork skewers. Well, the one skewer that was left anyway. We never saw another skewer and were there close to an hour.

I wasn't expecting top shelf dining at a Chinese buffet.  However, I was expecting to eat as much as I wanted. How can you when they don't have any food out? It was as if they were getting ready to close and didn't want to put out more food. This was 12:30 in the afternoon. It's lunch time for crying out loud and we are hungry. 

The service was decent, as was the food we could actually get ahold of. I have to go with two stars for the simple fact that a buffet should have food or at least make an effort to fill it up when it runs empty. Save yourself the two dollars and drink water, as the price does not include a beverage. I will probably give it another shot and update the review if it warrants a different rating.",2
150354,LXv_6q6c9ffqQEihUC9Y_g,MI0OfnmlfkUh2xPhT1lQSg,"This restaurant reminds me of some of the typical buffet style Chop Suey houses we had in Honolulu back in 1980's. Though, the style of traditional Chinese menu items have change and become more Americanized since.

From the aroma as you walk in, the noise of all the restaurant patrons present, to the hustling servers, the atmosphere altogether is chaotic and amusing at the same time, and I like a little chaos.

The food encompasses many popular asian particulars and a wonderful selection of seafood fare. There is also a made to order stir fry chef for those who would like exclusive specialty dishes.

The dessert bar is simple maintaining a variety of ethnic pastries, cookies, fruit and jello molds.

For you soup lovers, there's a vareity of four options,  focusing on the more popular ones often typical in any American Chinese menu.

Good food, perfect for family or friends to gather and enjoy some easy ready chinese or American fare, definitely stop by.

If I was to recommend anything from the buffet line-here are my fave picks:

Char Sui Roasted Pork
Chicken Wings
Mongolian beef,
Pan fried pot stickers (Gyoza)

Take advantage of the stir fry specialties where the chefs will cook it on the spot!

I also consumed a Seafood Hot Pot all by myself that was bubbling with broth and steam amid well-cooked vegetables and some of the best edible representatives from the sea, including luscious scallops.

I've tried the sesame and orange chicken and thought it was good, not like Chinatown in NYC but still worthy of a mention. The chicken is well cooked and seasoned. The fried rice is much better than what I'm used to. It's not all that greasy. The eggroll isn't special, but spring rolls are always the better option anyways.

First off, I will digress. I learned a lot about Chinese food this weekend. Chopstix is noteworthy for serving ""east coast"" style chinese. I am from the midwest, so I was intrigued. Apparently ""east coast"" style chinese is more Americanized. Its more heavy sauce based/ deep fried based than your average ""west coast"" chinese. I definitely found out after eating at Chopstix that I love east coast chinese food haha. I had always wondered why chinese food in Vegas left me so unsatisfied, and its because they are so different on the two coasts! Who would have thunk?

Delivery was fast and the food was still hot. Everything we ordered was prepared very well and had lots of flavor. The thing we liked most was the value. We got enough food for 3 meals each for about $10 per person. This place is now one of my favorite for chinese in vegas.",4

As mentioned in my previous review, this place used to be SWAMPED. When I finally returned, it was virtually empty. Unable to resist sampling their changes, I proudly present my updated 1-star review.

I ordered what they used to be famous for: xiao long bao. It came out lukewarm as though it was microwaved. There was no soup in the dumpling, and the meat was very tough. One of the worst xiao long bao's I've ever had, to be quite frank.

Next on my list was the salty rice roll. This was excellent, and I give them full marks for this. However, it's such a banal dish that it's really child's play.

Finally I had the spicy chilled cucumbers. This was absolutely awful. When prepared properly, the spicy sauce is hot and addicting and delicious. When made incorrectly, however, it's just like mixing a cold vegetable with tons of hot sauce. It won't taste good.

The food is great (except sometimes its hit and miss). We always order the soybean milk, chinese fried donut (don't know what they are called), pork sung, fried donut wrapped in sticky rice, scallion pancake and sometimes my mom order others items but those are the basic we always get.

152587,-pvS8TtCIbh4mQlDpVikPQ,Tigw_9LXyHL63Eu3XAXwRw,"This is one of the few times where Yelp reviews have let me down... because I LOVED the food here. I came here reluctantly because of the low rating, but my Aunt really wanted to eat some Szechuan cuisine while we were in Las Vegas. But maybe my low expectations were a good thing, because I was pleasantly surprised at how good the food was.

Here's the breakdown!

*Food:
-Pork intestine in clay pot: SO yummy!! This was flavored with a sour and spicy sauce, it was really delicious and the intestine was cooked perfectly. It didn't taste too pungent and it had the right amount of softness. 

-Sizzling rice dish: Delicious. The sauce was sweet and savory, and I loved how it complimented the texture of the crispy rice. One of my favorites from what we ordered.

-Eggplant with garlic sauce: Cooked to perfection! It had the right amount of spice and sweetness and the eggplant was soft with a bit of crisp on the skin.

-Szechuan beef: This was okay. You get A LOT of beef, but it was just all spice and salt and lacked that extra pinch of flavor to take it to the next level.

*Service: It was a little slow because there was only one waiter for the whole restaurant. He was pretty nice and accommodating when he was serving us, but we had to flag him down sometimes. 

*Price: Pretty cheap. Around $10-12 for each dish, which is not bad for dinner.

*Ambiance: The restaurant is pretty spacious, however, some of my dishes weren't very clean prior to eating and I had to switch them out. But that's pretty typical of most Chinese restaurants, so it wasn't a big deal. 

So this is one of the few times where I'm just going to have to disagree with the majority on Yelp. The food is great here and they know how to cook most Szechuan dishes just right. 

*They also offer free wifi inside!!! What Chinese restaurant does that? MAJOR plus!!",4
152588,Wit1x8kzkZKezwtNWrkvQA,Tigw_9LXyHL63Eu3XAXwRw,"Ive been coming here for years. Its right in the Chinatown district. The food quality is very high & very good. You consistently get the same quality every time you come here. If you decide to eat in, the restaurant is cozy with ample table room and is a very quiet setting. Service, however is hit or miss.",3

Every family trip (about once annually now) we would come down to Chinatown to grab some good eats. In the past this restaurant was bustling full of people, service was quick, and portion/food was great.

Seems the prices haven't changed too much but the food quality, portions, and slow service (with noone else in the restaurant) have dropped off. Some of the plates were okay, but most were bland, over-salted, or had enough oil to make a soup out of.",2

152591,1pjZwhNXa1DPxVs0YebwAQ,Tigw_9LXyHL63Eu3XAXwRw,"Brought my book club here for an evening of discussion and great Chinese food. In addition, the website boasted 1.99 glasses of house wine. We checked with server and asked about the wine specials and were advised, no, they were 2.99. Still a great deal, wine for all!

The place was packed, the 6 of us ordered our entrees and were told it would be awhile as they are busy. Within 5 mins, one meal came out, 5 mins later, the next and so it went for 5 entrees.

One of our group ordered combo fried rice, which finally came out 15 mins or so after our last served entrée. They should call this ""fried rice"" white rice with peas. Looked awful, boring and bland. The taster confirmed this was the case. As was the case with the tofu meal ordered by someone else.

Garlic eggplant was good, lo mein was good also.

The kicker came with the bill, three glasses of wine $14.98. Also on the bill, 3 side orders of rice, which were not ordered or received.
I call the owner over and advise we were not charged correctly as the wine should be 1.99 according to webpage or even 2.99 as confirmed by the waiter. Well, this woman just screamed, ""website old, not good prices, new owner, no you pay this price!!"" on and on. When we advised the waiter stated 2.99, she then yelled at him, handed me back the bill and said ""no, pay this thank you"".

Really?? 

Then, as we were leaving after paying the bill , she comes and says ""give us another chance, we will give you free dessert next time and we will change the website"". I think not madam.

There are plenty of good places to eat in Chinatown, this place is not one of them.

From their website: Apparently, you pay what they say, regardless of what is advertised.

152593,dRmavH4fdCezsEGLiwwyDg,Tigw_9LXyHL63Eu3XAXwRw,"I would consider my family and I really good critics of chinese food as we have been all over the country trying chinese restaurants.  This week we were looking for a chinese restaurant in the Las Vegas Chinatown area and found this place.  We should have been wise and not bothered when we only saw a few people in the restaurant for dinner.

There seem to be only a chinese lady(I think the owners wife) working all aspects of the restaurant.  She was taking orders, getting drinks, cleaning table, etc.  She was all over the place which had us waiting.  Needless to say the serve was extremely poor.  The food we ordered was even worst.  No flavor, no taste.  One of our crispy fish dishes was not crispy and was very soft.  We told her the problem but she didn't care.  Please save your money and go somewhere else.  Panda express is way better than this place. By the way, the owner was having dinner and never bothered to help her, even when more people arrived.  Stay far away from this restaurant.",1
152594,b6TFMML95xlH5MLhZLtrxw,Tigw_9LXyHL63Eu3XAXwRw,"Yaaay! I'm always excited when I get to write a one-star review! Trust me, it is NOT often that I write a one-star, you have to be truly horrendous to get a one-star from me. Well, truly horrendous is the perfect description for Emperor's Garden. 

Firstly, I didn't pick the place, my traveling book club met there. Being Asian, I tried to be open-minded about it, as none of my Asian Yelpie friends seem to dig this place. I  was pleasantly surprised when I walked in to see it wasn't Americanized at all, actually it's smack in the middle of Chinatown, and the place is just as run-down and stinky as the rest of it (this is not an insult)!

The place was packed with Chinese people, a tour company had taken over the place for dinner. Why would Chinese people from China would want to eat here? I have no idea. Maybe the horrendous service reminded them of home? 

The food was mediocre to bad. The highlight of the night was the eggplant, it was decent. I got the combination fried rice, which was bland and simple, cooked more in the true Taiwanese style than the American style. I tried the Seafood Lo Mein, which was decent, again bland, as authentic lo mein is, but not enough seafood. Nothing about the food wowed me, 3-stars at best. 

The one-star is because of the horrible service. The place has a full bar and someone in my party mentioned that house wine was $2 a glass. What a deal! She had even mentioned it to the waiter, specifically asking if the glass was $2, and he mumbled something like, ""yes, we have it, but it's $3."" The other lady at my table said, ""I would like the $5 glass of wine, NOT the house wine."" Soooo...  the wine comes, and just for fun, everyone tried the $2 wine (I swear it was the two-buck chuck they sell at Trader Joe's) then we tried the $5 wine. IT WAS EXACTLY THE SAME! But we laughed it off. We were having fun and the lady didn't seem to mind paying the extra $2.

The bad service came when we got the bill. They charged everyone $5 for a glass of wine. When we complained, the OWNER said that's the price and we have to pay. WTF??? We even pulled up the website to show that the house wine was $2 and we specifically asked when we ordered. The OWNER said that it wasn't her website and she would not honor the price. LOL. Well, the address was the same? The name of the restaurant was the same? I guess someone with a huge vendetta against this place took it upon themselves to make a fake website and sell glasses of wine for $2. HAHAHA. What a bunch of bullcr@p. And the OWNER was getting nasty about it, she was so upset we weren't going to pay the extra $2! Her restaurant was packed, we just rang up a $200 bill and she was upset over the $2! 

So we did what every vindictive 'Murican does, we took it out of the tip. LOL. Duuuuh... The OWNER then had the audacity to tell us if we come back, we can have a free dessert. Uh... no. 

They also padded our bill with things we didn't order, like bowls of rice and something else.... but they promptly took it off. 

Overall.... just a miserable experience in a stinky rundown place. Will not come back.",1

Do you know what's worse than losing money in Vegas? The answer is coming here for Taiwanese style breakfast  ...

I don't even know why I came here in the first place, but our group saw the word ""Yong He Soybean Milk"" (永和豆漿) and the rest is history. ""Yong He Soybean Milk"" symbolizes a famous Taiwanese breakfast restaurant and everyone nowadays just abuses its name. Breakfast is available from 8 AM to 2 PM.

There was only one server at 8 AM and he doesn't seem to speak English, but at least he speaks fluent Mandarin (errr ....... yay)! 

Soy Sauce Flavored Soybean Drink (""Salty"" Soy Milk, $3.25): ""Salty"" soy milk is one of those Taiwanese breakfast item not everyone would love. It contained vinegar, Chinese oil stick (youtiao), sesame oil, and some green onion. Emperor's Garden version of ""salty"" soy milk was a bit disappointing. (2/5)

Shrimp & Chicken Wan Ton Soup ($9.95) - Wow ... $10 wonton soup. I would THINK all food items here would be pretty cheap because we are in the middle of Chinatown. Tasted really whatever and $10 price tag didn't help. (2/5)

Chinese Style Egg Taco (Taiwanese egg pancake, $4.5): One of the most tasteless Taiwanese egg pancake I've had ever. (1/5)

Expensive food, below average taste, somewhat dirty restroom, and pedestrian service. I mean ... talk about ONE (like one-star) amazing experience that I probably want to forget.

P.S. - Emperor's Garden serves Sichuan style cuisines for lunch and dinner.",1

What a terrible experience! They used to be pretty good a few years back - but trust these reviews, as this place has really changed!! 

Came here over Christmas break 2014 with the family. Being from the Bay Area, we know what a good Taiwanese breakfast entails, and this place is far from it. It was way overpriced as well.

What we ordered:
Salty soymilk: Tasted bland and flavorless. 
Sweet cold soymilk: Way too sweet. Lukewarm, not cold. And $2.85 for a glass of sweet cold soymilk? Average nowadays should be $1.50, maybe $2. 
Egg taco: Edible, but just some plain eggs around a flat pancake. Quite boring. Didn't even have green onions.
Mixed noodles (拌面): Where are the noodles?? Barely any noodles on the bottom of the bowl with some strings of cucumber. Not worth the $7.95 at all!
Spicy beef pancake (牛肉夾餅). The beef was OK, but the pancake was hard and tasteless. Not at all fluffy the way it should be.

The final kicker; they add a mandatory 15% tip. WHAT?? I've only known fancy Western restaurants to do that, and even then it's only at dinner time. They must be losing business and is desperate to try and get whatever they can from their customers. No one's coming back again anyway, I guess there's no harm in ripping that extra tip from them now.",1

As this is a family style restaurant, we wanted to get around 6 - 7 items to share amongst each other. The entrees we got were;

Peking Duck: probably one of their best things here, good sized duck, lots of meat, very crispy skin, comes with the white bun and colorful shrimp chips, wasn't overly salty. 
BBQ Combination Platter 1/2 size: This was my favorite along with the duck, I probably would have just gone with the full order and just taken off something else we ordered, the dish comes with fried chicken, jelly fish, pork loaf slices, meat loaf slices, and cha shu pork. 
Honey Walnut Shrimp: Disappointing portion size, there was literally like 7 pieces of shrimp on there.....for $16 bux? Man we got jipped hard, I probably would recommend putting that money into a different dish.
Clams in vermicelli special broth: clams were good but the broth wasn't that special, it was sort of bland, but it was different than the usual ways people order clams at Chinese restaurants.
Steamed Egg plant with garlic sauce: Wasn't really garlic sauce, more like just sauteed egg plants with crushed garlic sprinkled on top, so technically, it needed some sauce.
Yang Chow Fried Rice: decent, no real complaints from this, probably need some more salt.
Pan Fried Chinese Broccoli: probably our only real healthy dish, it was good, nothing memorable from it, but we did finish it.

Joyful House has been listed as one of the best Chinese restaurants in Las Vegas, but in my opinion it's not THE best. 

My wife and I and two high-school girls from Shanghai tried it out the other afternoon for an early dinner, and they, at least, seemed to think the food was somewhat authentic. We started out with bowls of West Lake Egg Flower Chowder, which I thought was somewhat bland. Adding a small amount of chili paste and a splash of shoyu (soy sauce) helped.

They ordered steamed chicken with ginger and mustard greens with mushrooms, but didn't seem to eat much of the greens. My wife and I tried the Pan Fried Spinach with Garlic, Barbecued Pork Fried Rice and Chicken Chow Fun. The latter actually wasn't much fun, as the noodles turned out to be really thick and hard to handle. We should have ordered the skinny noodles instead. I thought the fried rice was very good. 

Serving sizes here are huge, so we had the leftovers boxed up and we found a couple of homeless guys down the street who really appreciated them.

The clams in black bean sauce wasn't that good, the sauce was super salty (we ordered it after reading all the rave reviews on it).  The sesame chicken was good, it's our safe go to dish whenever we eat Chinese food.  Our bill came out to $47.24 including a HongKong iced tea that was never refilled, a little disappointing since it cost $3.75.  Perhaps I'm just cheap but I'm used to paying $2.50~ for iced tea w/ unlimited refills.  Another disappointment was the cleanliness, lots of dust on the wood window sills along the restaurant.

The Peking duck was a bit disappointing as the skin was not as flavorful and crispy and the man who filleted the skin did not do a very good job. There were uneven pieces but nevertheless, we got to have Peking duck. The claypots were okay. The sauce was a bit heavy. The stir-fried A vegetables was the best! Over all we had a fun meal but the quality was just okay.",3

The broth of Seafood Wor Wonton Soup was quite flavorful, and the filled wontons very memorable, but a scary-looking Calamari, tough scallops, and inferior pork made the soup a story of contrasts.  Average-sized pan-fried Potstickers were good and I received my several requested condiments of sliced ginger, Sweet & Sour Sauce, Potsticker Sauce with onions, Hoisin Sauce, and Hot Chili Oil without any difficulty, and Shrimp-Fried Rice with carrots and peas was very good.  

Beef & Snow Peas with Black Mushrooms in Oyster Sauce was a sumptuous Cantonese dish, and Kung Pao Chicken had a nice level of controlled heat.  Service by the well-trained and disciplined staff was consistently on the ball and responsive to needs.

Four solid stars this time out!",4

152830,r2NNjN14A1-uKnQLxGbo1Q,zFcd_gelAUEwAvJOgiZpvg,"After a second visit I realize that not only is Joyful House above average Chinese but they are also very high end Chinese Dining.

Where else can you order Geoduck and not too many places offer Abalone. I do note that these are very high end luxury seafood items and do cost around $60. $70. a portion. They also have a variety of many reasonably priced fresh fish dishes and daily specials. Free range chicken is also on the menu. (I've never seen that at any other Chinese Restaurant).

We ordered the Sweet Corn Soup for two. Actually the portion is enormous and can feed 4-6 people. It's delicious and anyone would enjoy it. Our waitress offered us a hot chili sauce and soy sauce condiments with the soup.

I had to try the Braised Tofu with Bamboo Fungus. (I think it cost around $12.00) The presentation isn't good but the dish actually tasted good. Bamboo Fungus is actually a veil from a mushroom grown in Asia. It really has almost no flavor on it's own but does have a most interesting delicate texture and is suppose to be extremely beneficial to your health. Under the Tofu and Bamboo Fungus was a large pile of fresh Chinese Broccoli.

The Special of the day was Whole Flounder for $23.00 so we ordered one fried and it was served  de-Boned Table side.

The food in this place is really good and the service is also but they've gotten greedy. I've been coming here for years and we liked this place so much we'd come at least 2-3 times a week for lunch and other times for take out. I highly recommend the tenderloin beef in black pepper sauce with portabella mushrooms, their fried rice and spicy crispy shirmp.

The prices have been on increasing regularly and the amount of food has gone down drastically, not good business. This last time I went for dinner with my parents and we all noticed how small the portions have gotten, it was really bad and that irritated me. The only good thing is that the quality of the food is still there but their competition is very close by (less than a mile down the road) and they've been consistent for years.",3

I came in by myself and was greeted by a female waitress that didn't seem very happy. I was seated and ordered my drink. I asked about the lunch specials she looked borderline upset. I ordered the salt and pepper pork chop which was fantastic, I then decided to order the Crab Rangoon. About 5 minutes later I see an order of the lovely little cream cheese  babies headed my way...NOT...the waitress passed my table and put them on the table next to mine, ok fair enough they must have ordered them also. Not the case, 3 minutes later the other waiter comes and picks them up from them and says to me they are making me new ones. Not possible in the less than 1 minute they were in the back. I told them I did not want them. They should have left them on the other peoples table and REALLY made me new ones.

Its not the food was bad it just didnt blow me away,I find myself comparing everything to what i am used to and unfortunately it falling woefully short. The potstickers were super weak,I mean worse then supermarket frozen weak. The BBQ pork fried rice needed flavoring and was a bit on the dry side. The shrimp in lobster sauce was average. The kung po chicken was ok,and the best dish was the mongolian beef a bit of sweet and hot flavor,pretty tasty. All in all it was another just ok experience,my search continues :)",3

The hot and sour soup is delicious but the duck was super greasy and kinda flavorless.  Fried rice was massive portions. I mean, massive.

Joyful house is delicious flavor is 8/10 customer service 7/10 and the fact that they don't close til 3am in a 24 hr city gives them bonus points. For the most part I only go here for Chinese food. I recommend the salt and pepper shrimp (shells on) and the roasted duck, never dry! Can't say I'm surprised they have so many awards bestowed upon the restaurant. I appreciate consistency.",4

- Went with the $18(?) bbq combo platter app.  Options were pork, duck and jellfish and I went with the first two.  Don't know how they do it, but the pork & duck were flavorful.  
- It's a nice restaurant and an upgrade from the typical Chinese restaurant service/decor, and the menu prices seemed to reflect that.
- Definitely a good choice to eat a nice Chinese restaurant off-Strip.",4
152847,Kc3ZQLXUuk0PHD8VLj9Wrw,zFcd_gelAUEwAvJOgiZpvg,"This place is absurdly expensive and a tourist trap. They don't have any lunch specials on the weekends or a lunch menu for that matter, so we had to order 1 plate of honey walnut shrimp from the dinner menu (even though it was 2:30pm on a Saturday afternoon). 

Honey Walnut Shrimp with Mayonnaise $16.50 -- The portion was small (10 med/small sized shrimp) the shrimp tasted very fishy and like they were frozen, also barely gave us any walnuts. We did not enjoy this dish at all. KJ kitchen's version costs less, gives you more shrimp, and gives a ton more walnuts. 

Their rice was dry and tasted dirty. Not sure how a legitimate Chinese restaurant can mess this up? 

I was shocked they didn't have the real deal homemade authentic saté chili sauce in oil. They brought out the commercial bright red sambal oelek from a bottle which tasted weird and not spicy at all. Very disappointing. 

Overall our meal was not worth $20, everything was unsatisfactory.",1

This place is elegant but comfortable, you would be fine in casual wear. It is clean and the male host that met us at the door also waited on us and was very friendly and accommodating.

We ordered Mongolian Beef, Lemon Chicken, Yang Chow Fried Rice and Mustard Greens in Broth. We got our made to order food in less than 5 minutes and each dish was great. 
The beef melted in my mouth; the Lemon Chicken was crispy on the outside and tender inside; and fried rice and the mustard green dish were both scrumptious. However, at $60.86 it may be a little pricey for some but it is worth it. Nevertheless. I am giving them 4 1/2 Yelp Stars.

No spices or sauces on the table, not even chop sticks. The meat was fatty and cheap, the noodles plainly sucked and were flavorless and the whole meal was pretty pricy as well. 
If we wanted super white washed Asian food we could have stayed on the strip but dating an Asian has it's drawbacks as she needs to eat Asian food at least once a day.

Strolling in with Ricardo A for a bite to eat on a Saturday night, we realized quickly that no reservations were required. 

As soon as we walked in we were seated very quickly with menus and hot tea. At the start of the menu there is 3 dinner servings with a easy simple courses if you don't want to think to hard or simply are not sure what you want.

I selected the number 1 serving. With soup, massive plate fried rice and another plate with noodles. I can't 100% tell you what was in all the dishes but I can tell you they were pretty good with a decent serving.

Joyful house has a great seafood selection with a lot of  live crabs and lobsters swimming in the tanks on the rear wall. Although a speciality I didn't get to try any. But with other yelpers reviews it shows that it maybe something worth coming back to.

The decor of Joyful isn't a 5 star restaurant that you would find in a fancy strip casino, but what it does bring to the table is good food and prompt service.

I suggest to ""just pick any place...    I'm sure it will either be Awesome or it will at least be a story""...       Now the sound of screeching tires...   a wild left turn from the right lane and we were there...    at Joyful House.

Once we thanked the gods that we were still alive...  we checked the yelp reviews...      a lot of them... and a really good average.  Alright, looking forward to this.

So the place is kinda what I was hoping for...     something that didn't look like a high over-head ""Asian Fusion"" type place like PF Changs (all do respect to PF...   I do love the Mongolian beef)...   it's simple and to the point...    kinda like a dinner.  Think denny's.   We got seated right away and menus came out to us...   we started looking at stuff but noticed that on the first page were three combo set dinner options...   we made it easy and ordered option 1...( We are not picky...  no food allergies...     we were just hungry)

Oh My God...    Come HUNGRY

Out comes tea...     that's cool...   then a very large bowl of soup...Sooooo tasty.   

Next egg rolls, dumplings, and other assorted fried goodies.....     MMmmmmmmm

Ok now rice.   Not a little but a huge plate of the rice along with chicken chow mien...     man...    there was a lot of food....  but wait there's more

Two more huge family style plates of noodles and sweet and sour chicken.   Table now covered in food...  and good food.   We ate and we ate but alas...   we barely ate half of it.    

Listen if you're looking for the Vegas Strip style place...   this is not your place.   If you want to be seated and fed in a relaxed, local and unpretentious place, then give this a shot.   

I've read some of the other reviews about the bland food and what not and I feel bad for those people that they had a bad experience.    Clearly they came on an off day because what we got was great....

We ordered a chicken to split and it was amazing, we also ordered the eggplant which was very good as well..

This place seems to be keeping up its reputation of good food, the service was a little slow which was surprising being it was past the lunch hour and there were not a lot of people in there.

Servers were nice. But food was very low quality. Because the menu was all over the place I went for what I know. Beef and broccoli (can't go wrong there) boy was I wrong!!! Beef was low grade skirt steak. Just bad!! Had the hot and sour soup. And must admit that was good. But entrees where very disappointing. Overall I'm giving them a 1 star. I would definitely not recommend this place.",1

The servers were nice and the tea was good but that's about it.  I went for lunch and they had only been open about 30 minutes which is how I explained away the empty restaurant to myself.

I tried a lunch special, pan fried beef, and I was extremely disappointed.  The beef had a slimy texture to it and my egg roll was super oily. Won't be going back and definitely won't be recommending it to anyone. 

I should have had a V8. :-/",1
152883,3vqrERh-7YAxwmZcgftBag,zFcd_gelAUEwAvJOgiZpvg,"I remember coming here years back when they used to be in a different location (I think, can't remember that far back...).  I also remember that it was quite good, although I again cannot remember at all what I had.  I'm sure they were fairly typical dishes such as mushu or kung pao or something.  Recalling that they were good and being in the mood for Chinese, we made our way here for lunch.

First of all, no lunch menu on weekends.  We got the menu of dozen pages or so that were just normal dinner dishes - fairly expensive dishes.  Fortunately we were not looking for a lunch menu and wanted the full gamut so it didn't faze us any, but be prepared that it will not be a cheap lunch.  The menu you do get is upscale in both the menu itself and the contents with right balances of seafood and non-seafood.  

I was craving some Chinese seafood so we ordered the Seafood Wor Wonton Soup ($10), marinated spicy clams ($14), and sweet & sour crispy rock cod fish ($14).  The soup had plenty of fat wontons and ample amount of seafood, and with the large size it's well worth the price.  Spicy clams were in deep red, spicy sauce, with a hint of mala tingliness.  Loved it.  The sweet & sour was not too sweet, not too sour, with perfectly fried fish that was as tender as can be.  As good as the first two were, this was even better.  With enough unusual items on the menu, this may very well be our go-to Chinese.

Our meal came to $50 after all was said and done, but it was the best Chinese we've had in a long, long time.  Service was more pleasant than the typical Chinese restaurants, although it's all relative.  Food came fast, restaurant is clean, and traffic was brisk.  I'm torn between 4 & 5-stars, but let's leave it at 4 until I revisit.  It's really 4.5 stars.

Table-for-1 Factor:  Despite the large table-centric set up, I think the atmosphere might actually work for 1.  Maybe.",4
152884,0_8Dl3_SHoomlAL0DhmcoA,zFcd_gelAUEwAvJOgiZpvg,"This stand alone building on Spring Mountain road may not look like much from the outside, but once you step inside you might feel underdressed. With white linens and waiters dressed in suits, it's got an upscale vibe. But, most of the customers seemed to be dressed as casually as me. 

Their menu is massive. It's a large book full of items that will satisfy those looking for authentic fare and those looking for Chinese-American food -- the kind you can get from any corner take out spot.

Kung pao chicken was heavy on sauce, but a decent portion size with plenty of chicken, green peppers and nuts. Shrimp fried rice was light on ingredients (other than rice) but the flavors were solid. If you're a fan of bok choy, the mushroom and bok choy dish had just enough sauce to let the ingredients shine while enhancing their flavors. My favorite dish of the night was the tender, well seasoned beef in oyster sauce with green onions. I loved the flavors of the sauteed green beans, too with it's subtle use of heat and minimal amounts of oil. If fish is your thing, try the seabass. Flakey and delicate, it was a well executed dish with a light buttery flavor. Not as successful was the house fried half chicken. The skin was perfectly wafer thin and crispy, but the meat was bland and dry as a bone.

Perfect for large parties, it's also great for families. Kids will love the aquariums full of crabs, lobsters and other future meals.",4

152886,zk2WGDkCtWusmyWMe8-YBw,zFcd_gelAUEwAvJOgiZpvg,"It was almost midnight and all I could think about was how much I wanted some chow mein. Not the kind of chow mein from a cheap, take-out place but the real stuff. I searched Chinese food in my Yelp app and Joyful House came up first on the results. The reviews had me sold, so we jumped in the car and drove across town for a midnight snack. 

The parking lot was a little dark, but it was expected since it was so late and everything else in that little shopping center was closed. The restaurant had about two tables filled, now three once we all sat down. Must be a good place if there are people here eating Chinese food instead of on the strip at midnight. We ordered soft noodles, salt and pepper pork, minced beef with tofu and sizzling beef (came on a hot plate). All of the food arrived at the table family style and freshly made-- just what I was craving for! It was delicious and I would definitely come back again. I especially like how late the Joyful House stays open and how accommodating the service was. Our drinks were never empty and our server brought more rice the moment I scarfed it all down. We definitely felt welcomed, even when it was probably past our server's bed time (and mine, too!) 

I definitely recommend this place to anyone who might be visiting Las Vegas and craves some authentic Chinese food-- not that greasy chow mein from a fast food chain or the 'meh' broccoli and beef from a tray at a casino buffet. Joyful House does Chinese food right and I will definitely be back for more.",4

It came soaked in cheap, and unpleasant sauce that came straight from a bottle.  I wasn't even surprised when the check came and I was charged $8 more for my $22 flounder because they had used an entire bottle of sweet and sour sauce.  Needless to say I was not happy with being charged $30 dollars for an item I ordered under the clear impression it was $22.  Overall my check came to $56 including a $4 sprite.  If the floors were made of marble and the ambience was that of a 5 star restaurant I could see getting away with this but this is china town off the strip folks!

152897,z2zjcjOaaE3jBRjj8eSDSA,zFcd_gelAUEwAvJOgiZpvg,"The food quality was pretty authentic and price point reasonable; however, there was no ""Joyfulness"" in their service.  There was no greeting upon our entry.  What was uttered represented a grunt at best.  And like with too many Chinese restaurants, do not expect the server to return to check after serving your dishes.  The only person who communicated and provided some positive attention was the non-Asian bus boy, or maybe he was a waiter-in-training.  

It was a quiet night so several waiters stood a few feet from our table surveying the empty tables.  Guess they had nothing else to do; they stared at times and never said a word or cracked a smile.  

They should remove the ""Joyful"" name from their business and replace with ""Me-No-Smile Chinese Restaurant.""  If hungry for Chinese food in Las Vegas, give them a try; just do not expect a ""Joyful"" atmosphere, because that's false advertising!  Will I go back again if in LV?

I wasn't expecting much at all, but this place sure surprised me. I really liked their panang curry, and the service here was great.

The gentleman who sat us  was very helpful, explained the dishes and was spot on with his recommendations.  Brought my wife and girls a thai tea and thai coffee, on the house so they could try them.

155264,4Rf279nainhgOpFn0lAqoQ,DqzyOJTJXu0Iwi8og5DJDA,"Ah Yelp photos let me down. I've been searching for more of a Thai style Tom Kha Gai and I literally searched through all Yelps of the Thai places in Vegas to find one similar to Lao Thai Kitchen which changed owners.

I finally decided to try Ocha's version for lunch with some friends based on the photos I saw.

First of all the restaurant is huge. It was actually pretty busy on a Saturday afternoon. We were seated promptly and there was one server. 

The price points are average for Thai food in Vegas. The dishes were on average $11-$12 which is okay. There's some cheaper places and some more expensive.

The place wasn't so nice inside as the table was all beat up with some sharp areas you'll have to be careful of.

We got pad thai which was good but nothing special. Not the best but most the worst. On the plus side it did stay nice and moist. 

We got Thai beef salad which was okay. It really just tasted like it was dressed with lime juice. It was really one note. There was pretty much just lettuce and some beef slices. 

Last we got the Tom Kha Gai. It was not good. I know that Laos and Thai people all make it different and I've had this soup many times. I've heard of the sour flavor from the soup coming from lime or tamarind. This place definitely used tamarind and it was super sour and super salty. You couldn't taste any spice just salt and sour. The portions of chicken and mushroom in here were generous though. I can't say that about the pad Thai or beef salad though.

My two positives were that they gave us a generous serving of white rice & I believe the sticky rice was on the house. That reminds me their rice was not good. Sometimes you just want plain old white rice and they definitely didn't use jasmine rice. Otherwise it was not cooked well because it was dry.

Overall our lunch kind of was lame. Service was slow as our server was pretty slammed so we were barely checked on. We also got our check super late BUT they were able to split it three ways and there wasn't a card minimum which is nice. I wouldn't recommend this place",2

When I walked in to carry out, the restaurant was full with a huge bachelorette party. Two women were belting out Lady Gaga over the karaoke machine, with the rest of the party singing along.  Be warned.

Ordered Tom Kha and Chicken larb. The larb was okay.  As for the former, the reviews below are right: something is up with the Tom Kha soup. There's an odd nuttiness--almost like peanut butter--in the soup that clashes with both the coconut and any heat in the soup.  More positively, the tofu in the soup was fine, and there were a good amount of mushrooms.

Although Chinese/Thai food seems inauthentic in say LA, it's the norm in vegas.  We got the spicy basil chicken, pineapple fried rice and a third dish. Split between 3, it came out to 9.67 with tax and the portions were huge.

The food was fine. The Thai tea is only $2 but was extremely sweet (like 2x a normal Thai tea). The pork pad see ew was decent, but not particularly flavorful or salty and saucy enough.

One last comment, my guy and I decided to start a new Christmas tradition this year since I wasn't feeling well enough to cook a fancy dinner on Christmas eve.  I always thought it would be fun to go for Chinese,  a la The Christmas Story.  This buffet was the first place that popped into my head.  Thankfully they were open, although we arrived about 30 mins before they were set to close so we were prepared to have to stuff our faces pretty quickly.  So not the case!  There were quite a few tables of people still.

Not a big fan of their space because it's very tight and you could barely move about if the place is busy. Their bathroom is the ever typical Asian restaurant bathroom- like no one ever checks up if it is dirty or if the toilets are clogged! 

Food is okay- too much mono-sodium if you ask me. Some food are just completely tasteless and dry- like their ribs. Most of food are just okay and filling. I'm a fan of their fried frogs and salt-and-pepper pork. 

I've had times where the servers are super attentive and friendly, but there are times where you just get snobby ones. So it depends. Overall, this place is very filling and affordable. Don't forget to try out their $1.99 boba slush- especially the strawberry one!",3

Second, I noticed a sign that says if you don't eat all your food you will be charged (which means two things). One, usually when a sign says that it's because the food is not great so many people leave left over food on their plates (if the food was great, everyone would eat almost everything). Second when a restaurant especially a buffet is cheap on the food, then they are cheap with the quality. Thirdly, the bathrooms were nasty and graffiti writing all over the walls (this place was not in a good neighborhood). I recommend eating on the Strip or a casino.",3

Then come this loooooong broken-english explanation of how they charge, then they ask for the height of the kids, then age again. WTF!!! Just have a damn ruler at the front and do that instead if they want to charge u by height!!! In-fact, I should get charged half price because I'm shorter than 5' !!! It took us 10 minutes to get the head count straightened out ( we had a party of 14, kids and infants included) and she would bring you the check and literally stay at the table and watched me bust out my purse to pay. This is barely 15 minutes getting seated and I literally was still chewing while she stood by after handing me the check. Rude. I could have paid first!!! 
The variety of food is lacking for a buffet. i've had better. You're better off going somewhere else. However, I did come on a weekday. 
Note: My 3 yr old son was charged $7 because when they asked me for age, I said 3 yrs old and I guess they thought I said 3 feet. LOL. Other places, he's usually free. I don't have the time to try to argue with them on that since they barely speak english.",1

If you're a person who is really hungry and is craving many different kinds of food then I would definitely suggest  this place for you.

The service was not too bad, but the selection wasn't as good as it could be and the foot just not as tasty.  Some foods seemed to have been sitting there for awhile, therefore, things that should be soft were hard.

It just wasn't as tasty as Krazy Buffet or the ones in the Phx area that we like.  The place had a nice ambiance, though, the tables were a bit high for those people who are shorter.

We come from a tall family so out smallest child measures the size of a 5 yr old! so hes really tall long story short we paid $9 per kid which is RIDICULOUS 90% of other buffets charge us $4 max anyways after all that i hand her my card which the register said $138 then busts out her calculator and talking in there damn language to another women who speaks no English as well & then says total is $198. WTF!!! for what??? They automatically add there gratuity to the cost. SO basically they charged us $60 tip. After this huge heart attack & catching my breath i argued with her that how the hell are you counting the kids as a full person! Ughh soo mad at this point! whatever we pay go in & then to top it off they stick us in the damn room in the back corner  NO AC & SMELLED HORRIBLE!!! & guess what?? WITH ALL THE HISPANICS! & of course because we are Hispanic guess what! they stuck us there ! This cant get any worse ! The stupid server walks in AGAIN RUDE IN THERE DAMN LANGUAGE MORE THAN LIKELY TALKING CRAP ABOUT US WITH ANOTHER WAITER RUDELY asks for our receipt like if we smuggled in people or something!!! After yelling at her that YES we paid for all 13 PPL she insisted , at this point i was LIVID! i gave her the damn receipt & walked away. Food was DISGUSTING! had literally NOTHING!!! I have never been so upset in my life!

158246,o2mw12z7wN0Y14S2l9PZig,q28CkzJaV5yKPXysY8xewA,"Not bad. For the price you pay, it's alright. In fact, I tend to dread ""Asian buffets."" Any establishment that clumps a multitude of ethnic groups and benignly calls it ""Asian"" usually sends me running in the opposite direction. But like usual places I've no interest for, I go because I'm dragged by my friends. We're broke students with loans up the wazoo. So it's no wonder we choose cheap food that can not only fill us up but also potentially kill us. But I didn't get food poisoning here, huzzah! Friday dinner came out to be about $16+tip per person.

There is a large selection of ""Asian foods."" There's a Mongolian grill (where you choose what you want and it gets freshly stir fried). I didn't try it, but the noodles looked overly squishy and very saucy. I also noticed that my friends who got it didn't finish it. There's an area for sushi and rolls- the fish didn't look or taste fresh, but really what can you expect out of the price you're paying. Beyond the sushi and rolls is an area of vegetables and then lots and lots of seafood selections. To name a few, there were lobsters, fried crab, crab legs, fried shrimp, steamed fish, seafood soups, fried squid, shrimp, clams etc. There were also non seafood items such as western favorites - orange chicken, broccoli beef, fried wontons, egg rolls, etc. Lastly, there's a dessert bar that consists of cookies, puddings, frozen yogurt, and fruit. 

The service was annoying. The waitress pretended to be bashful and nice by saying that she didn't want to bother us later so we should pay immediately... before most of us had even finished a plate of food. We were literally in the middle of eating, mouths grotesquely stuffed, hands greasy ... and she came to pester us to pay. We were a huge group, so I can kind of understand? Although paying in the beginning before we began to eat would've been more opportune. And at least be upfront, instead of faking the bashfulness and saying that you don't want to bother us later, when you're clearly bothering us now. At one point, they lost the receipt for one of our guys, and the waiters were yelling at each other in Chinese in front of us. The rest of us awkwardly just ate while the waiters yelled over our heads. So 2 stars for service. 

I wouldn't mind coming back if my friends chose this place again. But I definitely wouldn't come here on my own accord.",3

Items to grab a second time
1. salmon sashimi 
2. Lobster - like at a dim sum restaurant
3. Prawns - like at Makinos
4. Crab legs 
- Disorganized seating.

- No dim sum. No tempura. 
- Oysters taste just like the sea...yuck. Good thing they have lemons and chili paste.
- Exactly what I expected. Great food, sloppy venue. If you can get over that, then you'll have a wonderful time.

158248,OOS8YVPFPBw3zjkCnVZwtQ,q28CkzJaV5yKPXysY8xewA,"We decided to check out this Buffet at Asia in Henderson, NV when we first visited to Nevada . DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME HERE. Upon entering this place not much of the staff spoke english, but they know how to count your money perfectly. There isn't much to write about the decor it's more like junior high cafeteria style wooden tables and small hard uncomfortable wooden chairs. There's a mediocre sushi bar near the front entrance.

The asian style ribs were so over cooked we couldn't eat them. We asked the waitress not to bring our drinks until we had gotten our food. I think the walls pay more attention to what you say then these people. Upon our return to the table there sat our drinks. Of course I requested she make all fresh drinks and watched her pour fresh drinks as well. I am very skeptical about unattended drinks and foods myself. Of course she wasn't very happy with my request and watching her back either. If you love seafood as I do such as fresh unlimited king crabs legs, fried blue claw crabs and fish etc. Now as of 2013 to present. Go to the Buffet @ Asia on Flamingo and Eastern Ave, Las Vegas. My nail technician recommended that place and we love it. 

The service is very friendly and the foods are always fresh and hot. There's a very high turn over during dinner hours from 4 pm to 9 pm. The lunch doesn't offer the same menu as the dinner does no king crab legs, fried frog legs, fried crab or pepper shrimp. The price for dinner is $13.95 you leave a tip after you dine. Alcohol drinks are extra but there's unlimited teas and water and Chi tea too. The dessert doesn't offer real ice cream it's just a frozen like iced milk. But they do have a selection of asian desserts cakes and cookies etc. The ribs are tasty but over cooked and dry. The veggies and rice are very good. King crab legs are a good size and plenty of them. But you must watch when they put them out because people grab them two plates full at a time. The atomosphere is relaxed and family friendly. They also have a huge wok station where you can choose your own ingredients too.

By far this is the best one of many of the Bufet @ asia to eat in Vegas. Be sure to dine no later than 8:30 pm because they will begin to clean the buffet to close for the night.",1

We decided to give it a try and disregard the bad reviews. It's a mediocre buffet and it's exactly what you expect from a Chinese buffet. You get what you pay for, so I can't really complain that the food was ookay. They had crab legs since it was dinner time and that made up for the other bland choices. The butter tasted like movie popcorn butter and it made me feel weird. They also had raw oysters which were decent, but I prayed before I ate them just in case I would get sick afterwards. Crab rangoons had little to no filling. Everything else from the fried rice, beef with broccoli, wonton soup, etc was bland and so-so. 
On the plus side, the staff was super friendly and nice. They refilled our drinks and took old plates away quickly.

Moreover the staff is quite friendly and pretty quick at serving the beverages. However the food...how can I say this...the food was sooo bland no taste. And for some reason right when I get my food and then sit down the food is already cold. Luckily we got there at dinner where they gave us more options. For example crabs legs, but even though the taste of the crab legs something was off. The butter for the crab legs taste like if it was old butter just being reused. 

I hate to give them such of a low rating but the fact that i couldn't eat another plate because of the taste and that my wife and I felt sick mildly sick afterwards. So like I said if your low on cash and want a buffet I would recommend but if you don't have a strong stomach and have taste preferences don't.",2

Perhaps the dealer had gotten a 21 one time too many and now you're completely broke but still want to eat your sadness away? Well look no further than Buffet @ Asia. Who can drop that much money Bacchanal Buffet anyways? For as little as $15 (that said I didn't get too good of a look at the prices if you know what I mean), you can gorge yourself alongside others determined to commit gluttony. Score yourself a 15% coupon and you even get to save some more! Maybe that $30 that you saved can lead to a jackpot! Just be aware, this is a Chinese buffet, as in don't expect the best.

Like most Chinese buffets at dinner time, the place was loaded with seafood. Most importantly, they had dim sum style lobster! For $15, you're getting all you can eat lobster. Am I dreaming and living the buffet life or what? Throw in salmon sashimi, crab legs, frog legs, and dynamite and it's a home run! Unfortunately, I must admit that the food is obviously not of the best quality. The clams were sandy and had a weird, somewhat metallic taste. The oysters weren't very fresh and weren't cleaned properly. The nigiri had obviously been sitting out for a long time and should have been disposed of. At the beginning of service, the salmon sashimi was very very good. Then, it became horrible cuts and believe it or not, I found a piece of bone in a piece. Yuck! The shrimp dynamite was deliciously cheesy and creamy but none of the shrimp were deveined. I don't know about anything else I found that the taste of the food in general was strong; it's heavily seasoned. 

Now, onto service. Holy moly! My table literally never had an empty plate at any time. There were times they carted my plate away while I still had food on it that I was getting to! And yes, most of the time, the item about to be taken away were lobsters and crab legs. My water was constantly being filled to the very blink. They were probably hoping that I'd get full off the water. 

Overall, for $15, this place is a steal. It's a bit messy but this is a Chinese buffet boy! You do't come here for world class service; you come here for food at dirt cheap prices.",3

When i crave for Chinese food i always go Cheng's.  I dont know how many time they changed management, i wanted to share with my horrible experience.  I ordered catering for my guests for a total of $200+, this was done over the phone.  Listen to this, Carol the owner took my order and asked for my full name, address, card number, expiration including the security code. April 29 my food was delivered. The delivery guy asked to see my debit card and ID. He did this manually by tracing my card so it will reflect  on the credit card form. He was very nice and gave him a tip of $20.  He has all my information. Next day i checked my bank statement online and there was these UNAUTHORIZED transactions totaling to $500+.  First thing that came into my mind is Cheng's involved, either that delivery kid or anyone from cheng's...they have all my card info, who else could it be.

I have ordered catering for my guests for a total of $200+. This was done over the telephone.  Well, listen to this, they took all my information to charge it to my debit, my name, address, card number, expiration and including the security code.  April 29, this kid delivered all my orders and asked for my information, including that he sees my debit card and ID.  So he did this manually, by tracing my credit card with a pen so the number will reflect in the credit card form, I TRUSTED HIM, gave him a $20 tip.  The next day I checked my statement online and there was these UNAUTHORIZED transactions amounting to $520 in total.  First thing that came to my mind is Cheng's Express is involved, and I'm positive that this delivery guy took advantage of my debit card, or anyone working there.  As of today I'm still debating this with my bank.
  
PLEASE BE CAREFUL IF YOU ARE USING YOUR CARD HERE!!!  if it happens to you, check your statement online ASAP. Anyway, the food doesn't taste good anymore!!! 
Thanks for the donuts, that's the only thing is good, it wasn't the same anymore.",1
160667,5z_yNDmSECY5jchNvt6imw,e-eqwMPMDXPYSdwkQbYhSw,My roommate and I like to order here when we feel like staying in and veggin out. I always get delivery here and the lady always says 30 min. Well I ordered last night at 9:07PM and our food didn't come until 10:37PM. Not to mention the food was cold and hard. I called the place right away and of course they're already closed and there's no option for voicemail. Terrible service...way to loose a customer!,1
160668,DnqjvQcdzfD_jIb6S9Wqyw,e-eqwMPMDXPYSdwkQbYhSw,"Went in today not realizing that they had changed name and owners. NEW NAME IS HAPPY WOK. Ordered Won Ton Soup and all it was was broth, house fried rice and the house chow fun and NO flavor.  The new people were not as friendly and the son (?) acts like he isn't allowed out in public very often. Pretty awkward ordering experince. Off to find a new neighborhood Chinese spot",1
160669,VmRPvgVx8Mq1xIXdD-ijFg,e-eqwMPMDXPYSdwkQbYhSw,"So, apparently there are new owners and it is now called Happy Wok.  I would always get Cheng's Express and it was fast and tasty.  I called to place a delivery order last month, Aug  2014 and was told all the delivery people were out of the country.  So I called today, 9/14/14 and found out there is a new name and new owners.  The food took twice as long to get delivered and tasted....  well, there was really no taste..  Bland and blah.  I will morn the loss of Cheng's Express and let Happy Wok go on it's happy way.",1
162044,lwg42vO9sNuyVO_MaRoJbQ,OWQJrnXbWkLTI1-qRkkUpQ,"Pretty good for Chinese food in Vegas, which isn't saying much. Over the years I've ordered from here, due to the lack of better options and occasionally their food was pretty good. Before this review I would have given them 3 stars.
This review is for my most recent experience. My food arrived cold, which wasn't a huge deal to me it just made the food less appetizing. Then I was eating my soup, pretty decent flavor, but there was plastic in it. It was a small plastic bag right in my soup. I thought it was cabbage, but when I realized it wasn't edible in my mouth I spit it out and noticed it was a small cut bag. So gross! So if you decide to order from here, check your food thoroughly.",1

Now, I don't want to give anyone the wrong impression when I describe the Golden Flower.  It's not the best or most authentic Chinese food you will ever eat.  You will not find an overly-friendly wait staff.  What you will find is a business that caters to the local lunch crowd, and they are damn good at it!

Lunch specials range in price from $6-$9. Specials include choice of soup, choice of rice, an egg roll and a cream-cheese rangoon.  Definitely try the pork fried rice. You will be pleased. I also recommend trying any shrimp dish.  The shrimp is always plump and flavorful. 

The staff does a good job of getting you in and out fast. Sometimes the entree will arrive before you finish your soup. But the staff is not trying to get rid of you. They just serve the food immediately as it leaves the kitchen, which is great if you need to get back to work, but give it a minute to cool before digging in.

Just to let you know, the Golden Flower has survived in the same location for 20 years while every other surrounding business has at one time or another had to close it's doors.  That's a testament to how good they are at what they do, and they have done it consistently for a very long time.

In a town with a tradition of imploding old casinos to make way for new ones, it's always nice to visit a local haunt that hasn't changed over the span of a generation. Don't ever change, Golden Flower. Don't you ever change.

FYI - There is a surcharge when paying with a bank card for totals under $10. Also, ask for the check when you're ready. They won't always bring it automatically.",4

162048,XDUFcioXIlRoefkAaz0YbQ,OWQJrnXbWkLTI1-qRkkUpQ,Being coming here for over 15yrs one of the best cheap Chinese food places in Las Vegas always clean and friendly and of course the food is amazing.,5

We are in from LOs Angeles, so we didn't know where to go for Chinese food. We got there sign on window says this place was voted best for 2013. I'm not sure why?  We ordered egg flower soup, chicken chow main and chicken with pea pods. After my initial hunger feeling was gone I tasted the chow main and that was disgusting. I ate the pea pods, then my stomach started hurting so I stopped eating. My husband had the same reaction. We asked fo the check and the waitress was like you want a box? No thank you. 

Now were driving, chewing gum to get rid of that bad taste. Never again. 
Same reason I stopped eating Panda Express the quality and taste.",1
162050,cFL72fFnPb11UbLEhrbxtg,OWQJrnXbWkLTI1-qRkkUpQ,"Wow after sitting bookmarked in my Yelp log I finally got my booty over to check out what all the fuss is about!

We were not disappointed and found out first hand what all of the rave reviews were about!

We started with a hot pot of Oolong tea which is a nice option and treat when dining out for Chinese and that is not always an option elsewhere.

We ordered an appetizer of fried shrimp and it was yummy, the shrimp and the fried coating was delicious.

We also decided on an order of sweet and sour shrimp which was very good as well! It was more of the same yummy fried shrimps mixed with carrots, onions, and bell pepper in a delicious sweet and sour sauce which comes with white rice.

We also ordered almond chicken which was full of white meat chicken, generous fresh slithered almonds in an Amazing light brown sauce that had a hint of sweetness.

This is a true Cantonese style Chinese restaurant which has always been my favorite.

Golden Flower reminds me of the exceptional Cantonese restaurants we would eat at back in the 80's in the Pacific NW.

The service is great and the prices are Outstanding especially considering their generous portions! Our bill for an appetizer and two full entrees was $24 which was ridiculous good considering all of the food we were served, we even had to take some home as we could not finish it all. The Quality, Service, Flavor, Portions and fair pricing is alive at the Golden Flower.",5
162051,UpBvmM9uDMBJwPnkGAeGgw,OWQJrnXbWkLTI1-qRkkUpQ,Small little place. Would have never thought to come here if my classmates didn't drag me there on our break between classes. Huge portions for the price you pay. Food tastes okay. Ordered the Kung Pap Shrimp & only got like 7 pieces and the rest was vegetables which was pretty disappointing. Overall okay food. Will probably be back if I'm craving Chinese food while at school.,3
162052,gsm4F_gC2UXjhDMJ40_eHA,OWQJrnXbWkLTI1-qRkkUpQ,"I had this a few weeks back and loved it. It reminded me of a few places back home that I enjoyed and greatly miss since moving out to Vegas. I ordered a Combination Lo Mein meal that came w/ your choice of soup and an eggroll, both were really good considering I dont typically eat either one. Then the entreè its self came and that was pretty big for a single person, I ended up taking it home too and tasted pretty good cold. I will be going back again.",4
162053,VxxbcOCUq7-7aD7hGzB1pA,OWQJrnXbWkLTI1-qRkkUpQ,"So we found this spot by the house. Came first for dine in. Small restaurant but that is why we like it. I dislike crowded restaurants.  I like to be able to enjoy my meal. 

Looks like a lot of the business is take out too. We have now ordered here twice in the last week.  Still miss my Chinese food style from Hawaii but these guys are good!  This has become my go to place.",4
162054,l0WoPFT7BANb6mZAhCNZ6Q,OWQJrnXbWkLTI1-qRkkUpQ,"After reading the reviews we had high hopes, but they weren't met.  The service was friendly, attentive and prompt.

We tried the following:
Tempura shrimp = tasty, light and perfectly cooked.
Eggrolls = okay tasting but extremely greasy (HOT oils down the chest when biting into one not the best experience.)
Kung POW Chicken = okay flavor but overrun with cheap filler of zucchini and the peanuts tossed over the top as an after thought not cooked in to pick up the flavors.
Shrimp Fried Rice = Shrimp cooked perfectly however the rest was flavorless; plain rice with barely any color, white onions and egg.

We checked this into the ""well we tried it"" category but won't be back.  :(",2

I know about this place because when I first moved to Vegas, I worked in this area.  Ive had General Tso Chicken, The House Combination Rice, The Chicken Fried Rice, Moo Goo Gai Pan, Beef and Broccoli, Lo Mein and a few other things Im sure but those are our favs!  On the 25 minute drive back home, by the food is still piping hot!  AMAZING PLACE, tons of food and will  never go to another place in Vegas, not that I have in the last 4 years since being disappointed time and time again by the places in our area!",5

After looking over the menu. This is an American Chinese restaurant (like pandas)
So no har gow, pigs feet, etc served here.
4stars:
I love eggs so I ordered the house egg foo young, no pork. It was excellent even with the gravy, soft and delicious. 
3 stars:
The beef with pea pods was tasty. Beef was soft. This dish needs to be eaten at the restaurant. Does not serve well as a take out  (pods wilt)
The chicken asparagus was good but nothing special. 
1 star:
The hot and sour soup was not my favorite. Kinda sweet.
I will try this place again when I'm stuck fending for myself at home.",3

My only beef is the strawberry chicken isn't served during lunch. Four stars due the water downed sweet and sour sauce and the servers always seem like they'd rather be elsewhere, they're polite, but it's all so automatic. Also, maybe an update on the dining room and dishes.",4
162058,amq4g23Ycrr3V92wGlXWnA,OWQJrnXbWkLTI1-qRkkUpQ,I searched & searched for good Chinese food in Las Vegas and I finally thought I found it. Unfortunately this is just decent Chinese Food.,3

We got in there and the decor was horrible, but after we ordered and the food came out, we were happy.  We are used to buffets but we split the orange chicken and the beef and broccoli and we loved it!  It was seasoned great, it was hot, and it was inexpensive.  I would recommend this place.  Just ignore the location and give it a shot.",4
162060,p-XTXIANTAU9cfFhMpM0vw,OWQJrnXbWkLTI1-qRkkUpQ,"After having lunch here today,  I will never go back!   First warning sign is that the restaurant is in the decaying and basically uninhabited Pecos Plaza. 
2nd warning sign; upon entering the place it was packed by obese Caucasians (except for two slender men) and very few Asians.
3rd warning sign; when I asked for chopsticks the waitress laughed and walked off.   I use chopsticks at home as I find it paces my eating and allows me to be more in touch with my food.   With a fork it is far too easy to just shovel it in.

The reason for 1 star is there is no option for zero.   The two waitresses acted as if they were not wanting to be working and barely interacted with the customers.   I realize that in some Chinese restaurants service can be slow or haphazard but this place takes it to a new low level. 

The food quality is good but flavorless.  I had the chicken bok choy lunch special.   It comes with soup, an eggroll and 3 cups of white rice.  Oh and also the flatest understuffed crab rangoon in the world.  While the chicken and bok choy tasted fresh it was swimming is a glossy brown sauce that tasted like watered down soy sauce with a little corn starch thrown in.  I avoided the rice, egg roll and very flat crab rangoon as they did not look appealing. 

While I picked through my lunch I witnessed one customer walk out because it was 30 mins and they had no food.  Mine took 15 minutes.  Instead of calling this a Chinese restaurant it should be labeled as an American restaurant with a Chinese influence.   I think the only reason this place manages to stay in business is because their Caucasian clientele doesn't know what good and authentic Chinese food tastes or  looks like. 
I rarely give negative reviews but this place pushed all the wrong buttons today.",1

I was not disappointed at all, great price, huge portion size and friendly workers. Food came out fast and yummy. The BBQ pork fried rice was prepared so good, I finished it completly. Had to even order some more to go. Definitely a place to check out if you want some good Chinese food. They even deliver and take out if you don't want to dine in.",4

Starting off, congealed Sweet & Sour Sauce stuck to two pages of my menu.  Promised hot water for tea was forgotten, and so was my entire order of Chicken Chow Mein.  Fried Rice came late.  And there were no paper towels in the men's restroom.

The food that did arrive was very good though.  My party of four enjoyed very good Pot Stickers, Three Flavored Sizzling Rice Soup without pork, Chicken Chow Mein, Beef with Pea Pods, and Walnut Shrimp.  And, for the second time some mains arrived in shifts rather than all diners being served at the same time.  When servers are not harried by waiting on large crowds, and pay attention to details, eating Cantonese fare here can be an enjoyable and tasty dining experience.  

I will hope for noticeable improvement, and call here again another day.",3

She basically ignored our table and was bothered anytime we did flag her down and asked for something. The other 2 in our party of 3 got tea refills but she ignored my request and didn't even bat an eye my way. I'm tired of always getting  that bitchy no personality waitress.

I have 6 g-kids and they love going here.  the portions are NOT small by any means and we never have to ask for a refill on anything.  I am going tomorrow because I'm craving some won ton soup.  yes, it is a small restaurant.  I think they have about 12 tables but that does not take away from this fine establishment.",5

The Beef with green beans was good.  No weird fat bits and the flavor was good.  Not spicy.

The Kung Pow chicken was flavorful, but should have been spicy as it had the pepper icon by it.  So, not the best.

The Chicken Chow Mein was awful.  There was nothing wrong with the chicken.  It was weird looking, but tasted good and no weird texture.  I think they must pound it first so it looks different than usual.  The noodles were the average type used, but the sauce they used on it just tasted awful.  I have had Chow Mein in no less than 30 places in my life and they usually taste pretty similar and are a almost sweet soy flavor.  This was just bad.  Won't order it again.  There is a place in the shopping center at Serene & Eastern near a German Bakery that is much better all around.

162073,r78SFCUvvIH3dvSeji8Qyg,OWQJrnXbWkLTI1-qRkkUpQ,"""After being on a cross country flight from Fort Lauderdale to Las Vegas to meet up with my brother and a week on vacationing on the Strip, I was anxious to see a real locals restaurant. My brother drove me to a nice Chinese restaurant in a happening Von's shopping center called Golden Flower. "" In reality if Yelp was in existence ten years ago in the summer of 2014 this is how I would of started the review. Golden Flower Chinese Restaurant holds a place in my heart because it is one of if not the first locals Chinese restaurant that I visited in Las Vegas when I was living in Fort Lauderdale ten years ago. For at least ten years Golden Flower has been blooming in the very injured shopping center at the corner of Pecos and Russell Roads. Where this shopping centers Von's, Denny's, New York Bagel shop, Starbuck's, and so on rest in peace, the spirit of Golden Flower Chinese Restaurant is alive. 

  It was yesterday before I attended the Alcohol Awareness Training class that I wanted to take advantage of a nearby Chinese Restaurant luncheon special. After a near decade hiatus, I was returning to Golden Flower Chinese Restaurant. 

  Golden Flower is still the same cozy Chinese restaurant as I remember back when the Outcasts ""Hey ya"" was topping the charts. It brings back further memories of the cozy Chinese restaurants in Long Island, New York. The oldies from the 1980s and 1990s added to the relaxing environment. Listening to the acoustic version of ""Hotel California"" made each bite of the shrimp chow mein that much more enjoyable. 

  More than the cozy environment and music, the service left me with a better taste of the Golden Flower. From the time I stepped inside to when I paid, Christie was very welcoming. She invited me to sit at any table in the relatively small dining room that was sparsely populated by diners. She was on top of refills and would always say, ""Thank you."" Ultimately she never rushed me. I'd overhear a couple of customers thank Christie for the great service. 

  The luncheon specials are a good deal. They are in affect Monday to Saturday from 11 am to 3 pm. In similar style to the luncheon specials throughout the Las Vegas Valley the price is between $5.95 and $6.95. the reality is that when you add a glass of Coke, tip, and tax it comes out to the figure of $11. But the Coke could be unnecessary because I vividly recall the delicious hot tea here. Let me talk more about the lunch specials. They include either egg drop or hot and sour soup. But, if you love wonton soup like I do, it is $2.25 per person. There is more. The lunch special also includes an egg roll, crunchy noodles with duck sauce and spicy mustard and either BBQ pork fried rice or steamed rice. The lunch special features an entree. The choices include numerous styles of chow mein, pepper steak, curry chicken, and sweet and sour chicken (I posted a picture of the menu in this business listing). 

   I ordered the shrimp chow mein luncheon special. The crunchy noodles were decent. I am a fan of the wide noodles and not the skinny ones they serve here. Regardless they went good with the spicy mustard. Before I could get more acquainted with the noodles, Christie placed the hot and sour soup on the white tablecloth. The soup tasted hot and sour. The next visit I intend to pay the $2.25 for the wonton soup. The egg roll which reminded me of a spring roll was Panda Express allright. Now the portion of the shrimp chow mein with fried rice was enormous. The quality was magnificent. In a couple of my previous reviews on Las Vegas Chinese Restaurants I voice my opinion that the chow mein noodles are filler food. Golden Flower serves flavorful chow mein that hint of lo mein sprinkled with generous amounts of chunky juicy appetizing shrimp and sprinklers of onions. This is an example of both quantity and quality. The Best of Las Vegas has bestowed Golden Flower with The Best of Vegas awards in 2002, 2008, and 2012.

  In hindsight, I am cognizant of the fact that somethings stay the same. In the period of a decade Golden Flower is still the same local Chinese Restaurant serving remarkable Chinese food luncheon specials in a cozy environment. In the period of a decade I remain a fan of Golden Flower.",4

I have been craving it since, I dream of it, I need it, I want it more and more.


I have 12 check ins at Golden Flower and every single dish I try is just as Amazing. The staff is Fantastic, the food is top quality and the prices are low for the giant portions.

Good size shrimp and the walnut sauce is what I expected.  Salt and pepper pork chops is my favorite.   It reminds me of this family chinese place we used to go in Long Beach,  CA.  Fish with black bean sauce was good also.  I wasn't too crazy about the appetizer,  BBQ ribs,  it was a lil tough.   Defintely going back to this place.

I ordered the pad Thai noodles, chicken chow mien and egg rolls.  The best thing we got was the chicken chow mien, but don't get too excited it was the best of the worst.  They do give large portions of food, but I like quality over quantity. The pad Thai sauce tasted like it came from a box. Most of my order went into the trash :( the egg rolls hardly had any meat in it.  We asked for hot mustard as a condiment and we got some weird concoction of curried spice with French's yellow mustard.  Needless to say it was disgusting. 

I was super sad when they said they don't make walnut shrimp, but hey it happens!  They have cashew shrimp, but after reading the ingredients I knew it was far from what I wanted. 

Maybe it was a bad day for the chef?! Regardless I doubt I will be coming back.  I was super excited about trying this place too because of the ratings and reviews.  I am severely disappointed.  Perhaps it's because they try to cater to two different types of cuisines.  Maybe they should concentrate on being a Chinese restaurant and drop the Thai stuff.",1

But after our experience in the Las Vegas desert, I feel obligated as a man of decency to contribute and help those who would befall the same fate as we did. The debate began with a growing urgency for sustenance, as we were reeling from a heavy day of soaking our livers in beer, tequila, Fireball, and some ungodly concoctions called ""Buzz Balls"". Mr. Chop Chop arose as a solution because apparently, crab rangoon was not available on other delivery menus as far as we could tell. Why we were even considering ordering seafood for delivery in any form while in the middle of a goddamn desert is beyond my comprehension, but the group was insistent. We placed a large order to feed six and were told that delivery would be a one hour affair. With time to kill, there were a few beers left and the film ""Tower Heist"" was airing on television. If you've ever seen ""Tower Heist"", capped by brilliant penmanship and epic performances from Ben Stiller and Casey Affleck, then you know that such a cinematic gem can only build your appetite for the finest Asian cuisine, because you are literally starving for quality after watching such schlock. Enter Mr. Chop Chop, not one, but two hours later.

The crab rangoons looked like they were previously used as suppositories in a subsidized retirement community. Usually having no crabs in Vegas is a good thing, unless you're expecting it in your food as opposed to your nether region. I could not surmise a more pathetic excuse for this staple of Ameri-Asian cuisine than what revealed itself in those styrofoam containers. Suffice to say, they are rotting in a dumpster somewhere in the bowels of the Wynn property.

The chicken chow mein noodles tasted as if God decided that sodium no longer had a place on the table of periodic elements. Consider the effect on our ecosystem if this were the case. All sea life would perish, average blood pressure would drop, and Mr. Chop Chop's cooking would still be available to damn civilization. I made it through about five bites before wisely placing the carton in the $25 incidental refrigerator we had delivered to the room. Some poor sap was going to get drunk later and eat that. But I knew it wouldn't be me. 

In the aftermath of eating, everyone in the group was writhing in pain. There was no satisfaction on the miserable faces of my companions. People would disappear randomly in 20 minute intervals and I can only imagine that this was time spent slumped over the toilet in a desperate attempt to void our bodies of the filth that was Mr. Chop Chop's plague. Ipecac syrup would have tasted like holy ambrosia at that point. 

To those that wrote positive reviews, I have two theories. One is that you have personal ties to the restaurant, which is totally fine. People come onto Yelp all the time to defend their establishments, however fruitless and absurd it may be. The second theory is that you've never left the desert, nor eaten any other Asian cuisine in your life. I'm not here to knock you down or criticize your taste. Many find comfort in bland, diarrhea-inducing food to ""flush"" themselves, and I respect that. This beef is between me and Mr. Chop Chop. And should this beef ever resolve itself, it certainly won't be in any dish served by this restaurant in the lonesome outskirts of the Las Vegas strip.",1

Excuse me, but do you work there? If so I am sorry if I offended you or your wife on her cooking, although last time I checked Yelp is an open forum for people to share individual opinions on dining experience with others.  Maybe you should use this post as constructive criticism rather than resort to childish rants on women's 'monthly cycles' as though that would be a reason for me to write a post where I continuously say it may have been an 'off day' for the chef.

I remember eating here when I was a teenager and really enjoying the food and lunch specials at Amlee Chinese Cuisine. After going to the movies at nearby Galaxy last week we passed by here so, I suggested to hubby that we come back and try this place and see if it was still as good as I remembered. With a fellow yelper in tow we headed for dinner here last night and wasn't disappointed. 4.5 stars!

Walking in we were greeted and taken to our seats. Water and menus were brought right to our table right away. We shared ""family style"" and picked out somethings we all like. Food is brought out on a cart and served to you. 

Fried Wontons ($5.95) - These came 12 per order and I liked them. Light, yet crunchy with a small bit of chicken in the center. It came with a sweet and sour and spicy mustard dipping sauces. 

Szechuan Chicken Salad ($10.95) - Yum! The salad was tossed in front of us. The portion was huge and there was plenty to go around. I really liked the flavor of the dressing best and the fresh carrots stood out.

Vegetable Fried Rice ($8.95) - I felt there could have been a little more flavor in this dish. The size was perfect especially if sharing, but the carrot and peas didn't really stand out flavor-wise. The rice was cooked just right though.

Szechuan Beef ($16.95) - So good! The beef was so tender and the whole dish together just tasted great. The huge fresh mushrooms were tasty.

Orange slices were brought to each of us at the end of the meal. I felt the charge of $3.95 for a soda was steep. Free refills, but almost the price of an appetizer. The service was great and we left full and pleased! The owner stopped to talk to us for a moment and she's genuinely passionate about the type of food they are putting out as well the type of service they provide.

They offer delivery so call to check the areas they cover. You can also place your order for pick-up if you don't want to dine inside. They have lunch specials that range in price from $7.95, $8.95, $9.95 and $10.95 depending on what you order and it includes soup, egg roll and choice of steamed or egg fried rice.",4

We ordered family style: vegetable and shrimp, orange peel chicken, fried shrimp, and pork fried rice. Everything was delicious. The orange peel chicken was not too sweet and not spicy (unless you happen to eat one of the red peppers). We went in at 9pm on a Thursday (they close at 10pm) and we experienced very speedy and quality service. 

We were given complimentary orange slices with our fortune cookies which was a special treat. We will definitely come back.",5
162348,Awtpg2tklJFLpdrTSdALxw,w9KBaltlg7B_tca-nNfj_A,"I finally found a place to get great Chinese food. I noticed some other reviews mentioned this place being too pricey. I don't get that it does say gourmet on the sign out front. Sure the inside is completely dated but it still has class and the owner herself comes to the table to serve each plate. She even prepared the salad we ordered fresh in front of us. The food isn't greasy in anyway which id w hat I find at most places I have been too. The portion of food you get for the price is very good. I would suggest because if the portion sizes that you either plan on sharing with your table or taking leftovers home. Nothing like cold Chinese food for lunch the next day! 

I ordered Szechuan Beef and could have easily eaten the whole dish if I weren't sharing with others because it was that good. The meat was tender and very good. I rarely eat rabbit food but I did think it was cool how it was prepared right in front of us. The vegetable fried rice tasted perfect. My wife thought it could use more flavor but she also likes soy sauce on it so whatever. The service is really awesome here and i left full and satisfied. Coming back for sure.

You get 5 star quality side table service. 

The Mai Tai was so good. Didn't realize how much alcohol they put it in until it crept up on me later. 

Food was fresh and really tasty. 

Shrimp Won Tons- most places serve these with imitation crab and you normally can't find a place to serve good quality won tons anymore. These were crunchy and delicious. Not greasy like in most places.

Chicken Salad with peanuts - this was good but out of the whole meal would be last on my list to reorder. Peanuts were all I could taste. 

Chicken Lettuce wraps- not overpowered by the sauce and crunchy but again would probably put this item second to last. 

The Strawberry chicken brought back good memories. Just as I remember from childhood. It was still crisp outside with it even smothered in strawberry sauce. My fork going through didn't make it turn to mush so good job balancing the crisp outside while you still have plenty of sauce. 

All time favorite is Am Lee Beef!!! Can't describe in words how good. 

My first time eating Generals Chicken and I wasn't disappointed. 

Ambiance is more of the old school feeling. Doesn't seem to have been modernized but at least you get that nostalgia feeling of old times when you go in. It's not falling apart just has that old vibe to it.",5

To be painfully honest,

All three of us were dissatisfied at the price of the dishes.  Don't get me wrong, the food tasted good, but didn't warrant a price tag that exceeds $19 (Orange Chicken, Beef w/Broccoli); even our cups of won ton and egg drop soup were almost $10!
We honestly expected something more than what we were presented with.  We would have had a more tasty and financially satisfying meal at Pei Wei.  Plus, their decor were stuck in 1991.

I tried the Kung Pao Prawns lunch special.  Great portion size and it was delicious! Spicy but not an overpowering spice.  I loved it.  The lunches come with soup, white or fried rice and an egg roll.

  Money talks. When I  spend money I talk about it on Yelp. In the next few paragraphs I will talk about my lunch in Amlee Chinese Cuisine. 

 In recent times I have been trying out the different Chinese restaurants in the Las Vegas Valley. After visiting Amy's Hallmark, I decided to try Amlee Chinese Cuisine near my house. 

 Amlee Chinese Cuisine is located in a small strip mall at the southeast corner of Sunset and Sandhill Roads. From what I read, Amlee Chinese Cuisine has been standing in this exact spot for thirty years. It has been thirty years of family ownership. When a restaurant is in business for thirty years, they rise above it all. In 2003, Amlee Chinese Cuisine rised above it all when the Best of Las Vegas voted it the best Chinese Restaurant in 2003 (www.usmenuguide.com/amleegourmet.htm).

   When I walked inside Amlee Chinese Cuisine at lunchtime, I saw a bar to my right and a spacious dining room to the left. The tables were large and nearly empty at this visit. 

  The personable waitress led me to a table in this comfortable dining room. Soon, she poured the water into a clean glass. Nonetheless I ordered a Coke with my lunch. This is the first Chinese Restaurant that has ever served me Coke from Mexico. So, it was a cosmopolitan lunch with Mexican Coke and Chinese food. 

  The luncheon special attracted me to Amlee Chinese Cuisine. As my fellow Yelpers have stated, the prices here are higher. I can't support the argument that you get what you pay for when I had food of equivalent taste and quality for the same price recently at dinner in China Bistro, NY Chinese Restaurant, and China Tango Bistro. The lunch specials range between $7.95 and $10.95. They include an entre, soup of the day that is expectedly the omnipresent egg drop soup, egg roll, and choice of fried or white rice. For $1.50 extra, they will substitute the soup of the day with wonton soup. With a Coke from Mexico, wonton soup, and tip my lunch special added up to around $17.50.

  I ordered the shrimp chow mein. The personable waitress stated that this is one of her favorites. In my opinion, the wonton soup was my favorite. I could eat it everyday for the rest of my life and not get tired of it. Maybe that's because wonton soup is in my Top 25 Favorite Foods List. The fried rice was a lighter color than I was used to. However, it was delicious. The noodle based shrimp chow mein was also delicious. I appreciated all the vegetables that tasted like onion and cabage mixed in. On the other hand I would of appreciated more than four shrimp. Come to think of it, I would of appreciated it if the meal included crunchy noodles with duck sauce and hot mustard. 

  I have done enough talking about Amlee Chinese Cuisine. In my opinion that is based on experiences dining in Chinese Restaurants, Amlee is a good Chinese Restaurant that I anticipate serving the Las Vegas community in the decades ahead.",3
162358,wsH49P7vu6hdS31lDPuzuw,w9KBaltlg7B_tca-nNfj_A,"If you value the purchase power of a dollar you'll want to skip this place: $4 for a soda, $9 for a mixed drink. We had a table of eight and everyone skipped the high priced beverages, yet our bill still came to $43 per person. I have had better Chinese food at a buffet, the only difference being the buffet has a better selection and you can go there five or six times for the same price. I am very budget conscience and went to enjoy a meal with family, instead felt as though I had been robbed.",1
162359,xovQxIW4o_TpdQksDArbig,w9KBaltlg7B_tca-nNfj_A,"I'll be honest, after reading the reviews for this place, I really, really wanted to love them. The restaurant itself is very clean, inviting, and the staff really sweet. The menu had everything I was looking for on it. I was making a quick stop for lunch before meeting up with someone, figured I had plenty of time.

I placed my order, got some water with lemon in it, and then glanced at my phone - woops - I had miscalculated and was going to be late, especially if I took my time eating! It was totally not their fault, they were on it with the service, it was all on me.

Glad that I hadn't ordered anything more exciting than water, I grabbed my purse and went up to the front counter. I apologized and asked if I could change my order to to-go. She was cool about it. A few minutes later, I had my bagged up lunch and was out the door. I made my appointment in time, and, luckily, it was casual enough that they didn't mind if I whipped out my chopsticks and started munching away.

I had ordered the orange peel chicken. It sounded really good on paper. It tasted like...salt. Honestly, I found nothing really good about it. Nothing really bad, either, just kind of meh, like grocery store Chinese. I had ordered it spicy, and it wasn't. It was just so-so.

Just for the record, when I order ""spicy"" - babes, that means melt my face, curl my hair, steam out my ears spicy. Not just extra salt. Perhaps there was a communication problem?

I gave them three stars (rounded up from 2-1/2, which isn't an option) for service and because I'm willing to come back with the hubby to try other things. Based on the other reviews, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and try again. They've been here a long time and I haven't. Maybe we were both having an off day?",3
164581,Jqc-yt5ERARBuOPA-vBDJg,HNmyXUXKSr3JI2yXuU7EMQ,"It's ok I've had better but for the price not bad. Orange chicken was ok, place looked clean, but the resturant was extremely hot inside looks like the had the A/C off",2

164583,QtA0vZKopKqeh7QVsRRNfw,HNmyXUXKSr3JI2yXuU7EMQ,"I also have been coming to this place for many many years with my family. The prices are reasonable, it's close to home, and their menu has really yummy go-to's :-)

Personal recommendations:
- Salt and pepper pork! - not too salty, full of flavor and pretty hefty amount of food for ~$7
- Roasted Duck - I love duck, and I seriously think this duck is close to the best in the planet. It's so moist, not overly drenched in soy sauce, and the skin has an awesome way of staying crispy! It's bomb with white rice
- Schezuan Chicken Salad - standard lettuce salad with wonton crisps and tons of chicken. For dressing, it's a mix of chili peppers and soy sauce, and....while this dish isn't so complicated, and I have doubt that this is actually served in Schezuan, China... It's still really tasty and I do have the occasional cravingzz for it 

On another note, I've slowly been moving towards the vegetarian sides of things, and while this restaurant has some really awesome non-v options, there are only a few solely vegetarian options. Their Schezuan Bean Curd is good but not so special. It's basically just soft tofu in a thick, savory sauce. Last, still no brown rice up in heaaa! #saynotodiabetes",4

We had the beef chow fun and salt/pepper shrimp. The chow fun came with gravy, bit it was savory with bok choy, carrots and baby corn. The shrimp was the right amount of crispand flavor . All the seafood was decently priced , and probably have been the last ten years. Friendly service, tasty food, will save me from always going to chinatown!!",4
164588,4pF_j0vc1Tvl2VfNNXi-1w,HNmyXUXKSr3JI2yXuU7EMQ,"I was looking for a new Chinese place to check out near home and after passing on one because they did not have the dish I was in th mood for, I settled on Diamond China 2.  It was my first visit and I am impressed.  The place does not stand out physically by any means.  Not from the outside anyhow.  When you first walk in it does not seem any better.  The front counter looks like any Chinese take-out place.  Nothing special about it.  But I was quickly greeted and seated in a very friendly manner.  Service with a smile is a truism here.  The dining area is very clean and not in the least bit gimicky like some other Chinese places around town.  This is classy without being gaudy.  The blue floral print on the benches and seats if soothing and comfortable.  It also brightens up the room a bit.

I began looking immediately to the noodle section of the menu.  I wanted chow fun noodles, my new favorite.  Before I found the dry style beef chow fun and decided on that, I was brought a pot of hot tea, a glass of ice water and a bowl of crispy fried noodles with sweet and sour.  It was like they read my mind.  Soon, the waitress came back to take my order.  She asked me if I ever had the dish before and told me a bit about it.  ""Fun with bean sprouts and beef"" and ""True Hong Kong style"" were how the dish was described to me.  I was also assured this was her favorite dish.  Maybe it is and maybe it isn't.  I sure liked it though.  The noodles were not as dried out and chewy as at some other places I have ordered chow fun from.  They were still tender but with that trademark chew of a rice noodle without being like rubber.  The beef was tender and delicious.  Maybe a bit sparse but honestly, with the bean sprouts and green onions mixed in with the noodles, the amount of beef was hardly disappointing.  I still came away full and floating away after a pot of tea and three glasses of water on top of my meal.  

I'll be checking this place out again.  The food is good.  The service is excellent.  And the pricing is about average.",4

I enjoyed the fact that we get free hot tea and fried wontons with sour sauce, that is definitely a good touch.  The food is good at a very reasonable price.

The restaurant looks like an older run down place serving up Americanized Chinese food. The whole time I was sitting inside and reading the menu I felt unsure if I really wanted to eat here but I told myself I should at least try it since I was there. I ordered a beef chow fun to go since it's kind of hard to mess that dish up so I figured I was safe.
 
When my order was ready it was handed to be in a bag where I noticed they didn't provide utensils or chopsticks but I was too lazy to go back in since I was already in the car. Strike 1. When I opened the box I noticed that the portions were way smaller than most other Chinese places while they are charging a full entree price ($8.50-10.00)  for everything including the beef chow fun. Strike 2. The beef was fully cooked but had a weird taste to it and the dish overall just seemed bland. Strike 3. 

I would not recommend this place at all and even Panda Express would be a better choice since their food has more flavor. This place also has a $20 card minimum so bring cash if you're not going to be spending over 20 bucks, which I'm sure is not hard to do here.",2

When I got home, I opened my box to find literally chow mein noodles. No sauce, no veggies, nothing on the noodles. They basically boiled the noodles in water then placed in the box. Okay.... so I went back today. Got the lunch special. The chicken with mixed vegetables was good, but only the vegetables. The chicken was soggy and slimy and just not good. The fried rice was fried rice with egg. No vegetables. The service is also really strange and awkward. Time to find a new restaurant.",1

I like that I can grab something to eat while getting a few items at the store. It just is convenient without having to then make another stop for food. I have to say the employees here are awesome. Well, the manager this last time was having lunch and talking with someone (maybe having a meeting?) while this girl was hustling to take care of the orders. I questioned how long something has been sitting out and she offered to make it fresh if I didn't mind waiting. Of course not! I can't believe how this girl was working so hard to take care of the customers and offering to make me fresh food while the manager laughed away in her conversation only a couple feet from me. She should have excused herself and pitched in for a moment. I took the time to tell the girl helping me that she was a hard worker and that I appreciated her service. I only wish I caught her name to give her a shout-out in this review. 

I like to get the 2 or 3 item combo. I always choose fried rice because I find their chow mein to have too many veggies vs. noodles and the noodles are kind of dry. The Firecracker Chicken had good flavor. It isn't very spicy but has a nice baby kick. I tried Beijing Beef and it was sweet and spicy and my favorite of all I ate.  For my 3rd item I got Honey Walnut Shrimp and it was sweet, crispy, and good. The Cream Cheese Rangoons are a nice snack on the way home and aren't greasy.

There was only 1 egg roll (even though they are supposed to be sold it sets of 2), no wantons and the orange chicken looked like it was made in the morning.

But for those like me who visit Las Vegas from time to time, this is a hidden gem in the heart of Las Vegas. The one thing, they might need to work on is a bigger bathroom and maybe a little re-model inside. But, the food is mamma-mia good! Another few things that might need to be worked on is dessert options, and maybe have Thai Ice Tea or Milk Ice Tea? That would give options for us who just want to drink something other than tea? Yet, this restaurant hasn't steered us wrong yet. I think the favorite dish of mine is the frog legs. My dad loves the beef with bitter melon. All this restaurant needs is to re-vamp itself with some renovations or remodeling. Otherwise, food is great. I would definitely order the frog legs, sweet and sour pork, and steamed rice. Don't order water, order tea! the best thing about a chinese restaurant is its tea. Although they do not serve dim sum, this is definitely a great place if you need some really good Chinese Food. Keep up the good work you guys!",5
168303,KgpHSyxQzo3oZkRpFubhdQ,1MJ5xmHmeCiau07X2bQyUQ,"I had lunch with my BFF Lily L. and her mother a couple weeks ago. I was really excited to hear that this was her family's favorite Chinese restaurant, not knowing that she makes it a point to dine here every time she's in Vegas!

Of course, I left all the ordering to Lily and her mom and they picked their favorites. We had Steamed Fish, Tofu with Bamboo Fungus and Chinese Broccoli, Salt and Pepper Squid, and Steamed Fish in Black Bean Sauce. Everything was really delicious!

I'm not sure what type of fish was used in our dishes (the menus are not very descriptive in English and there was a lot of Mandarin flying around), but it may have been catfish and sole according to Lily's mom. They were both tasty and picked up the sauces really well. The S&P squid was not my favorite rendition of this favorite dish, but still tasty. Now, the tofu dish really surprised me. I normally dislike fried tofu because it's dry and just gross, however, this tofu was perfectly fried with an insanely creamy texture inside! That paired with the sauce, Chinese broccoli, and bamboo fungus, major YUM! **Side note: the menu says bamboo, but that's deceiving. It's actually a type of mushroom called Bamboo Fungus. Rich in protein, dietary fiber, and carbohydrates; also used in Chinese medicine (thank you Wikipedia). Very interesting specimen!**

During lunch, prices are very, very reasonable. A bargain. Also, if you dine with 4+ people for dinner, you're given a complimentary roasted chicken! If that isn't incentive enough to dine here! The service was just okay. We finished all our food before we received our final dish that was ordered at the same time as the others and forget water refills. They were really overwhelmed and apparently there was only 1-2 cooks with an almost full dining room. Fortunately, the food and prices will bring me back and hopefully they aren't as busy.",4

We were never asked if we wanted a refill and our glasses sat empty since before the food came out. The table that sat down and ordered 10 minutes after we sat down and ordered had their 4-5 dishes come out long before our 2 dishes. We had Mongolian Beef and Steamed Pork & Salted Fish. The Mongolian Beef was pretty tasteless and came out 10 minutes before the pork. The pork tasted just like spam.

The day that I was in the restaurant, me and my friend were some of the only people there--meaning, the service that we received was great!!! Our waitress was friendly and always checking up on us. She was even pretty fast with our bill!

The place was packed with nothing but Chinese people, good sign I thought. Very average Chinese food if you ask me. The portion control kind of sucked on some dishes, too little meat and too much fillers like veggies. A few dishes were good but nothing stellar. My favorite by far was the deep fried pork chops. Not too bready or fatty, nice portions and great authentic taste. The beef chow fun while tasted good again had way too many sprouts and onions. The place again was packed and very cramped so get ready to be bumped and pushed while you're eating. Las Vegas Chinatown has some really fantastic Asian food, I have yet to have a bad meal there.

Free delicious soup after you place your order! I would actually pay to get the soup since it's that delicious. I didn't taste much of MSG which is always a plus at Chinese restaurants!,5
168317,F3TsSOyInRs63MmtAJvptw,1MJ5xmHmeCiau07X2bQyUQ,"Upon reading the reviews on Yelp, I decided to bring my parents here for lunch when we arrived in Vegas the first day - my parents are the type that only likes to eat Asian food - actually Chinese food to be exact and so I was obliged to find a good Chinese place in Vegas. It was about 2pm when I got here and they were still busy so I took it as a good sign.

However, it didn't quite live up to what I expected.. I didn't have that high of expectations to begin with since I know we are in Vegas and it's not like they are known for Chinese food...but I didn't expect that poor of quality either.

To begin with - the service was okay - I mean I didn't expect much from an Asian place - and they only had like two waitress/waiter and it was busy - so you can imagine that they would forget to bring you things you asked for until you asked about 7-8 times. 

The food was ehhh - I was kind of disappointed because on their online menu they offered Deer meat but they didn't have that on their menu when we got there - only the ordinary stuff - I really did wanted to try Deer meat with mushroom and sacha sauce but they didn't have any dish that offered deer meat so not sure what that's about.

So instead we order three dishes: Salt and pepper fried shrimp, clay pot chicken and pork crispy chow mein noodles. 

The salt and pepper fried shrimp was small and over-fried. The clay pot chicken - didn't have a lot of chicken and the chicken was chopped up in very little pieces it was difficult to eat - there was more mushrooms than chicken. The only dish I thought was fairly decent was the pork crispy chow mein noodles - but then again it wasn't very crispy - they slathered the sauce all over it so it became soggy instead but at least the flavor was okay.

Overall, I don't think that I would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that I silently felt too.",2

I had tried a number of restaurants in the Vegas Chinatown area and wasn't really impressed, but KJ Kitchen was an exception, and by far the best Chinese food I've had in the area. 

There's a bit of a wait usually if you come for dinner, but the food is worth it. I've come here a couple of times with big parties and we're always left satisfied. Mainly Chinese customers, and the portions are big and prices reasonable. One of the best things on the menu is the roasted duck. The skin is always crispy and the meat isn't dry at all. In fact, my local friend comes here almost every week and orders the duck. The salt and pepper pork chops, mu shu pork, sitr fried noodles, sichuan style green beans, and a lot of the seafood dishes are always money. I haven't tried everything on the menu but it seems like it's hard to go wrong with anything here.

Braised Pork Belly w/ Pickled Vegetable - very good.  Not too fatty or salty.  Good amount of pork meat to fat.  (although i love more fat, but i know it's bad for me)
Oysters w/ Green Scallions in Sizzling Pot - Good.  A big greasy tho.  But very tasty.  Never had a dish like this before, so I liked it.
Mixed Seafood w/ Vegetables - Good amount of seafood.  Good!
Sauteed Green Beans w/ Minced Pork - Good also.  First dish to be eaten up completely clean.
Roast Duck - Not bad.  For a restaurant that doesn't have ducks hanging in the window, it was decent.  A bit fatty, but still good flavor and not too salty.
Fish Stomach Soup - Good also.  We started out with this.  Good amount of fish.
Sweet n Sour Pork Chops - I love this dish, I always get it everywhere I go.  It's such an ABC americanized dish, but it brings back my childhood memories.  This place made it good.  Not too bready, not too fatty.  Not too sweet.

Honey walnut shrimp - it was crispy and smothered in mayo sauce making it ultra creamy. Yet, I think it was missing something. It felt very one noted in the flavor department and I felt overall that it needed more seasoning to bring it all together. It's certainly not the best honey walnut shrimp I've ever had, but it passes as good. 4/5

Vegetable egg-rolls - don't try ordering these! I ate one and it tasted like dish water. The filling was extremely sad and there was nothing stuffed inside the rolls except for cabbage and maybe carrots? Whatever it was, it disintegrated from the deep frying, making it barely noticeable and mush. Also the sweet and sour sauce to dip was watery and tasted off. Very disappointing and not worth getting. 1/5

Salt & Pepper Shrimp:   Pretty traditional Chinese dish.  Good flavor, the shrimp were rather small but then again, it was a lunch special.

Sweet & Sour Pork Chop:  This dish fell flat.  Mostly bones or fat.  Too much breading and too greasy.  Avoid this item.

Our first dish came with a LONG HAIR chilling on the side of the plate. It was so noticeable that I saw the hair when they were bringing our dish over.  That is just RUDE that they were too lazy to wipe it off. The server watched me pick out the hair and didnt say anything. I was contemplating about taking a picture of the hair but I was afraid they would spit in my food. Nice first impression.

In an effort not to sound completely inappropriate I'll say this. I usually go toe ""ethnic"" places where the people of that particular ethnicity frequent.

168334,FqV2zTRS9lt9lZpVOTgGvw,1MJ5xmHmeCiau07X2bQyUQ,Not good at all. I had to add soy and spice just to make the Fuk-Jin Seafood fried rice edible. Looked like a $14 TV dinner and had chicken in place of most of the seafood. Strangely the menu didn't mention chicken. I had to ask for the included dessert. I guess I didn't spend enough for my $14 fried rice! I will not be back and you would be wise to try some of the great Chinese restaurants in the area.,1
168335,HbAU_AW6bzKCsCDfOFjq6w,1MJ5xmHmeCiau07X2bQyUQ,"Loved the Peking Duck, wonderful flavor and they do an excellent table service. I had to ask for napkins and rice both times I've gone, waitstaff is pretty inattentive. Got the Kung Pao Chicken the second time and it gave me a pretty severe case of upset stomach ... but the duck was so good I'd go back. The tea was tasty.

What I would consider traditional Chinese atmosphere, they put me next to the water feature when I was dining alone. Incredible amount of white noise, would probably not be good for parties unless you are making some kind of mobster deal.",4
168336,pt7bhsexgPWZYhIBaWJZ6A,1MJ5xmHmeCiau07X2bQyUQ,"Solid authentic Chinese food- expect to see lots of families dining together at giant tables heaped with giant portions of fresh food, twirling around on lazy susans. Service is not the most attentive but genuine and polite, food is fresh and great.

Menu is extensive and a bit more expensive than you might expect- but the quality is the reason why, hence my use of the word authentic. Also, portions are enormous. Many seafood dishes including sea cucumber, lobster, and crab. Some dim sum-like items on the appetizer menu, including my favorite fried shrimp balls, but here they go for larger portions with a justifiably higher price tag (order of 8 for $13).

Getting a few dishes to share family-style is the way to go here: Szechuan scallops are stir fried with onions, bell pepper, and bamboo, and is a great dish here. Another favorite is the barbeque duck, which is available at a well-priced $9 for the half order and is served with an amazing sauce.",3

Attentive as you might get in a ""nicer"" place, but not bad.  I didn't care for the pan fried pot stickers, which were barely fried at all.

I had a yen for wonton soup after driving six hours from Tehachapi; looking for soothing comfort food. The Wor Won Ton was filled with beef, & satisfied but I wish they added some chestnuts (for crispness) and some shrimp & pork. As an
Asian kid I remember fondly how great this combo tasted in LA Chinatown. Still, for a restaurant that stays open until 2 am the quality of my soup tasted wonderful. Previously I ate at The Rio & both serve dim sum. The Rio serves dim sum into the evening, KJ Kitchen stops in the afternoon. There is always a higher ratio of Asians to mainstream America. This is my visual test for good Chinese food. Sort of seeing lots of trucks parked in parking lot along I -5 in the boonies. My night waiter was very friendly. His name is ""Long"" an older gentleman, crew cut. I took an appetizer of salted chicken wings back to my Best Western room. The honey walnut shrimp looked great, FYI.

If you just want to get stuffed for cheap, this is your spot!  It's relatively cheap, especially at lunch time.  Nothing here specifically stands out as it's more or less typical Chinese/Japanese fare.  The good thing is that because there's such high turnover of food, you're usually getting some pretty fresh vegetables.  There's also a Mongolian BBQ option if you want it, although it's pretty meh compared to a dedicated Mongolian BBQ place.  

If you like Asian good and you're trying to eat way too much in one day to cover your meals for the entire day (like ME), then this is where to go!  Don't expect much more than that though.",3

There's some more specialty items here like a larger sushi bar, fresh stirfry, sometimes tritip, and tempura. And there are the typical asian buffet fair.

One star off for bad service--half the time the servers flounder. And the building layout sucks.
Another star off for some of their food is just lacking, or seems a bit ""watered down"". 

I like to go here when I get tired of other asian buffets in the area. Try coming here as it opens as the food is fresher and sometimes there's dishes that are only laid out once. If you don't want to take the risk, try Krazy Buffet up the road.",3

I had told myself, before I bring my mom here, she considers herself Chinese Food Buffet Connoisseur so I had to scope it out. hmm...EPIC FAIL, not impressed, actually disappointed.

I hate wasting money, and to me this was a waste of money.  Saturday, dinner time, it was packed in there, there was a 15min wait to be seated. It was just me and my 3yr old nephew, yet they called out and seated numbers that were after us. (They lose an entire STAR for that tacky sh!t right, a potential 4STAR rating is still achievable right? NO, HELLS NAH)

We were finally seated, I promise it looked like a feeding frenzy in there.  I'm a sushi fan, it just looked very contaminated, people breathing over it, no please make my Sushi in front of me Thank You much.  This buffet over somewhat of a variety of dishes, but standard Chinese buffet fare.  You know the staples: orange chicken, beef broccoli, chow mien, egg drop soup, pizza, etc, etc.

Empty tins w/ no food, granted it was busy in there and maybe they could not keep up with the demand but when they did food did come out it was enough for like 5 people.  Some dished were piping hot and others were luke warm.  I'll just comment on the items I DID eat:

Orange Chicken: ok, I didn't eat this but I had to comment on this, Orange Chicken is my go to  item when I go to these type of buffet. Um, Orange Chicken is not suppose to be SOUPY.  I cannot make this up, it looked like orange chicken soup, NO BUENO.

Chow Mien: hmm, greasy, no crunch to the veggies

Baked Mussel: it was ok, mussels were minced with some kind of cream cheese and melted cheddar cheese on top

Fried Butterfly Shrimp: can't go wrong with this, its boxed shrimp, yum yum good :-)

Green Beans: greens beans are my fav, um yea they were greasy too and limp, no snap

Peppered Chicken: that was decent, but the jalapenos took over my pallet so I had to pick around it

Crab Ragoons and Egg Rolls: once again you cannot go wrong w/ fried foods

Pot Stickers: dough was gummy, at the edges it was hard as if they had been sitting out for a long time

Pizza: this is my little dudes favorite, he can eat 3 regular slices...he ate 1 slice and picked at the other slice

Sweet and Sour Chicken: no need for the sauce because the chicken was hard as HELL, another item  that had been sitting out way too long.  needles to say that was not consumed

Friend Chicken Wings: I didn't eat them, but my kid enjoyed them.  I'll say it again,  you cannot go wrong w/ fried foods

the SERVICE: BAD enough said (-2STARS for bad service)

Overall, food was not even So-So, I've had better, HELL - we've ALL had better. $25.97 for $5.00 buffet food.  I'm so done

So, we will not be back to this establishment, and I will take my mom ""The Chinese Food Buffer Connoisseur"" somewhere else.  I've had better, there IS better in the valley, but this is only my opinion, try it out for yourself and see how you like it.",2
170553,7hBlX4AwgU38JKNcZF8kaQ,ME0olHUKPsJ9spaLudZlYA,"I've been here about three times the past month, and I'm glad to say that they've stepped up their service. They're no longer rude - they're actually really nice here now! We asked to sit in a different place, and the hostess smiled and was okay with that. The servers take the plates off the table must faster, and they don't neglect you anymore! Yaaay to not be neglected!!! 

Food is still food. It's a Chinese buffet. You get what you pay for, and you can't really complain. This is NOT a luxury casino buffet, this is a buffet off the strip. So if you're expecting some gourmet Chinese food, this place is not for you! You'll have the usual mediocre sushi bar, the cream cheese wontons, cream cheese baked green mussels (YUM!), etc etc etc. I like the food here, so I don't have anything to complain about. 

I'm definitely coming back here! This place has gotten better, and my tummy (and family) has left happy each time!

P.S. Refillable drinks (includ. Thai Tea) is 0.95 more! WORTH IT, in my opinion!",3

Noodles were plain, orange chicken was just fried pieces of dried chicken in some brown goop. Very simplistic dishes that they somehow manage to mess up. The only thing worth eating were the pre made deserts that came out of a box. The establishment itself, it is very cluttered and disorganized. Sure it's $8 a person but you're going to get what you pay for, you're better off getting frozen Chinese for $4 from the grocery store. Drive the extra 5 min and just go to Chinatown. And to top all of that, the wait staff is just as bad. There was an elderly person that can't walk very fast in my party and before I could get out of the booth they had come to flip the table and bumped her out of the way just about knocking her over. That is  unacceptable!  I get you are trying to get people in and out like cattle but at the risk of your customers safety?!  If I could give negative stars I could.",1

170558,8_IVojNKfoow8UyvH12G_g,ME0olHUKPsJ9spaLudZlYA,"So once every few years I think to myself ""hey maybe I should go to a cheap Chinese buffet"" and then more often than not I regret my decision. This time was no different. Despite the reviews on Yelp this place got Best of Las Vegas (at least if my memory serves me right) so we decided to try it. It was at a premium price, for this place, around $16 for the weekend seafood buffet. We went on Saturday night, no wait but extremely busy. Service was poor, I had to track someone down when I wanted a drink refill and in the middle of dinner they took my soy sauce away. I thought to fill it or exchange and bring it back, but no it was just gone.  They had less selection of Chinese food than I expected, maybe because there was more seafood. A lot of people were eating the snow crab, but that is just way too much work for me for so little reward, I am a king crab or nothing kind of girl unless it is already cracked open. They also had salt and pepper frog legs, which was different, although I didn't try it. The only thing that I liked was some sort of seafood medly on a shell with a baked on mayonnaise sauce. I recently saw a poster that bacon was the duct tape of food, and if that is so I think mayonnaise is like the glue - it helps quite a bit to repair food that would otherwise lack in flavor. They had a small sushi bar, and it was well meh - I guess I should be thankful there was any sushi, and there were a few different kinds - tako, salmon, tuna, eel, a number of norimaki rolls. The rolls were okay. Also, I tried the white fish but I wasn't sure what type of white fish it was, maybe Tilapia, but it really wasn't that good. They had salt and pepper squid, which again was okay.  So yes - overall I would say, some items were okay at best but I won't ever be coming back.",2

Overall it's just ok , the crab legs are so skinny I think they were on a diet before the got cooker lol. The upside is they are pretty cheap if you are hungry for inexpensive food that is so so in my book.  I like Krazy Buffet better and their crab legs are much more plumped.

They have this rule that if you come in and pay during lunch, you can only eat the food that's out for lunch. Once the time for dinner hits you can't eat the foods that are labeled ""dinner only."" That pretty munched suck. 

But being the ""rebel"" I am I went ahead and took frog legs out of the dinner portion. They were probably the best thing I ate at the buffet.

Good Chinese food. Decent price. Great selection. Better than most Asian buffets. About $9 for lunch, not including drinks. Prices for dinner differ on weekends. Your food will be hot and seasoned well. The sushi bar is just a decent alternative to Chinese food.  Nothing spectacular about the sushi. This place is always busy so food is constantly coming out. Teriyaki chicken, steamed gingered fish, and potstickers are my favorite. As for service, the employees seem to be working themselves to the bone, especially during lunch and dinner hours.

Note: this place is often packed! Wait time especially on the weekends can be 20 minutes or more. Lunch will not include crabs. Lobster tails will only be included on the dinner weekend menu. Prices change during dinner and weekends will be more.

Dinner (weekend) - My husband likes it because the price is reasonable for AYCE. He likes the snow crabs, and the salt and pepper dungeness crabs. He also likes the frog legs, buttered shrimp, Manila clams, oysters, oxtail soup, tomyun, and Mongolian barbecue. I find the food salty for my taste. I eat the lobster tails (you have to elbow your way to the lobster tail area or stand and wait for a new batch which comes in every 15 to 20 minutes) and sushi but secretly throw away the rice (and yes...I feel guilty thinking of the many hungry people but my stomach cannot tolerate too much rice). Their desserts consist of cheap cakes and pastry, jello, jell and cookies. Fruits are typical:  cantaloupe, grapes, watermelon and canned fruits.

170568,5Tln5qQTaZ90S6BkT9BseQ,ME0olHUKPsJ9spaLudZlYA,"For most Angelinos, Las Vegas is a little like the playground that's just a few blocks away.  More and more the Las Vegas strip is going Asian.

Besides the typical China Star Buffet located on the central strip, there are dozens of other oriental options to choose from in Vegas, on and off the strip. To reach the Chinese area travel west of the strip on the street called Spring Mountain, between Sahara and Flamingo. The banquet begins just a few blocks from the casinos. There are Chinese seafood restaurants, Dim Sum places, Malaysian, Vietnamese, Korean and even some full fledged Chinese grocery stores, up and down the street. But one of the things I always keep my open for when it comes to Las Vegas, are buffets. And my absolute favorite find was Buffet Asia, a ten minute drive west of Chinatown, just off Sahara on Pleasant Street.

For three days we asked the local Chinese what the best place in town was and uniformly they recommended this place. I was skeptical at first, for one; because in my experience the best Chinese restaurants are never outside of the Chinese area, and two, the name was suspiciously non Chinese (the best places always have weird translations like ABC Seafood). But Buffet Asia was the real thing. The buffet set us back about $15 for adults and half that for kids on a Saturday night, this place was well worth it, starting with a well stocked sushi table, abundant in tuna, salmon, clam and eel sushi plus some very creative rolls. Following that are the soups (wonton, miso, hot & sour, and egg drop corn), not as good as made-to-order but for a buffet they were excellent. But don't fill up on those items because next comes the many traditional main dishes, like snow crab legs (both steamed and fried in garlic), orange chicken, sweet and sour shrimp, oysters, frogs legs, spicy green beans, Chinese vegetables in sauce and many more. My favorites were the clams in black bean, the soy sauce fish, and the lobster in supreme sauce. By the time I was done with all that I was stuffed, and I hadn't even gone to the Mongolian barbeque yet, which offered fresh (not frozen) meats and seafood including thick cut Korean style short ribs, squid steaks, and fresh shrimp. Tea, non-alcoholic drinks, and dessert are included in the price.

So if you are tired of the same old food in Las Vegas and you don't want to break the pattern by breaking the bank at one of the name restaurants on the strip, then I recommend a trip into the interior to check out the local Chinese fare. It turned out to be a real treat for me.",4
170569,6TD7LmEZcK4Lxe5LqtX-VQ,ME0olHUKPsJ9spaLudZlYA,"TLDR: sodas/tea not free; to-go available; ample seating; no charge for leftovers

This Buffet @ Asia location reflects the hard work of employees in making this location safe for the public. Make no mistake: not all locations are the same. Be wary of the other ones!

The service up front and table side is pleasant. You must pay prior to seating and no refunds are made once the transaction has completed. A gratuity is charged for parties over 8, but they check waters often enough and the waiters/servers never stop moving. 

The food is par and not over the top. There isn't a flavor that stands out and it's pretty standard. It's what you expect at any Asian buffet place. Panda's express makes this location seem sub-par, but I'm sure others might frown upon my opinion. 

Drinks are not free. They cost $0.95 which is not a bad deal, but maybe you might want it for the Chinese tea. The restaurant also has a sushi bar and soft serve machine. The rice is too vinegary, but that probably means it's safe at any temperature.",3

The sticky rice was great paired it with some bachali koora (Chinese Spinach) some vegetable potstickers, sweet n sour sauce over the rice, cream cheese won ton, and one piece of orange chicken for a taster.

The lo mein was pretty great, steamed vegetables good amount of garlic and less seasoning, pork and beef skewers were great. 

The sushi wasn't the poorest quality I have ever had and wasn't fantastic but the fact that it's there for so cheap and in abundance at that is pretty kick butt.

The fried octopus was a little chewy probably a result of being held to long in the chaffing dish. I didn't expect greatness from the octopus on a buffet line and should have steered clear but I was interested if they pulled it off.

Dessert was nice I had an espresso cake.

With regards to service, the front counter lady was friendly.  Service was prompt.  They refilled my drink twice very promptly.  Overall very good service.  Your mileage may vary here but we were eating lunch at 11 so all was good.  Lastly, two adult lunch with drinks for less than $20.  Can't beat that as well.  Overall very very good experience.

170575,3ZlitOzx-G6qY8o1a3ZoKQ,ME0olHUKPsJ9spaLudZlYA,"I have some serious reservations about the cleanliness of this place.  Clutter is everywhere, the buffets did not look like they're been recently wiped down. And our table was sticky.  

The selection is not great.  The taste/quality of the food was good.  Service was fast and friendly.  

I don't think I'd go back.",2
170576,qwKko27ufuHitjddWMtuOg,ME0olHUKPsJ9spaLudZlYA,"I went with a group of friends but they did not have a large  table for us so we were all separated into tables for 2 and some into table for 4.  We were all separated and did not get to chat/socialize at all (uh,uh, not bueno at all).  Yet, at the end of the meal, the waitress went around and passed out to each couple a mandatory 18% tip bill. When I asked the waitress why the 18% when they'd refused to sit us together, she said something about "" but ju still a group"".....whatever.

My sister in law got really sick from the food and couldn't enjoy the strip.  She ended up going back home after the dinner instead.  She was having  stomach pain from the food.   :((

170578,cbWHQLlSW4bUWHQy0lMC6g,ME0olHUKPsJ9spaLudZlYA,"This place is fantastic! The food selection is great - lots of things to choose from. The kitchen  staff keeps up with the demand very well; the food is always hot and the pans are always full of food. The service is superb - I usually post a lot about bad service but this buffet gets two thumbs up for service. The best thing about this staff is that they speak English - I don't have to point to things and shake my head here...they understand my needs and respond very well, which is a big plus for me. The price for a Sunday dinner is about $15/person....reasonably low priced for the excellent food and service. We will definitely be coming back!",4
170579,p2fRbWOZ7GenUhdIK-Y3kA,ME0olHUKPsJ9spaLudZlYA,"I have been here a few times before and it is used primarily for a large food intake at a cheap price after a long hike. So that being said I am not expecting the best.

Exterior: The building itself actually looks appealing and in good condition. There is a large parking lot so finding a space is usually not a problem. It's cross streets are Rainbow and Sahara, it is next to a diner which I will try soon.

Interior: When you open the first set of double doors there are a few coin operated toy machines to get your last couple quarters due to the kids nagging. After the second set of double doors you are inside the restaurant, the counter to your left is where you pay and get taken to your table from. The dining area is large and has a couple separate rooms so you don't feel overcrowded. There are 6 food serving areas in the middle of the buffet containing various food items to choose from, there is a long service area containing fruit and desserts with an ice cream machine next to it, there is another long service area containing a good variety of sushi, and lastly there is a grill area for all of your Mongolian bbq to be prepared. I heard there is a bar but I have not seen it.

Food: The food is average with nothing to get excited about but for less than $9 you really can't expect the best or complain. The various dishes in the middle of the buffet are usually hot and switched out regularly. The chow mein, chicken with jalapenos, cream cheese rangoon, and sushi is usually what I stick with. The sushi is actually decent for the price and has a lot of rolls to select. I got a spring roll yesterday and it was extremely greasy. I also got some of the butterfly fried shrimp and they were undercooked. Like I said the food is cheap and I will return when the wallet is light.

Service: The service is actually good. I always get seated quickly considering I always want a booth. The staff never let your drinks go empty and are constantly refilling them. Your finished plates are picked up in a timely manner, sometimes you get a glance if you leave a mountain of food like I have a couple times due to not liking it, but they don't charge you for wasting food so that's ok. 

I give it 3 stars due to the butterfly fried shrimp being undercooked and for waiting for close to 5 mins for the Mongolian bbq cook to show up, he didn't so I ended up leaving a bowl of uncooked food there.",3
170580,wl3HYSqk_F2Y7LH86zLArw,ME0olHUKPsJ9spaLudZlYA,"When you need an all-you-can-eat fix (AYCE F), this place will do it.  Easier than going to a hotel, it's a standalone building with fairly easy parking.  It's cheap, ahem, well-priced.  With Lunch $8.29 & Dinner $12.49 (drinks extra), a little goes a long way.

Influenced by Japanese and Chinese cooking, it has all the goodies you can expect.  A plethora of a selection that includes Sushi, Mussels, Fried Dumplings, BBQ Spareribs, noodles, and salad bar for lunch.  Add to that for dinner: Snow Crab, New Zealand Green Mussels, cocktail shrimp, and a small Mongolian section - yum.

Take it from me whose dined here 5-6 times over the years, it's A-Okay in my book.

The decor is old and doesn't look sanitary.  
Their isn't a huge selection of food and I found the items I picked to be under seasoned and very oily.

There ends the good news.  The food is tasteless and it wasn't fresh. The employees are very rude.  And it is extremely loud in there (maybe because of the tile floors).

We go here at least a dozen times a year. There is a pretty nice selection of food from your typical asian starches to the flavorful meats. My favorite is the beef tenderloins, the oxtail soup, the sauteed shrimp with snow peas, and their ginger lobster. Everything else is pretty decent too. The sushi isn't terrible, but it should definitely NOT be the main focus of your meal.

They have a pretty nice Mongolian station too, they stir fry up fresh veggies, meats, and aromatics into one plate. Get it with extra garlic and spicy!

Service is fast and wonderful, which is VERY refreshing for your typical Asian buffet. The refills are ALWAYS fast, and they actually smile and respond when you thank them. 

I will continue to dine here with family and friends because it's a great spot to hang out for delicious food.

Found it odd that this place also has a full bar? 
Sushi roll offerings at dinnertime are extensive: several special rolls, though they are not labeled, so be prepared to try a lot or be able to identify the types of fish you do/don't like. Some nigiri available, too.
Lots of crab, preference was for the salt and pepper fried Jonah crab claws rather than the typical Alaskan. 

$13/person weeknight dinner is not outrageous, and you can easily get your money's worth here, but this place isn't likely to blow your mind. Service is also what you'd expect for an Asian buffet, no surprises there.",3

Staff helped me load them in my car, upon loading them, I noticed that the trays were the same size and insisted the lady that I ordered one full tray and the other one a half tray.  The lady then was getting impatient and said they use the same trays for a full order or a half tray.  The half tray will just be half of that tray.  So I gave her the benefit of the doubt.  Went home and found out I overpaid.  2 half trays instead of 1 full $35.  The food was just ok.  This is a shady business practice.  Shame on this restaurant.

The food is pretty delicious. Every time I come here I'm not disappointed. My favorites are -- Shrimp wontons & shrimp balls. They serve it with a mayo dipping sauce that is to die for when combined! We also ordered crab in this ginger garlic sauce which had a lot of flavor. 

I gave them 3 stars because I could have taken a nap & the food would have not arrived yet! Even our wonton soup took forever to come out. We were starving! & today we had ordered deep fried chicken and they forgot it when we clearly ordered it.

Having found KJ Seafood and Dim Sum at the Rio a good value for high quality cart service as a packed dining room assured freshly circulating plates throughout our ninety minute stay it was with a group of five that I sat down at Spring Mountain staple Cathay House hoping to further dispel rumors of Sin City's subpar dim sum but with slipshod service and too few patrons even on Saturday at noon the results were, at best, mixed.  Starting at the door where hasty greetings lead us to the back room it would be less that thirty seconds after seating that the blitzkrieg began - baskets and steamers that had clearly been propped against the wall shoved in our faces with several selections requiring an unannounced trip to the kitchen microwave - and kicking off with a trio of steamed options it was only BBQ Pork buns that proved competent as rubbery XLB and Shu Mai skins undermined otherwise juicy contents.  Still frenetic in pace as a $16 lobster special with slippery noodles swimming in ginger found its way to the table alongside a trio of excellent baked pastries it would unfortunately not be long before these gems were lost amidst overly salted garlic smelt and a dry coconut sponge, the duo immediately leaving me parched  as beverage refills lagged.  Admittedly underwhelmed at this point but willing to go one more round it was at long last (actually only 40 minutes) that Cathay House would rally with a strong finish from a duo of kitchen fresh carts - the crispy duck, sticky pork ribs, and supple shrimp balls all piping hot and reference standard leaving me to wonder what could have been had everything else been delivered fresh.",2
171952,cs3pIfdW2YrMvB3nJ0r2NQ,Xnwjo2TUu4AyGdmsxeG7OQ,"This was only the second time I have been to Cathay House. I came for dim sum years ago and didn't have much of a desire to return but I couldn't resist giving them another chance recently.

We arrived around noon and they weren't too busy. I felt rushed to order, even though we kept telling them we wanted to wait for our entire party to be seated. We ordered hot tea and waters all around and then proceeded to order from the carts that came around. 

They pushed the ginger scallion lobster with pasta on us and although a good value at $15.99, it had to be reheated before they served it to us. The lobster was chewy and the noodles felt like total filler, didn't have much flavor and were overcooked. The highlights from our meal were the custard buns and crab balls. The ribs had to be reheated for us before serving which was a turn off.

The rest of the items we ordered weren't very memorable and I wouldn't recommend most, if any, of it. The coconut bun, egg custard, bbq pork buns and smelt were all completely forgettable.

Service was ok, although refills were a little hard to come by for our waters and tea. There are other dim sum places in town I prefer with fresher items, so I don't see myself coming back any time soon.",1

It just comes down to the food and that's where this place delivers. Everything we tried we liked. I'm not an expert on dim sum so I cant comment on each dish individually. We really liked everything. The servers were really nice too. I've been to other places where the servers aren't friendly so that is a plus in my book. So give them a try.,4

Savory dim sum circulated on two steam carts. 
Cart 1: chicken feet, ha gow, steamed bbq pork buns, and rice roll. 
Cart 2: steamed black bean spareribs, siu mai, salty egg yolk bun.
One more cart offered do hua (tofu pudding with ginger syrup). 

Didn't see a fried items/dessert items cart, but we were able to order shrimp stuffed bell pepper, crab claws in shrimp paste, and turnip cakes from a waiter. The restaurant was out of fried taro with pork/mushroom filling (my favorite). All of the items were fine, but no real standouts.

If you go there after 5, and order Dim Sum, it's going to be the old Chinese saying;

""We reheat it, when you want to eat it"".

All you have to do is tell the people pushing the carts which food you want, and they mark it down on your check and give it to you. You can't just take off the food from the cart, they wouldn't be able to write it down on the check if everyone did that. The Chinese ladies seem very friendly and want to let everyone try the food, and the men working are very quick and get the job done.

They are very slow. Only 2 carts running with barely any dim sum. I've never been to a dim sum restaurant where I have to wait 10 minutes for a cart to come by my table. The restaurant isn't even big! 

The restaurant is smart though. They are doing a promotion where it's half off all the dim sum dishes. Hmmm I wonder why?? Because this restaurant is awful. They do this to lure people in and show that there are actually a lot of people.

171971,H7vJE1_JovfhQaZoNPvWjg,Xnwjo2TUu4AyGdmsxeG7OQ,"I love love love Chinese food. I have friends who own a Chinese restaurant in North County (San Diego) -  their food is spectacular, and their customer service is second to none. I've come to expect similar experiences wherever I choose to dine.

However, during a recent trip to Las Vegas, my expectations were, for lack of a better term, pissed on! My friends decided to have dim sum at Cathay House Chinese Cuisine. They claimed that this place served good Chinese food. I've come to decide that they lied to me!

Dining here was an absolute WTF moment for me. For one, the food was subpar. The rolls were not baked fully, and the chicken feet lacked flavor, yet were swimming in suspicious looking sauce. My sweet and sour chicken was neither sweet nor sour - the cook apparently could not be bothered to put sauce on my dish. I will say their noodles were . . . edible, but a little salt would have gone a long way.

The food aside, the piss poor customer service was criminal! Apparently, the staff at Cathay have clearly designated roles from which they would not deviate. Every time I'd ask a food server for something, they'd tell me, rather rudely, ""That's the waiter's job, not mine."" Twice when we asked for more water, we were told everyone at the table already had a glass (did the service staff not notice our glasses were empty? We were in a desert, and needed our hydration!). My favorite WTF moment came when I asked for a fork. I got a baby-sized plastic fork to use instead. Did I fail to mention that any request we made was ""honored"" with dirty looks?

My friends were horrified, I was pissed, and the pennies we left behind as a tip hopefully conveyed our displeasure with Cathay House of Chinese Cuisine. The entire staff (save for the cashiers) need some training in cooking and customer service.",2
171972,sRmKKzadTKk7SiDfvGLEWw,Xnwjo2TUu4AyGdmsxeG7OQ,"Cathay house conveniently offers up dim sum everyday until 5pm (they close at 5pm every day) and we were also informed that specifically on weekdays, their dim sum is offered at special discounted prices.

We arrived at about 3:45pm on a Sunday and the place was pretty empty, except for another table of 3 sitting by us. The server promptly rolled out a steaming cart and we began ordering. There were a few other items that we wanted to order that weren't in the cart, but we were able to easily and quickly place a special order for them. Unfortunately one item came out cold, (radish cake) - I didn't mind flagging her down to ask her if she can warm it up for us, but it is kind of a turn off that it came to us cold.

My favorites:
- Sui Mai was fluffy, tender, moist and very flavorful. Super addicting. 
- BBQ steamed buns (white bao) - lots of bbq pork filling and the white bao buns were soft and fluffy.
- BBQ pork buns (glossy buns) - The filling was very minimal, but it tasted great. Also, the buns were soft and sweet. 
- Fried shrimp balls served with 
sweet mayo came out hot and crispy. They weren't the best, but I still enjoyed them. 
- Chicken feet had good flavor and they were meaty. 

These were edible but not my favorite: 
- Har gow - the clear wrapper was too thick and chewy. The shrimp filling flavor was alright, but it's not my favorite version of har gow. 
- Rice noodles with shrimp - these were dried out and overcooked.
- Radish cake - came out cold, mushy, and oily. Not served with crispy edges like I'm used to. 

Our overall dim sum meal was filling and satisfying. We would return, but only if we are craving dim sum on a random day after 3pm. Other than that, we will continue to make our way out to KJ Dim Sum - they still hold the throne of best dim sum in Vegas!",3
171973,j_W5wy-ZVprx4WnGFnfXeQ,Xnwjo2TUu4AyGdmsxeG7OQ,A very good Chinese restaurant!  One of the best dim sum we have had and the noodles and fries rice was perfect.  Family loved it. If you want good chinese food in Vegas  Cathay house is the place to go.,5

Will never come back!  They need to train their staffs!!! On top of that they are dirty!
We just ask simple things like refill water, ask for utensils, unacceptable service!!!",1

171976,oAgIPvjW1pbbjYRznkdDdA,Xnwjo2TUu4AyGdmsxeG7OQ,"Very average and greasy Dim Sum in a very loud and disorganized atmosphere. Cart ladies were hard to flag down. Plate of noodles we ordered were taken back to kitchen to be microwaved.  We also tried their Xiao long bao -- Shanghai soup noodles -- and instead of being filled with ground pork, they were filled with some mysterious gray paste that was inedible and nasty.   We left kind of creeped out and pledged not to return.",1
171977,jPhwOSbUGYAmOH9TJ2b6nw,Xnwjo2TUu4AyGdmsxeG7OQ,We always like going to this restaurant when we visit the town .We were seated promptly . Service was good .Their roast pork was nice and crunchy and the meat was lean . Their pork buns could have used a little more sauce. Their shrimp balls were excellent . Hard gow was also good . We had their rice porridge which was flavorful.,4
171978,yiVLsD4Ve60Q9-_wHRuJaA,Xnwjo2TUu4AyGdmsxeG7OQ,"Alright, I am a huge fan of the food but the place scares me a little after finding it on news channel 13.  I know places in Chinatown are always getting hit and they usually clean up their act but sometimes entropy kicks in and you're risking it. I'm trying to focus on the food here.

I went for dinner during the week and during dim sum on the weekends.  I prefer this place during dim sum, it is a huge 180.  They are kind enough to let your order off the menu if you have weekend favorites and it's like Tuesday night, which is very nice.  We got their roast duck, calamari, Chinese greens in oyster sauce, and the crispy pork. OMG that crispy pork and dipping sauce, I can't remember what the sauce was but it was good.. and the pork! Crispy skin on the outside, juicy and tender on the inside.  Great family dinner.  I just hope this place stays clean, if I weren't a little scared I would have given it another star.",3
171979,myNjX3ZfpQbx9f9TmN8scA,Xnwjo2TUu4AyGdmsxeG7OQ,"I was a little scared coming here after seeing them on Dirty Dining. But whatever the whole Chinatown been on that segment.

So I came here around 1 am and it was completely empty. The guy sat us down and gave us menu. I spoke to him in Chinese and he was nice enough to give us the dim sum menus. We ordered steamed pork buns, chicken feet, shui mui, Crispy pork, walnut shrimp, Hong Kong style chow mein, and salt and pepper shrimp. 

Everything was good but just salty and I bet plenty of MSG. Well I mean what do you expect from a late night Chinese food place like this.

Overall service could be a lot better and food is alright.",3
171980,uuha6HevjDiWtzk3bRqotA,Xnwjo2TUu4AyGdmsxeG7OQ,The best dim sum I have had in Las Vegas and I am not a big fan of the type of food. In the restaurant they bring the cart around that is loaded with all types of different dishes and you select what you like based on how it looks.  I was good at eyeing the flavorful - it was all very good!,4

Bathroom...typical Chinese dim sum restaurant. The food's good! not bad and not amazing. We only had the dim sum we didn't get to try the entrees but we saw other customers had ordered them and it looked bomb! We were satisfied :) price is fair and service was excellent!,3

Another thing, once they open again for business you need to bring some earplugs because the place is so noisy from customers shouting and loud talking even with the food in their mouth. I am not going back there anymore to eat.",1
171985,Dnka8PdVSKuwa3NIXzAp1w,Xnwjo2TUu4AyGdmsxeG7OQ,I ate here on a Saturday afternoon with a friend and it was so much fun. The people in this place were very friendly and we felt really welcomed. That really goes a long way since we Americans are a minority here in Chinatown and not always made to feel welcomed. My favorite dish was the shrimp balls...yummy !!  I can't wait to return !,4

There are quite a lot of variaties. And the food is not bad at all. It might not be as good as some places in LA. But I think the  food is pretty decent. Service is okay. It is worth to give it a try.",3
171989,WbCKBSB_fDMEJyLSnRcIrA,Xnwjo2TUu4AyGdmsxeG7OQ,"This place is a joke. It use to be way better until they changed ownership. I wouldn't recommend anyone to go here. 

I went there with my family. Honestly we were sat down and asked what we wanted to drink, all we wanted was water.  It took 20 min and me asking again for our water. They never even gave me a menu when I asked for one. So we left. Absolutely shut this place down doesn't deserve be open.",1

We will be back and we are looking forward to trying the delivery.",4

Since my first order, I've had no complaints (other than when they ran out of my drink :( ) But otherwise, all blue skies!! It took a while to get my past order, but no complaints. The food tastes amazing and authentic. And in my recent order, they even added an extra egg roll, a crab rangoon, egg drop soup, and another fortune cookie! Talk about good fortune!
How awesome are these guys?
Pretty dang awesometastic!

Keep it up,

173006,p7cdAuJrYWR-vRF5GnlixQ,RKI9xvPSuI6mWXMjfdnjXw,Delicious.....definitely a hidden gem. They really should move closer to the strip. Tourist it's worth the drive :-),5

We got Orange chicken (enough for 3 people)  an order of Lo Mein (again, enough for 3 people)  Egg flower soup, fried rice (yup, enough for 3) egg rolls.......And every single thing was so tasty.  It all tasted so fresh and it arrived hot and ready to eat...which we sure did.  So the 3 of us ate and had left overs for $25.  

Oh and Eat 24 said delivery would take about an hour, but it arrived in 30 minutes.

I am glad we did because the service, delivery and food was Outstanding! 

We ordered crab rangoons, war won ton soup, honey walnut shrimp, orange chicken, beef and broccoli, and house special chicken.

The food was very hot and fresh upon delivery which was Fantastic, they don't mess around with delivery. lol

My favorite is their wonton soup, seriously best soup ever!!! The way they make it is delicious and warms my stomach, especially on my sick days.

Really nice girl takes phone orders .  Delivery driver quicker than their eta usually.  But overall  fair-good.  We order from there often (mostly due to lack of options ) but more often than not are pleased when we do.,3

Egg rolls are more like spring rolls and I don't really care much for them.  Their Egg Foo Yung is decent enough, but can be a bit greasy.  Prices are average I suppose for carry-out Chinese.  Not great, but definitely good.  Be sure to add your coupon if ordering online because they WILL NOT offer it to you over the phone.  :)",3

They had online ordering/menu available, but turned it off.  When you ask the woman at the restaurant she tells you to just call in your order.  Problem is that you can tell her you'll be there in 10 minutes and they don't start the food until you arrive.  Kind of defeats the purpose of calling ahead.  Grumpy service = loss of customers = loss of $.  If the service isn't good it doesn't matter how good the food is for us.  We will be shopping around the area now for a new 'regular' Chinese take-out restaurant.  What a shame!",1

286757,PuIwwfEmcoha07hufiFm2Q,7VDrYNPhDKFURZbK4MRi8w,"This review is going off of a catered event from Red Shrimp we had recently at work.

I've heard up and down reviews about Red Shrimp.  The reason my work went with this place for our luncheon was because of their ad placed in one of the local papers.  It had coupons for some extras with qualifying orders.  I'm guessing we got a decent deal for the food to feed 60+ folks.

The food from Red Shrimp however?  Kinda MEH.  Very MEH.  Not my favorite type of hole-in-the-wall Chinese food that I like.  Maybe it was in the execution?  Maybe it was because it was delivered and not eaten at the restaurant?  It just wasn't that great to me.  The food from Panda Express I think I even like more.

Here's the dealio:

-The lo mein was OILY.  Like greasy.  Greasier than usual.  Very slick going down, not yummy.

-The egg rolls were pretty basic.  Possibly store bought and just fried.  But damn was the ginger strong in them.

-The beef broccoli was average.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't stellar either.  It's what you find at any Chinese restaurant here.

-The sweet sour pork was hard!  Might have been overfried or stood too long before serving.  There were bits of pork in there that were difficult to chew.  Taste was ok, but damn did I have a lot of onions to go through.

-Main saving grace was the chicken fried rice.  This was the best thing on my plate(s).  That in itself was pretty yummy, but how hard is it to mess up fried rice??

If we were to have our work luncheon catered again by Chinese, we would probably decide to go somewhere else.  The food from Red Shrimp was really under par and not of the best taste.  You guys need to step it up!",2
286758,Q6ZT8PBlZl1-6qQAfJFEYA,7VDrYNPhDKFURZbK4MRi8w,"It's an okay place. Not great but that bad. I would come here again.  
We got teriyaki chicken, shrimp and beef. And also shrimp with vegetables. 
I will say that the portions are huge!! My teriyaki I had to take it home and ate twice that day because there was so much. So that's great! The food is worth the money. 
The shrimp with vegetables was pretty yummy and I loved the meat in the teriyaki but their sauce cannot be called teriyaki. It did not taste like teriyaki at all and I didn't really like it. But the plate was good and I would actually order it again. 
Wasn't the best food but decent food. 
What I thought was really rude was that the lady brought us the wrong order to our table. We were hungry so we were gonna start eating. And she came over and took all the food without saying anything. So we were so confused. 
I don't mind that the order was wrong but she could have said why she was taking our food. Or even a simple ""sorry"" would have been fine. 
But overall I would come again.",3

the order arrived hot and fresh  and so quick. we had ordered 8 entrees  and got a free walnut shrimp  that all came with 3 containers of white rice and we also had a order or house lo mein and house fried rice! 

they send TWO drivers to carry it up the stairs and brought it it these huge boxes and I was SO surprised with the amount of food we ordered nothing spilt nothing got squished and they gave us SO many cookies and utensils and soy sauce omg we will be ordering this next Chinese party we have again VERRY soon !!!!",4

This night I had an all girl sleepover and we were hungry due to the party favors. We wanted Chinese, we were craving Chinese so it had to be!

What we ordered:

crab rangoons, egg rolls, cashew chicken, garlic shrimp, sweet walnut shrimp, shrimp in lobster sauce, pepper beef, house fried rice, house lo mein, orange chicken.

It took two delivery people to carry the two heavy boxes of food. We had a mini Chinese buffet going on in my Condo :) You must go and look at the photos I uploaded for this review!

Ok so the service was excellent, the food was hot and fresh! Everything was delicious especially the honey walnut shrimp. Our only item that we did not care for was the shrimp in lobster sauce. No flavor at all and it was super runny and unappealing. 

I am happy to say that this last experience has bumped the Red Shrimp Co up to a 4 star rating which is a huge jump from previous ratings. 

This will be one of our reclaimed spots for Chinese take-out and delivery. However I won't hold my breath because their track record is NOT consistent!

The reason why I took off a star is the portion size are a little on the small side. Between the 7 of us, we ordered about 5 different dishes with extra rice and usually at most places, it's enough but not here.

The pad thai, green curry, and papaya salad were delicious. I was satisfied with the taste of the food. My taste buds were giving me high fives. I believe this is primarily a Thai restaurant so get Thai dishes and NOT the Chinese. One of the stir-fry dishes we ordered was meh.",4
287338,Ocu7QHt-hpXoWQVQDWj_qA,2Dbg35sPSGmZGcbBVNa9dA,"Unmistakably Kung Fu Thai is a hidden gem amidst the easily overpriced Asian cuisine in Las Vegas. Step one to finding delicious and affordable food in Vegas is to get off the strip. So, that's what my family and I did by coming to this restaurant, located in Vegas' ""chinatown"" or along Spring Mountain Road. 

Come here a little before the usual dinner rush on weekends about 6 o clock to avoid waiting. Right after we arrived, multiple parties came and had to wait for a table because the whole place filled up so quickly. 

You must try the garlic beef, pad thai, and papaya salad. Each dish was executed well and the food was brought out fairly quickly. 

My family ordered 5 dishes for 5 of us and there was still some left over. The total came out to be under $60 which is really not bad at all. 

This place is now on my list for some good Thai home cooking if I'm ever sick of the buffets and sky high prices on the strip.

The quantity was pretty small for the price. I felt like the place is a bit small? Since my neighbor's back is only about half a foot away from mine. Maybe a little rearranging of tables might help with rooms. Our server was nice but from my experience I don't recall him checking up on us. I think we waved and called him to us. Cups of water were small and we never had a refill. My gf had to drink my grandma's cup of ice water since they never refilled our cups for us. I would honestly give it a 2.5 stars but I can't so I'll round up that half star. Little improvement with service, you'll get there.",3

I feel like whenever I take a bite of their food, this is what Thai food should taste like. Their Chinese food is pretty good too, although it may not be as authentic as a normal Chinese place, they serve some good Chinese food here as well.

I've been coming to this place with my family for a number of years now. I always love coming to this place for the food and I enjoy chatting with some of the waiters. It's friendly for family, and large parties if necessary. 

My favorite things to eat from here are the pad thai, pad se ew, and general Tso's chicken. Kung Fu gets pad thai correctly and cooks their pad se ew well and both have flavor. Their general Tso's chicken is sweet and has a slightly spicy flavor to it and this is best eaten at the restaurant so it is still crispy when you eat it! I have ordered their curry, vegetable dishes, tom kha soup, and I enjoy them all!

Anyway I picked up my order got back home, I went to taste my tum yum soup and it had a roach floating at the top of my soup. I could have died. I drive back across town and returned it to the restaurant, they told me that the cook must've thought it was garlic and accidentally put it in my soup.... Wow I wonder if this happens often??????

I went to Las Vegas for the summer and ate at a restaurant every day for a week, but Kung Fu Thai and Chinese Restaurant was definitely my favorite. My uncle kept saying that Thai food is good, but I've never tried it and pushed to eat at other restaurants.

On our last night there, we tried this place. I was just FLOORED by how scrumptious each and everyone one of my bites of food were. The waiters provided EXCELLENT service and they were so kind! We went at night, so it was just our huge family of around 30 and another small family at a table near us.

Foods I ate:
-Tom Yum soup
-Seasoned fish (forgot what it was called, but I hate fish and this was one of the only times I enjoyed eating it!)
-MONGOLIAN BEEF *YES YES YES*

I forgot all of the other dishes, but I'm sure that they all had just the right seasoning, texture, and taste.

Definitely give this place a try if you're ever in the area!",5
287350,RIvRSqRB7tdduB_Ub8RCAg,2Dbg35sPSGmZGcbBVNa9dA,"Best of Vegas hands down. Service is top
Of the top and the food is even better. I found this place one time my car was broke down I was taking the bus.
I was on the corner dying of heat in the middle of July at mid day. Guy comes out with with a cup of water after noticing me sitting there rotting in the sun. I took my family over there as a result of their kindness and believe me when I tell you the food is insane ! The fried rice !!! The general  tsao chicken !!!!!!!!!!!! Everything is off the hook and straight up your just nuts if you haven't been there !!!",5

I ordered the fried calamari which was lightly fried , was just perfect.
My main course was chicken panang with white rice, the spice level 2, not too spicy. The papaya salad is my favourite dish , it was fresh and a must to compliment any dish.
To complete I had the Thai ice tea. The portion size was enough for 2 people.

So sometimes we just can't hack it, and call in for some more-edible options. One of those places is Kung Fu. It had some good reviews and a full menu online, so we gave it a try.

It's exceptionally pleasing! Of course, I had to go with Pineapple Fried Rice (my favorite!) and theirs comes in huge portions with chicken, pork, shrimp, and crab! What a catch! (You see what I did there?) My coworker went with the pad thai and she liked it.

The Kung Pow chicken was plain with out spices and barely adequate...more like Junk pow then Kung pow...combo rice was just adequate for chocking down too. To top it of they forgot my pot stickers and the beer was not cold at all...and the server lady scowled at us when we asked for the check.

5 people at our table and they brought out each dish one at a time with several minutes in between. Who does that?

The last time we called she offered to retake our order and start from scratch. Meanwhile, the credit card was charged for food we never received.

service is even worse. the guy who seated us, also took our order and cleared the table. they are understaffed and very un-accommodating. (no, you can't substitute shrimp for chicken) it took us forever to get our food, and even longer to get the check. not to mention the food came out staggered, my husband got his entree, then they brought out the appetizers, then another entree...
food quality was not good; very bland and not fresh. no condiments on the table, and not even enough for each table. they also didn't have enough menus for everybody. 
over all appearance and quality of the restaurant was poor.",1

I told her that "" a lot can change in seven years"", and I was right. 

We both agreed that this was one of the worst Chinese meals we ever had.

The staff did try to please, but they just could not over come the bad food that came out of the kitchen. We ordered a curry dish, kung pao chicken, and a shrimp dish.

My wife took one look at the curry dish and said, ""When I saw it, I knew we were in trouble.""  She was right. Poor quality ingredients, and no taste to it.

The Kung Pao Chicken, a standard which I use to compare Chinese places, was awful. My dogs turned down the left over chicken; The peanuts were few, and tasted like they were purchased from a ball park, six months after the season ended, and the dish tasted liked it was cooked in Motor oil.

Remember those terrible shrimp that are in those 99 cent cocktails in Downtown Casinos? Ever wonder where the ones they reject go? This is the place!!

Top off the food with booths where the fabric is torn apart and needs replacement, and you risk sitting with a spring up your butt, and you have a perfect picture of 
Kung Fu Thai and Chinese. 

Go across the Street to Krung Thai. Better food, nicer place, better prices, and much easier to park.

Trust me, I wanted to give this a Zero, but I am required to give one star. Generous.",1

So we order from the regular menu,the food came dry and I found 2 hairs in my Mongolian beef+it was so chewy like a rubber.
I used to come here a lot and that was my first time after 9 months. This place change and become with tricky services,low quality of food and not clean at all.

The only reason I tried this place was because the Thai restaurant across the street was close that day.  Wish I would have mcdonalds instead of this crap.  Priced way to high too.  Just a really bad choice if you eat here..,1
287369,kPmoGFwD5rIQ9BP3VfYnug,2Dbg35sPSGmZGcbBVNa9dA,Food was really good as always. But we realized this place decrease the portions of food and it's now changing fine dining prices. Well...

They're actually a mixture of Thai, Chinese and Laos.

I dined here back in January and I can't really remember anything exceptional about this place except I enjoyed the papaya salad.

Its your typical Chinese/Thai food restaurant. It's better as family style rather than individual meals, so sharing is caring folks!

I'm sure we will be back whenever we hit Vegas up and we're not at the buffet. LOL.",3

I have not found crab rangoon anywhere that compares to theirs. You order the spice of a dish on a hotness level 1-10. They could be a little more consistent with that but I think it depends on the cook. I dont like too hot so I order a 1 or 2 which sometimes can feel more like a 4 or 5.. but overall, the best Chinese & Thai cuisine.",4
287373,aOpKXr-i2mL43AosbMW-6Q,2Dbg35sPSGmZGcbBVNa9dA,"Having a craving for Thai food in Vegas once again, my friend recommended yet another she was familiar with. So far, I think you can't really go wrong as pretty much all the Asian restaurants I've been brought to has yet to disappoint me. This place was no different.

It's one of the typical informal Asian restaurants you'll find in Chinatown....dated decor and nothing 5 star about it. That's fine as these places are frequented for the food and not the decor. Not to say there isn't any atmosphere as there's hodge podge of Thai and Chinese antiques and motifs.

Like most Asian restaurants, it's probably best to go in larger groups as there are so many dishes to try and the portions are quite generous. Since it was just my friend and I, we just ordered the fish cakes, Pad See Ew (fried flat rice noodles) and the Pad Wan Sen (fried clear noodles). The flat rice noodles was pretty good, but just a bit sweet for my taste. I had actually ordered the fried clear noodles which were quite delicious. However, I had just had this this dish at another Thai restaurant a few days ago, and the other restaurant's taste edges out this one a bit in terms of taste quality. Still good though, and a good sized plate of noodles. The fish cakes were not too bad either, but for some reason parts of it were dry or hard to the chew. 

For a good Thai and Chinese restaurant both in one, and not too far from the strip, then this is definitely a place I'd come to again. Service was good (likely because it wasn't a busy time of day), good sized portions, and the food was worth the money. The other Thai restaurant I really enjoyed was a good 4-5 miles from the strip in a suburban strip mall, and probably a bit too far from the strip to venture out to, unless you have a car and GPS. This place is convenient.",4
287374,1tYqpXcw7DMQwZHZKo351g,2Dbg35sPSGmZGcbBVNa9dA,"This place was packed on a Monday night.  Service was mediocre.  They didn't come and check on us very often.  My sprite (which I got with a Yelp check in) was pure carbonation and with very little to no ""sprite"" syrup.  You can order most items with our without ""spicy""

Chicken Wings:  Very good crispy but tender.  The sweet chili sauce had no heat to it but it was delightful.

Pad Sew Ew:  Pretty solid as far as this traditional Thai dish goes.  Nice flavor, not too much overpowering sauce.

Shrimp Salad:  Refreshing and light.  Shrimp with a light sauce on a bed of lettuce.  The salad was crisp and the shrimp were cooked well.

Shrimp Fried Rice:  Really no flavor at all.  I give them item a 1 star at best.  I've had fried rice at a lot of Thai restaurants and this dish had no flavor whatsoever.

Chicken with Basil:  A little greasy but very flavorful.  The basil flavor really pops out.  Just sop up some of the grease with your steam rice to balance it out.",3
287375,xkcXUnLFT3BQhvSPTNO69A,2Dbg35sPSGmZGcbBVNa9dA,"Adequate service, they could have tried to be at least more attentive. I even asked for those 4 chili sauces from one of the waiters and I still didn't even get it when my table and I finished our food. And we had to seat ourselves in because they weren't even paying attention to is near the entrance. But I must say, I've tried Thai restaurants from both California and Nevada and this place has good food, the dishes here are so perfectly seasoned, there is no too sweet, too plain, or too salty or not enough saltiness. Probably coming back again when I visit Las Vegas.",4

It took around 10 minutes for anyone to come to the table to take our order after being sat. Little did we know this was the beginning of a pattern.My coworkers and I ordered off of the lunch menu (which for the price looks pretty good, I guess that is what gains them the one mandatory star above). Then the waiting game it took a very long time to get the food. The lunch special comes with egg and flour soup which we received first. It was bland and not very good, had to add soy sauce to it to make it even palatable. About 30 plus minutes later we received our entrees. The food was underwhelming at best. I had the Kung Pao chicken with fried rice, egg roll and Thai fried chicken wing. The chicken wing and egg roll were not too bad, but the rest was sub par and not very good. I believe I could have gotten a better meal at an Asian fast food restaurant. Then it took close to 15 minutes to get our check, followed by another long wait to get it back. It caused one of my coworkers to miss a meeting. Not sure how this place has made it as long as it has.",1

We'd never ordered from Kung Fu Thai before, and let me tell you...we will absolutely be ordering from them again. 

Delivery was prompt.  I don't think he had called until after 6pm, and our food arrived about 6:45pm.  Not too bad!

We had:

Crab Rangoon:  Probably some of the best rangoons I've had in Vegas.  Absolutely divine.

Egg Rolls:  On par with Thai BBQ on Maryland and Sahara.  REALLY good egg rolls.

Pad Thai: YUM.  Flavorful,and a good sized portion.

Ginger beef:  favorite of the night!  Delicious.  Tender beef, a little spice...wowza.  So good.

Yellow curry:  VERY yummy.  Fresh basil, chicken, and zucchini.  No potatoes, which is kind of weird to me, but still amazing.  (I'm having left overs for lunch today.)

Unfortunately, my hotel is off the strip and with 104 degree temperatures the last thing I wanted to do was go back out in the heat for food. Did an Internet search for places that deliver. A million pizza joints, but I wanted something different. Came across some good reviews for Kung Fu so I placed an online order.

About two minutes after the order was placed, a gentleman called from Kung Fu to verify some of the things on my order. Whhaaaaat? A restaurant that doesn't just guess but actually follows up with the customer? Amazing! He told me the food would be delivered in an hour but it was more like 30-45 minutes.

And it was sooooo good. I was craving egg drop soup and theirs didn't disappoint. I had also ordered the chicken with chili and mint over rice and received a HUGE portion for the price. Got a large drink too. Cost for everything plus delivery and tip was only about $22, making it more than worth it. Not to mention the awesomeness of having it delivered to my hotel.

Everyone in the office is completely sick of Jason's Deli 3 days in a row, so we tried something different and so glad we did. I've only had the Thai food from Kung Fu, but it's one of the few places in Chinatown that delivers, and figured we'd give their food a try.

We did the order by phone since it was catering, but I was really surprised that their website allows you to do the order online for delivery or pick up. Helps a lot with the language barrier - I don't speak Chinese or Thai, but my coworker made me order (in English!) because she had trouble understanding them. 

We were able to feed 12-14 people for about $160 which is really good. Delivery was on time and there was no minimum or delivery fee. I wasn't blown away by the Chinese food, but it was above average with generous servings at a really reasonable price. I think each half pan was around $40. 

It's not my personal go-to for Chinese or Thai, but the fact that they're cheap, so close to the strip and have delivery makes this place 5-star if you're visiting. Beats paying $25 for sweet & sour chicken from a casino restaurant.",4

Damn man. We got seated and we were promptly brought water however we waited about fifteen minutes for someone to come by to take our drink and food order. After about twenty, a server finally came over and took everything at once. 

After another fifteen minutes, still no drinks so I got up and asked where they were, and as soon as she brought the food is when we got our drinks. The food was decent, however we had to get up, travel to a dirty table, and get our own soy sauce. Also the portions were pretty small. I ordered the general tso chicken and she had the bbq pork wonton soup.

The food like I said, was decent. It's just the service was so awful I couldn't take it, I honestly considered just walking out. There were only about 4 servers on the floor and obviously they were very overwhelmed. The bussers were amazing though, they really hustled their asses off.

wanted green curry chicken $10.25 but it only came with 3 types of veggies, two which i wanted to replace with two other types. with his strange logic, waiter said $2 extra to replace the veggies??? i was already like uhhhhh

so i took another minute to overlook the menu and saw veggie green curry for $8.50. i asked how much to add chicken to that, he said $1-$2. so i did that instead. 

menus need to be updated! my friend ordered panang and menu said it had 4 types of veggies so she got it. dish came out and it only had zuchinni! really? she told the waiter to take it back.

287403,LqBmn11AcS4y5rdVSMXIVw,2Dbg35sPSGmZGcbBVNa9dA,"KUNG FU KICKED TO 2 STARS

   Kung Fu Restaurant broke an important rule. That rule is to NEVER EVER force your customers to leave a minute after giving them the check. Breaking this rule has consequences such as A ONE STAR REDUCTION IN A REVIEW RATING. As a result of their unprofessional action a 3.4 rating is dropped to 2.4 stars that is rounded off to 2 stars. Yikes! kind of how my brother and I also felt. In all honesty this a gentle response considering that many talented Yelper's would reward this experience with a one star rating. 

  Kung Fu Restaurant is located in the Las Vegas Chinatown District at the southwest corner of Valley View and Spring Mountain Boulevard. After a day in Springs Preserve suffering with a hurt left foot my brother and I decided to drive a few traffic lights South on Valley View Boulevard to Chinatown. This would be a convenient choice. Actually not really. Regardless that Kung Fu is at a major crossroads, the parking situation is atrocious. The diminutive parking spaces are more ideal for a golf cart than today's modern vehicles. I'd sacrifice my car if I left it there. So, we parked across Valley View Boulevard near Starbuck's with the intention of a post dinner coffee after. So I'd sacrifice my legs and limbs crossing a busy Valley View Boulevard.

  The service started out allright. Immediately after walking inside there was a booth available (I wonder why). The waiter presented my brother and I with glasses of cold water and the menus. 

  Regardless that there was a large assortment of dishes to choose from, only the entree page dishes included jasmine rice. Nothing about brown or fried rice. I ordered the shrimp chop suey which was around $9.50. My taste buds say that the shrimp chop suey is 3.4 stars. In comparison to the Chinese restaurants that I have reviewed (my Chinese Restaurants list is the home of these reviews) the size of the shrimps trailed in comparison. Generally speaking, or tasting the quality from the vegetables to the sauce tasted fine. The soy sauce gave some taste to the jasmine rice.  With the shrimp chop suey and jasmine rice, I ordered hot tea. In my opinion it is nearly impossible to mess up the delicious hot tea that Chinese restaurants serve. After a few cups of the delicious green tea, I stand by my opinion. Thanks to the Yelp checkin offer, the tea was complimentary. I would of enjoyed a bowl of my beloved wonton soup,  one of my favorite foods in the world going back to my toddlerhood. But Kung Fu doesn't give any breaks with the soup. The war won ton soup is around $9. they ought to include personal portions of soup on the menu. Then again, they ought to include chopsticks on the table. 

  The food was good. I ate everything down to the plate including the sauce. My brother and I were talking at the time the waiter presented us with the check. Around a minute later the waiter tells us to pay because people were waiting for the booth. He wasn't giving us the stink eye and handed us our fortune cookies. Without a nasty demeanor he just rushing us out of the booth barely giving my brother and I time to split the bill. 

  I didn't read the fortune cookie. An appropriate fortune cookie would say something like, ""The average person tells nine other people when they are unhappy with a business where the average Yelper tells a couple thousand people when they are unhappy with a business."" Or the fortune cookie might of said, ""You have a World of restaurants to choose from in your city."" Or the fortune cookie could of said, ""There is nothing like competition."" To close off this review, what I am saying is that Kung Fu rushed us out the door of their restaurant and it is a door I don't intend to open in a long time.",2

I ordered the orange chicken lunch special with fried rice for $6.75 And an appetizer sampler. First of all the ""chicken"" was heavily battered. upon further investigation ( me taking apart the breading ) i realized that the chicken is not breaded in house. Its the cheapest mechanically separated frozen garbage ive ever seen. This meal was worse then the chinese food station at the palace station buffet. With an overly sweet sauce dedicated to hiding the ""flavor"" of this so called version of meat. I was truly disappointed. I envision an owner that cares more about food cost percentages then he does about the quality of the food. Batter your own chicken! Chicken is cheap. Very disappointed!

As for Chinese and you could say Thai food  as well that when we left Kung Fu we would never have the aftermath horror of like that horrible feeling in our stomachs when the food is laced, injected, bathed or drowned in MSG and it's as if you ate something good but when it hits your stomach it metamorphisizes into a few bricks. We were NEVER, NOT ONCE disappointed with the food as well the great service we received here, the food always seemed fresh, no MSG aftermath horrors and the waiters were always polite and kind.

There are two people that we've noticed who take the orders, one is male the other is female. Every time we order from the male, the orders are always correct. When we order from the female, every time, the order is incorrect. Everytime. When we've called back to have them correct the mistake, she will sit there and argue with us.

They also serve a small selection of alcoholic beverages.

Our food was amazing! And the service was fast. I did have to point out to our waiter which white wine I wanted on the menu so maybe communicating your food order over the phone could be tricky. But the fact that they offer online ordering should resolve this problem. AND, do you want authentic or not?! The hostess and our waiter were very pleasant and professional.

Please don't listen to these negative reviews... You Only will be missing a great dining experience.... Huge menu even better preparation... My only complaint is I ate too much....

287414,wGbGaeqJtlhTfkBEQwLUdQ,2Dbg35sPSGmZGcbBVNa9dA,"First off I'd like to preface this review by saying that I've being going here for at least the past 6 years. Service has always been just alright, but you would think since I come I'm in quite a bit, that'd would have at least changed. Nope. I also want to say that by far, they have my FAVORITE Tom Yum and Yum Woonsen. Order it every time. No other restaurant makes it as good as they do. But to the docking of stars. My husband no longer wants to dine here after basically being ignored one visit. We were barely acknowledged, just enough so that we finally got to place an order after being seated for 20 minutes ( again, we know what we want and just wasn't approached prior to this.) When we got our food, I was willing to dismiss the lack of service in the beginning, because the food is just so dang good and  I had an ok history with them. Buuuut, we weren't even on their radar during the meal. Our waters were not once refilled (or offered), no one asked how our meal was, or even if we would like anything else. Nothing. My husband was furious. We talked to them about how we felt neglected from the awful service, and their decision? Give us 10% off. Um. Ok. We are very reasonable people and are pretty polite, even if it comes down to complaining. Had we had a large bill, 10% would have been sufficient. But for two meals, they basically covered tax. Poor customer service recovery, in my opinion, especially for someone that has frequented there often. 
Really disappointed.",2

We knew we were at a great Asian restaurant when we looked around and noticed we were the only two non Asian people in the place. A few others came in later but knowing their own culture embraces the restaurant got us excited.

We weren't disappointed. All four dishes had wonderful flavors and aromas. They tasted very fresh and flavorful. The portion sizes were considerable so trust me you will be taking some home.

We came in yesterday, Christmas Day, for brunch. 

The place was packed, but they found a small table for the two of us towards the back.
They offer a free soft drink with a Yelp check in, and I was able to ""upgrade"" to a Thai iced tea for $1 instead of the normal $2.85.  Deal!

Today we ordered a cup of egg flower soup, egg rolls, shrimp Pad Thai, and Mongolian beef.  

I thought the egg flower soup was gross, but I'm not a fan of that style of soup anyway.  My fella LOVED it.  He said it was some of the best egg flower soup he's had in town. 

The egg rolls were amazing, and let me tell you about the hot mustard sauce...wowza, THAT cleared my sinuses after one bite.  It was absolutely amazing, and I usually don't care too much for hot/spicy things.  

The Mongolian beef was delicious:  tender beef with great flavor and a little kick to it, with peppers and onions and carrots.  

The Shrimp Pad Thai was good too...the noodles were perfect.  My only complaint and the reason for the docked star was that the shrimp were REALLY over cooked.  

Service was extremely polite, and quick.

287998,V6zKVoq0rKZZKORwH1cn1w,y61Tq9hErVKoT6w-qyRpwQ,"Ah golden dragon I heart you. My grandmother is the one who showed us this little gem-apparently its very popular with the sun city (65+) crowd, but who can blame them? They have a killer ayce dinner special for $11.50pp but surprise... It's NOT buffet style. You order off a full menu and everything is made fresh to order! Make sure if you are doing the ayce to let the server know before you start ordering. 

You start off with the appetizers and soup. They have the standard selection of apps; egg rolls, potstickers, pork spare ribs, fried shrimp etc. etc. Tonight we got bbq pork, cream cheese wontons (10) and I got a cup of hot n sour soup. The apps came out fairly quickly and everything was hot and crispy. So much better then when it's buffet style sitting out under heat lamps and getting soggy! Then after apps you can order entrees and rice or noodles. They have a good selection of chicken, beef and seafood entrees as well as different fried rices, noodles and egg foo yung.

We ordered honey walnut shrimp, shrimp pad thai and mongolian beef to start. The walnut shrimp is my favorite it's so sweet and delicious. Not calorie friendly at all but that's what makes it so good. The mongolian beef was tasty but lacked spice. Actually now that I think of it all their ""spicy"" dishes are not spicy at all so I have to subtract 1 star! I like a little kick with my food especially when it is supposed to be spicy. Anyways we ordered another round of wontons and sweet n sour pork and I was so full after that my bf had to roll me out of there! 

A few things to note. If you order the ayce you MUST eat everything and they do frown upon leftover food. They have threatened to charge for any leftovers although it has yet to happen but just be aware. The portions are not huge but I do think they adjust the portion sized based on how many are in your party. I've gone with a party of 7 before and the entrees seemed to be bigger whereas they seemed to have less food when it was just me and the bf. And lastly they don't require reservations but they are recommended for large party. Also keep in mind this review is for the dinner special ONLY. You could of course order ala carte items and they also have take out but this is the best deal and we all know how much I love a good deal! my suggestion would be to go with a group so you can sample a little bit of everything. :)",4

Pricing: Amazing deal. Only $6.49 for all you can eat? I'll take it.

The food quality here is excellent considering it's a buffet. The reason behind this is because unlike most Chinese buffets, Golden Dragon makes smaller proportions of food they put out, thus rendering a fresher and tastier result. They don't serve alcohol here but their Thai tea is off the damn chain. 

Service is good, fast, and friendly. They were quick to refill our drinks and take away dirty plates. 

Personal recommendation: get the chicken wings. I'm convinced this place could survive as a chicken wing joint. So crisp and delicious. I will be back :]",4

We came in about 8:45pm they close dine in at 9:00pm The first thing that was said to us as they took our drink order is that they are closing at 9pm. Well that immediately creates the RUSH vibe. The last thing someone should say to you as you order is that their closing. 

We quickly place our order, excited to see what all the fuss is about! As our food slowly came in we tried to quickly have dinner since we knew they would be closing. Not even 10 minutes into our meal my fiancé takes a bite of his sweet and sour shrimp a pulls a long piece of hair out of his mouth. He was extremely upset, we sat there waiting for someone to help us no one was there. The lady at the front was on her phone as she sat at the register area. Finally I call over to her and she calls back to me across the restaurant. I didn't want to say what I needed to out loud but since it was hard for her to approach us I went ahead and said ""Well there is a piece of hair in our food!"" She then quickly yelled in their language and a server approached us.

My fiancé was taking a photo of the hair cooked into the shrimp as the server snatched the plate while he was taking the photo. She then started yelling in their language took the plate back returned and said Sorry. She said she would bring in a new plate for us. They shortly replaced the plate for us and apologized again. By this time we lost our appetite and paid for the meal. NOTHING was compensated for the disgusting inconvenience of eating a piece of hair with our dish. 

I just wanted to get out of there. They obviously didn't know how to handle this situation correctly.

They have some of the best egg tarts I have eaten in this hemisphere. 

This is a pretty traditional Chinese place, not much English is spoken, the good thing is for Dim Sum Brunch, they bring around a cart, and you point to what you want to eat and chances are it will be good.

I love Dim Sum and Chang's used to be one of my favorite in town, but I will never go there again.  Weeks before my birthday I made a reservation for my party in the small room.  I watched the reservation written down by David and was confirmed for a small family party.  Just to be sure, I came in 6 days before the party and was again assured that my reservation was all set.

We came in today for the party and David, the same guy that took my reservation, claimed that we had no reservation.  The story continued to change (that we needed a deposit; That we had not confirmed that reservation - basically lying).  The manager, David is a sneaky, slimy piece of work.

After enough yelling, David inconveniencing my family, and ruining my birthday party - we were moved into the room.  He was incredibly rude to my mother, who showed up 15 minutes earlier than I had and never said sorry to me.  

long story short: I went above and beyond to confirm my reservation and the managers at Changs lied point-blank and were rude and slippery.  Don't go there - the food wasn't even good today - you are better off at Orchid Gardens.",1

Jesse N and I got so carried away that we did spend a little too much between the two of us, hahaha.  We are not complaining because that happens to us a lot because we want to be able to try everything we can.  The service here was great, they cleared our plates quick.

I asked her what comes in the ""combination noodles"" and she responded - it could be chicken it could be any kind of meat. Uhm, this of all places should NOT be a place where you say it could be anything. Hold the cat yes ?! The cart pushing ladies were much nicer, although very hard to understand.

In comparison:

East Ocean: Not as expensive as this place.  There are more than 2 carts going around serving you food

Harbor Palace:  This place is really dirty.  Food seems like its been hanging out in the cart all day and the service isn't that great.

The staff was very friendly.  Food is constantly being regulated throughout the restaurant and they offer all the delights of a standard dim sum (shu mai, chicken feet etc...) 

Food highlights:  

1. The pork belly is an absolute must get, I kid you not. This exceeds any pork belly i've gotten at goyemon, AYCE kbbq and lechon at the several filipino parties i've been to.  The skin is deep fried to utter perfection while the meat is juicy and very tender.

2. Deep fried shrimp balls with the sweet mayo

3. The duck was very good but a little on the saucy side

4. Chicken feet was delicious.  Plenty of cartilage to suck on 

Service:

A lot of the staff speak 0 english.  Even if you have dark skin, pale skin or blue skin, they will talk to you in chinese.  Staff is very friendly and anyone is willing to stop what they are doing to see what you need.

288713,QY9O2O59Bll0AnE0vDej2g,5tYLVPc2PKnj6E62sY6QMg,"My friends, my family, and I have frequented Chang's Hong Kong Cuisine for dim sum for as long as I could remember. When my family wants dim sum, this is the place to go. When my friends want dim sum, this is the place to go. However, after being away from Vegas for the past 3 years, things have drastically changed. I'm not sure if it's because of my taste buds or perhaps with other dim sum places popping up, such as KJ Kitchen at Rio....things have changed at Chang's.

Quality certainly has gone downhill. The service, on the other hand, I have seen no changes. It's still just like any other Chinese place where it's hard to find anyone to help you when you need it. 

My family and I came here for lunch this past Sunday and I must say, it was very disappointing. Half of the food that we wanted weren't readily available -- they were making it in the back. Some of them came out and some just were never ready. There used to be a lot more carts going around but now it's been reduced to about 3-4 different cards. It also used to be a whole lot more busy here so I assume because of the lack of business, they no longer have that many carts going around. 

The food? Not memorable at all. AT ALL. Some of it was kind of gross .. even for me! The quality sure has changed!  

Overall, I wouldn't suggest this place for dim sum. It's honestly only ""okay"" because this certainly isn't the worst place.",3

For one thing, this place is fairly authentic and not your fancy, over-the-top resort casino dim sum restaurant where you get ripped-off for mediocre food. 

Chang's offer a wide variety of dim sum dishes to choose from. We got the Chinese sliced BBQ prok ""cha-shu"", shrimp dumplings ""ha-gow"", shu-mai , Chinese broccoli ""gai-lan"", salt and pepper squid and prawns. Their BBQ pork steam buns ""cha-shu bao"" were decent and the fried taro dumplings were excellent. The steamed soy-skin wrapped with bamboo and pork was surprisingly good. 

The service was good and what makes it such a sight for sore eyes is seeing older Chinese people sitting at the table next to us relaxing and reading newspapers while enjoying their dishes. Now that speaks volumes.",4

Depending on what you pick, you get stamped for the dish on a price category and in the end, the cashier just adds up the prices of all the stamps on your card. Typically, dim sum is a breakfast/brunch meal.

The place is pretty dark but gets pretty darn busy brunch time area when people are out of church and what not. It's great for families because food choices are flexible and tables are all round seating at least 4+. You really don't have to wait for food that long cos carts are always moving around. BUT, service here is not that prompt and I constantly had to flag down buspeople to refill the tiny water glasses, get chili sauce, or have napkins (to which they only gave me 3). I usually feel bad bugging people, but no one really checked on how we're doing and I know asking the cartspeople won't help much cos they're busy carting food.

Craving dim sum?  Atmosphere is alright. Service is subpar.  But this place has msot of the classic staples of shu mai, pork spare ribs, chicken feet, shrimp dumplings, congee, and more. Expect grease and oils of chinese food and lots of sodium, but it's a guilty pleasure that my family and I can't let go of just yet :)",3

Their shumai and bao are delicious. Chicken feet, anyone? Yum! The carts are constantly going around and if a dish you request isn't on a cart, they'll usually inform you how many minutes before it gets back on. The ladies pushing the carts are pretty helpful. Some may speak hardly any English but they will try to explain to you, if you ask, what the dishes are. Keep the paper for food tally easily accessible to servers on your table. The ladies will come and stamp your food order on it and then you'll take it to the window by the entrance when you're done to pay for the meal. 

The food is relatively cheap and most orders are under $5 so I never had to ask how much each dish costs. Make sure to ask for large glasses of water or they will bring you tiny ones. They might come and check if you need a tea refill but if you happen to run out, just signal for more by turning over the tea pot lid or propping it ajar. This works some times.

It took us a while to find Chang's, and we ended up googling best dim sum place in Las Vegas, and Chang's was the first search result to display. We saw that it was less than 10 minutes away from our house, so we decided to check it out and give it a try. We were definitely not disappointed!

Normally, my biggest gripe about dim sum places is that the venues are normally huge dining hall areas, and the servers cart around the food forever and the food gets cold, and by the time we get it, it is no longer fresh. At Chang's the restaurant is small enough venue, so the food is ALWAYS fresh, especially if you get a table next to where the carts come out from the kitchen. 

I have a few recommendations for the best dim sum dishes. Definitely get the fried pork dumplings (ham shay go). This is my favorite dish there! It's less than $4 per order, which comes with 3 fried pork dumplings. I also really like the Chinese pan friend leek buns (gow choi). This is a less-widely known dish, but is equally amazing. Also less than $4 per order! Other recommendations include: salt and pepper shrimp or calamari, chinese broccoli, pork and shrimp siomai, and har gao (shrimp dumpling). If you stick with these items, you'll be set. I've gone for dinner before, and it isn't the best of Chinese restaurants, so make sure you just go for lunch dim sum, and don't bother with their regular menu items (this is the only reason I rate this place a 4-star versus a 5-star).

We love all of the dim sum items there, and we have dreams about them. No joke. It is one of the places that we always go back to visit when we travel to Las Vegas. Not too far away the strip if you are a tourist. Go where the locals go and don't get dim sum in the casinos. Trust me on this one.",4
288721,SoptLhQyqpjXlHwKMB11GA,5tYLVPc2PKnj6E62sY6QMg,"Packed over the weekends!  Just grab a number and be patient to wait at least 20-30 mins for a table for 4-6 peepz, and expect a longer wait time if you have a larger party.

On the Monday, wait time as expected was zero minute, and we were seated right away! and Yes, we were smart! teeheeee :P

Foods were delicious, in great variety; prices were very reasonable; service was prompt and friendly, yet a little pushy.  This one dim sum lady just kept on stopping by our table to ask whether we might want this and that even though we had said to her, ""no, thank you,"" a couple of times already.

After being spoiled by eating at so many good dim sum places back home in Monterey park/Rowland area, Chang's felt subpar to me. For all my OC ppl visiting Vegas & thinkin about trying this place, I would say it's comparable to dragon phoenix in Bolsa. You have the ladies rollin the cart around, which I don't really prefer because the temperature of the items were barely warm

Surprisingly though, the servers were on top of it here. I don't really expect much service from a chinese restaurant, but our water cups were never empty and the manager was a really friendly guy. We later found out they speak cantonese here, and once again I was used as the person to order everything for the table because I was the only one that spoke cantonese -__-

The place looked really clean for a chinese restaurant and the prices weren't bad.  They had all the dim sum basics such as shu mai, har gow, chinese broccoli, chicken feet, etc. The dim sum items such as shu mai and har gow were a bit small though. The good thing is I don't think they load up on MSG here and the food wasn't too salty. The congee was a rip off though because there was barely any shredded dry pork in it and the fried donuts weren't like the ones back at home.The fried donuts to dip in the congee were too crispy and there was a lot of oil on the plate.

288727,Bg6162KuwzCDSJQiI32PDw,5tYLVPc2PKnj6E62sY6QMg,"The Las Vegas strip is a great place to eat, even if you want Asian food. There are Chinese buffets galore as well as a number of new Korean restaurants (including the nearby Kim Chee Restaurant and at least two others just north of the Stratosphere). But what is really impressive is the string of great oriental food palaces located west of the strip on the street called Spring Mountain, between Sahara and Flamingo.
 
The banquet begins just a few blocks from the casinos. Start with the first large restaurant that you come to driving west, Satay Malaysian Grille. It offers an exotic selection of Southeast Asian and Singapore fare, a mix of Thai and Indian flavors, spicy, sweet and savory good. Try the traditional Satay, the shrimp and papaya salad, and the Laksa, highlighted with peanut sauce, coconut milk, and shellfish. Continuing down the street are a number of Chinese marketplaces peppered with great little eating places. If you seek the familiar there is even a Sam Woo's Barbeque, with its delicious pork, duck and noodle dishes. For fish and crab try Seafood Harbor. For Korean try the Sweet Pig. If Vietnamese Pho noodle soup is your preference there are half a dozen little joints all in the same area.
 
One Chinese treat that I found especially satisfying was the Dim Sum at Chang's Hong Kong Cuisine on Decatur, about ten blocks south of Spring Mountain, just north of Tropicana. Chang's is located in a white Chinese style building on the east side of the street. The day that I went there, on a Thursday, the place was packed with locals, mostly Chinese. They had one of the best sticky rice in lotus leaves that I have ever had, and their fun rolls (rice noodle) were delicious too. The prices were right, with most dim sum dishes costing between $1.75 and $2.50, substantially lower than the average place in LA. I did not eat at Chang's Hong Kong Cuisine for dinner, but I took a look at the menu and it offered a fine array of traditional Hong Kong/Cantonese style dishes at reasonable prices.
 
So the next time you are in Vegas, don't forget to try the flavors of California's favorite Chinatown in Nevada, Spring Mountain Blvd in Las Vegas, and Chang's Hong Kong Cuisine for Dim Sum, seven days a week located at 4670 S. Decatur Blvd. Las Vegas, NV 89103, phone: (702) 362-3663.",4

We we're also confuse because we both aren't familiar with the names of dim sum food so we were constantly describing the server what we wanted and he had to circle it on our charts. 

The food was pretty good but not as great as the dim sum in downtown LA chinatown.

I recommend the rice noodle with shrimp and beef. Super tasty! And are my favorites.  

Price was decent. We ended up paying $30 for like 8 dishes.",3

My favorites:
- Shrimp har gow (shrimp dumplings) - this was amazing the first round, delicate and lightly sweet, but the second round was lacking a lot of flavor and not as tender. 
- Cheong Fun (Rice Noodle Rolls) with Shrimp - lovely pillowy soft noodle texture, but 2 miniature shrimps in each roll.  
- Fried Shrimp Balls served with sweet mayo - this was our favorite, the shrimp balls were super moist inside and flavorful.

I'll pass:
- Pork Sui Mai - This classic was shamefully bland and unmemorable.
- Steamed BBQ Pork Buns - they were on the mushy soggy end. The minimal BBQ pork filling wasn't bad, but it's also not the best either. 
- Chicken Feet - good flavor, but fatty and I couldn't get past how oily it was.
- Fried Taro Puffs stuffed with pork - It had a nice pillowy taro texture, but it was extra soggy on the bottom from being soaked in oil.

We wanted to order more, but no one came to check on us.

We finally got the manager to serve us since he was the only one not on his lunch break. He seemed a little agitated that we wanted to order more. Not to mention, they ran out of a couple items that we wanted to order.

Pro Tip: come during prime breakfast and brunch hours- any time after that the service and food will be nonexistent. 

The restaurant didn't give off a clean vibe. The bathrooms are super sketchy, old, sticky, and scary. It makes me wonder what's the condition of the kitchen.

Described by someone I trust as the best Dim Sum in our little patch of the desert it was with high hopes that myself and three others sat down just after 11:30am at Chang's Hong Kong Cuisine and although the Saturday Cart traffic pattern would frequently prove frustrating throughout the course of our 90 minute meal it was nonetheless with broad smiles that we worked out way through over a dozen baskets of dumplings and buns before culminating in a $12 prepped-to-order Roast Duck amongst the best in the city alongside kitchen fresh walnut prawns far outperforming their modest $6 tab.  Undoubtedly a gluttonous meal but one priced competitively to that of KJ or Cathay House with food on par with the former and far superior to the second as items felt to be 'too old' by servers were twice delayed until fresh versions could be procured from the kitchen it was with a wide swath and steady pacing that we cut our path through a selection of over fifty options and with only the overly thick wrapper of the har gow and oily pan-fried mixed dumplings proving less than impressive to my tooth an 88% batting average was still quite impressive for any dim sum spot, let alone one situated well outside of Chinatown on an industrial stretch of South Decatur.  Having already spoke to the quality of the crispy roast duck and snappy prawns finding skillful balance between cream and crunch beneath a milky sweet sauce it should generally go without saying that freshest items proved the strongest options throughout our meal and with the herb-tinged congee a personal favorite along with molten baked custard buns I'd be remiss to not also mention a pair of novelties that proved equally impressive, the first featuring steamed egg custard topped with tender shrimp in an umami-laden broth and the second a delectable Red Bean Bun delivered  as a sticky golden spin on the cinnamon roll with a slight-savory finish bridging the classic Chinese ingredient to a Western palate in a way that many traditional Dim-Sum 'sweets' do not.",4

Our favorites are; ginger chicken steamed buns, beef in rice noodles, fried shrimp ball and the seafood steamed dumplings. They took pretty long time to bring the food and paying the check was kind of a pain, but overall I would recommend the place. I will definitely be back!",4
288742,i8QvrJEgrvxT50wU6-48yw,5tYLVPc2PKnj6E62sY6QMg,"As I get ready to move, my coworkers and friends slowly have been reaching out to take me to lunch as a goodbye meal. One of those close friends thought it would be awesome to get some dim sum for lunch. I've only been to one place in the valley so I was excited to try another place out.

The place is not in Chinatown but close enough. As you approach the building you'll notice a nice Chinese bridge to walk through in order to get through the front door which I thought was a nice touch. When you enter the joint, you'll notice a lot of space! Big round tables everywhere, big windows, lots of Chinese art and symbols. This place looks authentic. The staff was friendly and although there was a language barrier in some cases, they were very patient with us. 

The food was alright. Not the best that I've tried in Las Vegas. My favorite was a pork and shrimp hash type dumpling. It reminded me of back home. Some dishes that weren't such a success was the fried rice. It was molded in a bowl and super oily. Lots of the things served, seemed to be sitting a while and not as fresh as I've tasted in the past. I appreciated the dim sum selection as there were a lot, however, most of what was offered wasn't as fresh as I hoped. 

I'm thinking this was just a fluke. I really hope to give them another chance soon. I don't necessarily think they were the worst and their staff was super nice. I'll be back and hopefully my review will be updated with a higher rating.",3
288743,k7pmBz4jrgsZGOLZ4YzGhA,5tYLVPc2PKnj6E62sY6QMg,"I've come here a few times either for dim sum or for dinner. The dim sum is pretty mediocre. I've had the typical items which include, egg tarts (when they're fresh they're so amazing. I am not fluent in Chinese, so I would recommend going with someone who is fluent with the language or familiar with dim sum items. You can't go wrong with pork shumai or shrimp hargo. The bbq buns have this delicious honey coating on top. Of course, that makes it stick to your chopsticks, but other than that, it's awesome!  

I've also come here for dinner several times. I love this one tofu dish with scallops.  The last time we went (which was for my friend's birthay dinner, we ordered 2 orders of the dish. They crammed it into one dish, and we felt like they didn't give us the full two orders. I also love the crispy noodles where they pour sauce on top of the noodles to makes the noodles softer. I have never had bad service here. They are always attentive, and I love the food here!",4

288745,8qcIsYWrFqruiKk8PJcK4Q,5tYLVPc2PKnj6E62sY6QMg,"We had a slightly better experience on our second visit here. They changed their ordering process and it's a lot more organized now. Plus, I didn't use their restroom this time around (that scared me on my previous visit.)

We came in around 3:30pm on a Saturday. After we were seated, the manager/server handed us a double sided piece of paper with the dim sum and prices listed - we just marked off on the sheet what we wanted, then we handed it back to our server and they began making it in the kitchen.

The food was inconsistent compared to our last visit - Items that I didn't care for, were actually good this time around and vice versa.

My Favorites:
- Juicy fried shrimp balls with sweet mayo are consistently delicious, plump, and flavorful.
- Fluffy (white) steamed BBQ pork buns were moist, freshly steamed, and stuffed generously with flavorful BBQ pork - They weren't soggy like our first visit. We also took 2 orders to-go and they were still delicious the next day!)
- Har Gow wasn't incredible, they were slightly hardened/dry but they were decently flavored.
- Sui Mai were moist, plump and satisfying.

I'll Pass: 
- Dry and minimal filling in the (glazed) baked BBQ pork buns. It was practically all bread and no BBQ pork. 
- Tiny and dried out egg custard tarts.
- Sloppy and breaking apart cheong fun (rice noodle rolls) with 2 tiny shrimp per noodle. The flavor was average, but the noodles were chunky and dense. 

Chang's is not a terrible option for dim sum, plus they serve dim sum all day so that's always a plus! However, if it's before 3pm I'll still recommend KJ dim sum for the most satisfying dim sum. That's my spot!

There was only one other customer that came, ordered and left when we were waiting for our food. 

The food was mediocre. It filled up my stomach (back in the office's lunchroom) but that's about it.

Service remains true to most dim sum places.., you need to be aggressive and shout out what you want to get attention. The waiters do not check on you unless you speak up. Today we came late, around 2pm. Only two carts circling. Basically had to order what we wanted but had trouble finding our waiter to do so. No refilling our water glasses. So they lose a star for service today.

My only complaint is that the half fried chicken that I ordered barely had any meat on it. The Hong Kong-style noodles with seafood was pretty good though.

Some items are better here than at OG, some are not. The pricing here is better, which makes for good value, as long as you're aware that there's a drop in service.

We were seated quickly- better plan to come earlier than you expect because it does get busy, fast. Table turn over wait doesn't seem too bad though. Service is dismal- I'm used to SF style dim sum houses where the cart ladies harass me to select an item every time they come by. Here, you practically have to beg for their attention in the first place- even if you're Asian, judging by the frustration at the table beside us.

A feast for two came in under $40- the roast duck and salt and pepper head-on shrimp were both $8 dishes (usually charged higher elsewhere), and their pork and shrimp shumai were among the best I've had, great quality. Disappointed that the shrimp dumplings were sticking together and falling apart, but they had good flavor. Chinese broccoli was average, coconut buns were above, pork buns were below. Kind of hit or miss, seems they're better for traditional dishes- didn't partake of the porridge or congee but saw several tables who did.",4

Menu includes tacos: I tried the ""I'm Going Back to Kalbi"" ($4.50)  and was a bit underwhelmed. Portion was wrapped in one corn tortilla that promptly fell apart on the first bite and flavors were one-note. Interested in trying their chicken teriyaki and tofu tacos on another visit.

There are also bowls on the menu, some hand rolls (the Cali was large and only $3) as well as a handful of sides. Tried the miso soup (simple with lots of green onion), the seaweed salad (classic), and the poke (just a bit spicy, really enjoyed this- $4). 

Location is around the corner from a major plaza and has limited parking out front with signage not to park on the side/back of the building. Interior is rather plain but service is friendly.

It tastes like the sauce came straight out a bottle from Costco. 
I got the kalbi taco and I took 1 bite and was done. The meat is so fatty and it's not the melt in your mouth fat either.. I took the single bite and more than half the meat came out connected to the fat and it was crunchy fat.. Idk but not my idea of NOM.  
Oh and I also got the California box roll sushi.. And OMG never again!  I can't put my finger on why but how does a California roll-ish thing go wrong? Humph. 
And as a last resort of getting some sort of food into my system before I left, I ordered the killa Gwen taco.. And it was OK!! YAY I didn't leave totally hungry. 
 Anyway.. All in all, if you're going to charge gourmet prices.. Put in the gourmet effort.",1

They had a good variety of lunch specials, and their food and sushi menu was very extensive. Seemed to have almost every kind of seafood, even some things I have not heard of before. 

Our orders were brought out quickly and the waitress was really nice. The food we got was ok, it wasn't bad by no means, but it wasn't that great either. Although their sushi and rolls looked like they are delicious.

It is in the mix of all the hub bub of the Orleans Casino and we were unsure of what to expect. Of course the place was beautiful and setup perfectly for dinner. We were a bit early by Vegas standards - It was 6 PM - and the place was very empty. I want Chinese I said t myself and in we went. The Hostess was friendly and playful to my humor, asking her if she could possibly fit us in for dinner. Well a beautiful booth was ours and the wonderful, speedy and personable waiter, Antonio, was there to help us with drinks and menus. I just wanted a simple meal f cucumber salad and vegetable lettuce wraps, and Anet had a Schezuan chicken dish. Wow! they came out so quick and beautifully prepared. The cucumber salad had a beautiful tang to it I liked a lot. The lettuce wraps with the hoisin sauce weretp grade. Then the chicken Schezuan had a colorful mix of vegetables, was piping hot and had enough spice to get the lips buzzing. All in all I am ready to go here again and try more items as this visit was a winner.",5

Service very fast (almost too fast but thats typical in the casinos they want you back betting) and attentive. Food was prepared nicely not greasy, or overly sauced which is inherent in so many chinese places. Have a very diverse menu. If traveling alone can get a seat at bar very easily and watch the chefs do their thing.",4

We were seated and the waitress came right away to get our drinks and answer our many questions. She was very knowledgeable about the menu, which was refreshing. 

We ordered the Peking Dumpling appetizer, steamed. I would go back just for those. Wonderfully succulent packets of pork dumpling, with a great dipping sauce. 

My entree was the Mongolian Beef, with fried rice, soup and one veggie egg roll. Normally I'm not a fan of veggie egg rolls, but it was pretty good. Egg drop soup was nice and clean/fresh tasting. My Mongolian Beef was very tender with a good flavor. Rice was so-so, a little on the dry side. One other small note, the iced tea was very weak. 

My husband ordered the half duck, and I'm sure will be writing his own glowing review shortly. He was in heaven. 

Wish we'd taken pics, but it was so good, we just dove right in!

We'll be back for sure!",4
293179,Y6RTQ7jlNL7nFnQdcZGDiw,k-hE27MVMEBWdMsto1DeUA,"I came here for dinner with my Aunty visiting before we went too Cher/Cyndi Lauper concert. Koji Restaurant is one that always pass by when use too place sports bets at The Orleans. I was kind of excited too see the quality of the sushi. I knew it one of the few sushi restaurants no AYCE. Or almost have too assume with the popularity of AYCE only way sushi joint stay in business. It not only sushi/japanese food other half of the menu is chinese food. What I found overall is both sides of the menu is ok. Neither one blew me away. 

We ordered food family style. We got little bit of both sides mention earlier. Lettuce wraps (come different choice of proteins; we went with shrimp) actually pretty solid dish. I like the crispy fresh lettuce. the filling was nice, nice portion size, and the sauce put too taste brought it all together. The beef with chinese broccoli. Ok. Sushi special or basically assorted sushi. One order of spicy yellow tail cut roll. The sushi rice was ok had better. The quality of the fish felt was just ok. If wanted too have chinese food was go too favorite chinese or sushi same case.

We both felt like the restaurant was kind of hot. Maybe the a/c was broke or the fact the place has really low ceilings so not much breathing room. Service was definitely five stars our waitress was on it. She apologizes few times since our beef with chinese broccoli came up late late. She really nice, and made sure never had empty glass came too my soda. They have few widescreen television on sports at the sushi bar. So if wanted too watch game either at the sushi bar or tables not bad seat, The decor nothing special or stood out just another restaurant in hotel. The vibe I got. 

They do have lunch specials. I might make return trip just so try more of the menu. Really if looking for good sushi or chinese night out not the spot would say go too spot.",3

The  hot and Sour soup was o.k. Not bad as both the hot and sour were prevalent, but the flavor was lacking. I was therefore pleasantly surprised by how flavorful my half roasted duck was. My husband had the beef and eggplant, again it was well prepared and flavorful. Service was good. I felt that the prices in comparison to other casino/hotel restaurants like this were reasonable and the quality of food was in line with the prices. I was disappointed with my inability to get a glass of wine that the menu had a by the glass price for. The waiter said that they would only serve it by the bottle, in spite of the menu showing it available either be glass or bottle. Drank water as result.",4

No background music.  Décor was so-so, some stuff was themed, some not so much.  I ordered Crab Rangoon ($4.95 for 8) and Mongolian Beef dinner ($9.95 I think).  About this time one lady came out and started playing a piano in the middle of the dining room.  Not Asian-themed music, but whatever, some live music was somewhat entertaining.  She played 3 or 4 songs and was done...back to silence.  Crab Rangoons were good.  Mongolian Beef flavor was on point...beef was a little low quality, the kind that is slightly rubbery but easy to chew (sorry, it's hard to describe but I've experienced this from other places too).  While sitting there with no music I could overhear everything.  I overheard the Server speaking with another and explaining that they didn't have all the items on the menu so for them to tell her what they wanted and she would go find out if they had it or not...thought that to be a little off-setting for the customer.
The place is connected to a gaming bar/lounge area on the other side of a swing door so they offered a full bar for beverages, but you had the bar customers coming over in to the restaurant to use the restrooms so that would be a negative I felt.
Honestly, for the dine-in experience, I would probably choose somewhere else.  While sitting there I saw several people come in and pick up take-out orders.  I could definitely see myself doing take-out though.",3

The restaurant is quaint and seemed clean from what we could see.  They even had linen table clothes and napkins.  You don't see that too often.  I was surprised the place was not packed at dinner time.

And that usually means something soupy. Although I knew the emptiness of the restaurant implied not-so-great food, I wanted quiet time and dedicated service. 

I ordered a bowl of wonton soup and unable to resist the happy hour special (50% off sushi 2-5pm on weekends), some tuna and salmon nigiri sushi. The soup was pretty hearty, with some bok choy and a couple of slices of pork. The pork wontons were good and salty. Just what I needed! 

The sushi, on the other hand, was just okay. Although the portions were good, the fish was obviously not as fresh as I would have hoped. But maybe this is what I get for ordering happy hour sushi?",3

After exploring many restaurants, one night we were feeling a little indecisive. We ended up coming back to our hotel (The Monte Carlo) & decided to go to Dragon Noodle Co. after remembering some adverts from the elevators in the hotel.

We scanned the menu, which was average but it looked like it could put something together quite easily for me (being that I'm vegan). We were seated quickly & courteously by the girl at f.o.h. and she let us know who our server would be. From there, the entire experience went down-hill.

Firstly, our server left us with menu's and didn't come back for 15 minutes. I'm all for being given time to decide, but we just couldn't get his attention. We came to realise quite quickly this was due to the two large tables (one seated after us) that were sat adjacent to us, one with 6 the other with 10. The server provided us with the bare minimum of service (actually less) and he was clearly making sure his tip at the end of service was good with these tables.

When my girlfriend and I placed our orders, he had complied that a dish variation of one on the menu could be made vegan, no problem. He advised it was a ""special order"". In addition, he did not ask us for drinks or provide us with a drinks menu. We waited 45 minutes and I had to get the attention of another server in order to ask what the delay was- ""it's taking some time to prepare your order, but it will be ready soon!"" I ordered Szechuan vegetables & tofu with noodles. 

My girlfriends dish arrived before mine. She stated it was bland and lacked any flavour. My dish still hadn't arrived and I asked again, what was the delay? No answer but ""I'll check with the chef"". My dish came back with the server and I couldn't have been more angry- sautéed onions and tofu on fried noodles. No szechuan, no sauce. Nothing. When I tried to get the server's attention, again, impossible.

I had to leave our table to find a member of staff willing to talk to me. I explained the situation and massive delay with the answer ""what would you like me to do about it?"". So I asked to speak to the manager- another 15 minute wait. I explained the situation to the manager, how frustrated, disgusted and angry I was with the server's attitude and the terrible dishes. I stated that I would pay for my girlfriends meal (which was half eaten) but not mine (which I didn't touch) and that we wanted to leave. He understood and apologised, stating he would not charge us for either. I appreciate that the manager was kind, polite and did not charge us, but it did not make up for the situation and the hour-and-a-half we had spent there.

Incredibly poor service, rude staff, ridiculous wait time for food that had nothing to it and lack of service simply because we were a table of two and not six. The first restaurant I have ever walked out of mid-meal. Don't waste your time here!",1

We had tickets to Blue Man Group, and wanted somewhere close and reasonably priced. We made a 7:00 reservation. 

When we arrived at 7:00, the hostess was no where to be seen (the hour we spent there, I only saw the hostess go to the hostess stand once). We were finally seated, ordered drinks, appetizers and food.

The wontons were ok, nothing to write home about. The calamari was VERY good (the only positive thing I have to say). I ordered beef with broccoli, my husband the fried rice. It wasn't too long to wait for the food.

The beef with broccoli was not served with rice. When I asked, the waiter said rice didn't come with the dish???!!! I asked for him to bring me some.

The food was no better than what we get at home for the takeout place, but cost three times as much.

Vegas is heaven for that reason, and this place inside the Monte Carlo has the best soup.  You get a large bowl, but the quality is what sold me.  The broth was delicious.  The noodles were chewy goodness.  Bok Choy and Won Tons perfect.  And I always add in the Crispy Duck.  Great flavor.  I always get good service, so maybe I was lucky.

No flavor at all. The crab in the California roll was a big chunk of imitation crab and was horrible. The tuna on our roll was mushy. The only thing we enjoyed was the calamari. The prices are steep but for Vegas we always figure they are steep everywhere and usually we LOVE this place. I feel deceived and that is clearly why I will never return. I paid with my credit card and we left a CASH tip. I signed a receipt for $103. When checking my bank statement today I noticed a charge for $119. When I called them a woman explained that they guarantee themselves a tip. Who does this?? I know places add tip for large parties, but you see it and you know what your signing for. I believe a tip is earned and isn't automatic and though we did tip over 20% in CASH..This a deceptive way of doing business. They have lost a valued customer in my family and I .

The decor was quite nice, which makes you wonder why it's so empty? Maybe we just came during a bad weekend. However, they had some sort of baby mascot or something, because the odd baby face was plastered EVERYWHERE (i.e. menu, sign, above an archway) and gave me the slight creeps...

Anyway, they had a decent selection of soup noodles and non-soup noodles (hence the name). On each table they even had an ordering paper for sushi rolls, I suppose for when it's happy hour and people are more prone to order them 50%. However, we came too early during lunchtime and were less inclined to order them full price. I ended up ordering the soup noodles with BBQ pork/charsiu, while my boyfriend got the soup noodles with beef and wonton (for an extra fee). The noodles came out looking very hot and delicious, but upon tasting, were a little bland. Apparently the wonton were not worth the extra price either.

Once we finished, even though we were the only people left in the restaurant, we had the hardest time getting our waiter's attention to get our check...kind of silly. But it came with fortune cookies at least.

We took a spot at the sushi bar and ordered up some edamame, tuna roll, ell roll, rainbow roll, and spicy tuna roll.

We arrived around 7:00 and the restaurant was not busy at all, which was nice as we had a large group of 8.  I ordered the California Volcano roll, which is my absolute favorite roll!  Not every restaurant has this roll (a california roll topped with spicy tuna), so I was excited to have it!  The roll was fresh, and an appropriate serving size for a reasonable price (especially on the strip).  I also ordered a side of pork spring rolls, which was mediocre -- I wouldn't order it again.

My friend and I also shared the ""Volcano"" drink, which is a mixture of various types of alcohol and fruit juices.  In the middle of the drink, there's a shot of Bacardi 151 that is lit on fire!  It was a lot of fun to drink, and got us pretty tipsy.  In fact, we ordered a second drink to share, so we basically drank one each.  The drink was pretty expensive, but considering it was supposed to be shared by two people, it was a good value.

The service was a little strange, but I think it was mostly because of the language barrier.  We asked the server a couple of questions (most importantly, can we drink the alcohol that was set on fire or was it lighter fluid?), but she did not really understand us.  The timing of the food being served was strange, as some people received their food much earlier than the others. 

Overall, I would return to Dragon Noodle Co, but it really is just a place to grab a quick bite of sushi and a drink.  Do not take anyone here on a date or for a special occasion, as it is very casual and low-key with traditional Chinese decor.",4

(Aside- we think the restaurant selection in Monte Carlo is about as good as it gets for moderately-priced hotels in Vegas.)

Rather than try to order a couple of entrees, soup and rice and spend over $100 we opted for one of their family dinners which was about $24 a person and included a couple spring rolls and won tons, soup and rice...probably one of the best deals you'll find at any restaurant on the Strip.  We opted for Kung Pao chicken and Broccoli beef and considering it was Vegas, we didn't expect huge portions but we were wrong.  We got a good portion for both dishes and we actually had trouble finishing it.  The Kung Pao chicken, while tasty didn't really have much heat which you kind of expect from anything done Kung Pao style.  The Broccoli beef was delicious and full of garlic in every bite which is something that I really enjoyed....the rice was tasty, but not the best fried rice I've ever had which knocks this review down a peg, but otherwise we got a pretty tasty dinner for not a whole ton of money. I'll definitely come back to this place next time I'm in Vegas!",4

We ordered a whole steamed fish (flounder was the fish of the day) along with some stir fry noodles and rice. The waitress offered the option of the fish fillet, maybe because I'm caucasian? LOL We confirmed we wanted the whole fish. We both had hot tea to drink. The fish was well steamed, tender and a nice size. We ate all of it. Noodles were ok, chow mein size noodles with some veggies and meat...nothing to rave about.

Relax, we're past all the club scenes, so no wilin out here. We came here, which happened to be in the same hotel we were staying in, the Monte Carlo, and my pregnant friend was craving ramen. Well none of us were satisfied, but  still we ate and uh yeah, that's all folks!",1
304193,iM2jjDwgoY8JJsD93pPG-Q,q35bospqfYhJfMsqE79NvA,"I was staying at the Monte Carlo and late in the day my girl wanted some soup. Something light and brothy to be easy on her stomach. So to make use of proximity we went here, hidden in the corner of the hotel. There was no wait and the restaurant looked about half full. The hostess was cool as was our waiter. He looked like he was also the bartender. 

He was great, constantly checking on us before and after we ordered. My girl had the ""soup noodles"" with chicken and vegetables and I got the ""soup noodles"" with roast duck. I don't know who wrote the menu, but that's how they wrote it. ""Soup noodles with...."" 

The soups came out in somewhat quickly. Normally that would be a plus for me, but in this case, not so much. I found that the noodles were a little undercooked and clumped together. The chef didn't dip them in hot water long enough to prevent them from sticking together before adding the broth. So it was like trying to eat a chewy birds nest. The roasted duck looked good, the skin was good, but the meat was very rubber like. And they prepared it in a way where it was mostly bones. So it was like eating bones with some duck meat. Very little duck meat. I've eaten a lot of duck, even at a lot of cheap Chinese restaurants. And this was the worst. Disappointing it was. The saving grace was the broth, which I thought was pretty good. 

Other than that I still tried to finish it all. We had a show to get to and not a lot of time to get to it. And for the what this cost, I didn't want to waste my money.

Truer words have never been spoken! 

A little backstory: I saw this place while I was shopping at the beauty warehouse in the same parking lot, and the big sign that said ""Lunch Buffett $5.99"" caught my eye..Chinese buffets are usually pretty affordable for lunch, so I didn't think the price was any indicator of the quality of the buffet. 


WRONG! 

This is the first time since 2007 that I've tried a new restaurant without reviewing yelp first. Why oh why didn't I check the reviews? 


Perhaps the ""air conditioner stolen"" sign (see photo) should have been an indicator of something. My ""buffet preview"" revealed a semi-decent selection, but the food was greasy, old, cold, greasy, disgusting, oh and did I mention GREASY? 

I picked up several ""clean"" plates that had food debris all over them. The food wasn't labeled correctly, and it just looked sad.

Speaking of sad, I learned a valuable lesson: before deciding to eat at an establishment, I will ALWAYS check the expressions of the patrons. Everyone dining there looked depressed to say the least. I felt the same way after dining there. They should be handing out Prozac with the fortune cookies.

My dining partner ""paid"" for the meal shortly thereafter in the bathroom across the street.  My goodness! Save your money and your appetite.",1

I do not even know how to explain this place. I came here with my mother (whom she insisted to eat here by her suggestion) during lunch special. The deal was great and affordable however, the buffet layout and food was a tall tale for me. 

The layout of the buffet was minimal and were VERY adjacent to each other. It may look like it doesn't serve that many choices and to the eyes of the buffet veteran, this may be some joke. lol when passing around, you can barely fit two people in between two buffet serving stands. I had to literally stand outside of it until it cleared before I went in and quickly grab what I needed. 

The food: by the gods of food and wine, I have never been so disappointed. Probably the most cheapest and generic things I ever seen. Some of the food were so stale, especially the meat dishes, it's a disaster. I seen a ""chow mein"" dish and it was basically cheap, flimsy, almost-mushy, waxy ramen noodles sauté in yellow curry powder. How is that chow mein? And I seen labels that were marked ""dinner only"" for dishes that were not meant to be touched. 

Really? I do not know. This place confuse me so much, I don't know whether the cooks were actually robots with no heart to put love into cooking. I asked my mother why this place, she agreed, I'll be making the choices on what places to eat. Lol  the eating experience wasn't worth my time. Cheap, flimsy food.

I ordered the curry chicken and the potatoes were raw and no sauce very dry! Then the manager came over and kindly offered to redo my plate. He whisked all my food away while I watched my husband and son ate. They brought my steamed rice about 10 mins before the replacement meal and then it was cold by the time the chicken curry came back! Potatoes still raw but no one even asked! Don't you think all the chicken and sauce gone and potatoes on the plate was a great clue lol! No offer to comp or reduce price.

As soon as I got there I asked for a booth -- they claimed they didnt have any although I'm pretty sure I saw some open in the back.  So I took a seat at the bar anyways, which I didnt really like because it's such a public area the way it's placed, with everyone walking by through the casino right next to me while I'm trying to eat.  

First thing I do is look at the drinks menu -- only  a handful of cocktails with even less that look appealing. I ordered the lychee martini, and as it turns out, they can't make it because they stopped making the lychee liquor.  Alright. Well somehow tons of other restaurants still manage to serve these,so whatever. I ordered another drink in which I could taste the vodka way too much.  

Then I ordered the cream cheese wontons.  The server comes back a few minutes later, and guess what, they don't have that either.  Alright, fine, I order gyoza instead.  Surprise surprise -- the server returns again and let's me know that they don't have gyoza either.  In fact they dont have any of the fried dim sum.  At an Asian restaurant. At 630 in the evening.  Seriously? They aren't apologetic about it at all.  I was pretty nice about it, albeit rightfully disappointing, which they didnt seem to appreciate for some reason.  

So I went ahead and just ordered the crispy honey shrimp. I order that a lot at Elephant Bar, and it was pretty good here but not comparable.  The quality/texture of the meat was weird.  It seemed...dry?  I'm not sure how to explain it.  It was a

My friends ordered the sushi and ment I need it was pleasant but nothing to write home about. I ordered the General Tso Chicken.  My sauce was bitter (thinking it was mixed with something or not prepared correctly.

We sat there for a long time waiting for the waitress to come back so I could ask her about the mayo. Her response was, ""well there's only a little mayo to bind the crab inside."" Too bad I don't have a little allergy. The manager came over to apologize but didn't even offer to take care of the bill.

It was a decent selection of breakfast staples -- waffles, pancakes, eggs, french toast, biscuits & gravy, sausage, bacon, and even not so typical things like egg rolls, pot stickers, and fried rice.

Wife enjoyed her food, my chicken was dry, and the ribs were good, but not great. The fried rice was ok, would have been better if they gave you the option to add shrimp or chicken to it, but since it came with the meal that wasnt an option. The thing I don't like is 90% of the sides are a la carte so if you want chow mein or fried rice with your meal be prepared to pay $10-$15 more.

I watched our entrees sit by the kitchen for about 15 minutes before finally being prepared and taken to us...they were needless to say, cold.

It took a while to get that delicious pizza and while I was walking back I noticed that my meal had FINALLY arrived..  My family told them I canceled it and I complained to the waitress and the manager and all I got was a sad face from them.

When I informed the waitress that I anticipated an actual roll, she gladly provided me with the menu so I could make a selection of something I'd eat but neglected to remove the Monkey Brain from my receipt, which I did not eat any of. It would have been nice if she would have informed me that I was ordering something other than a roll, obviously not being from around Vegas.. SO that was $9 wasted. 
On a positive note, my cup of hot and sour soup was pretty delicious and the second item that I ordered was the NY Roll.. It was okay - I was only able to eat half of it by the time I finally got it to the table. 
Drink prices were insane, so we skipped on those.

Speaking of crap, the Chinese Chicken Salad was dry, devoid of flavor and the ""red ginger dressing"" had no binder, like oil, to bring things together. It was tomato paste and ginger smeared in a gelatinous glob on my scant chicken chunks, iceberg lettuce and wonton strips. Inedible, and our server, Manny, never asked why it went uneaten. I am guessing that is a dangerous question for a server to ask at Chin Chin.

Steve's Mongolian Beef was overly sweet and cloying and while he felt that he liked it initially, after about three bites he was actually eyeballing my shit show of a salad in the futile search for something with a little acid to balance out the flavor of his sugary beef. (His miserable pork fried rice was certainly no help as it lacked any complexity of flavor and tasted like hot, greasy wok.)

The pork wontons were so average as to be unmemorable except for being over-priced and served with some incongruent pineapple reduction. When I asked Manny for traditional pot sticker sauce he cheerfully dropped off a bottle of soy sauce as he cruised past our table.

The shumai might have been the best item. The fried rice was prepared without soy sauce (as the menu indicated) so it could have been bland but we liked it a lot. Last visit might have been ten years ago and I remember thinking the salad and dumplings were not as good as my first experience decades ago in Studio City. This time it rocked. We will definitely stop by next time we're in Vegas.",4

PF's before and had the wrap that everyone raves about - not my taste at all. So, a couple of friends and I went the other night. I decided that if I couldn't find a healthy (IMHO) vegan offering, I'd have water only. To me, healthy is NO sodium and NO fat added. Basically impossible to order that from any menu at any restaurant. PF had nutritional info listed on-line. One, and only one, dish fit my bill. But, it's one more than most restaurants. Buddha's Delight. Brown rice and steamed vegeys. Nothing else added. Exactly what I needed and was looking for. Healthiest (for me) meal yet. My buds enjoyed their meals and I enjoyed mine. Staff was courteous and friendly and efficient. If it pleases my friends as well as my taste buds AND it has a vegan AND healthy offering, how can I give it anything but 5 stars?",5

315108,4KunGKfx5dF1GxXBvOYVgQ,Ug97walz3YLxPMrpkktsFg,"Walked in before noon time today by myself, the place was empty.  The hostess asked if I would like to sit at the bar or full service, I said full.  She put me right behind of the order machine (which I wasn't aware of at that time) where every waiter or waitress took their orders would go behind me to enter those orders.  Worst place to sit in the house!
My server was okay, he wasn't very helpful when I asked a few questions.  First I asked about what type of hot tea is good for sore throat (from cold), no specific answer was given, fine!  So I ordered a tropical green tea, not bad.
Then I started with a cup of wonton soup, but I tried to change my order for a bowl instead of cup after 10 seconds of my order, he said too late, the order has been entered (the machine just right behind of me, ding2x).  I felt like it was quite rude to say that..., sure there's a way to revise.  My vibe was going down south from that point.
After glancing at the menu, I decided shrimp candied walnut based on one of the yelp review.  Then he asked if I want a lunch portion that came with soup or salad, or dinner (he only gave me a dinner menu).  Well..., if I knew it did come with soup, I may not order the wonton soup in the first place, since I'm not a salad person.  I ended up with a dinner portion.  I wasn't impressed with the meal, it was a cold creamy dish.  The white rice was dried, tasted like overnight rice.  Had a few bites, decided to take it home.  Since the place was getting busy, all the entire of orders just came straight behind me!!  Very annoying!!!  The manager came by and asked if everything was okay, I didn't want to make a scene out of it, so I was politely said okay.  All of these happened, I still gave 18-20% tip, but I won't be back again..., thanks to the hostess, service & disappointed food.",1

I remember that I always enjoyed the garlic noodles so I knew this was a must on our most recent visit. We also got some spicy chicken, eggplant, garlic spinach and fried rice. The food was ok and my memory hadn't failed me. The garlic noodles were again my favorite dish. The chicken and eggplant were entirely too sweet for my taste. The fried rice was ok and so was the spinach, but I was hoping for more garlic flavor. I wish I only ordered the garlic noodles and if I ever come again (which isn't likely) I would stick with them again. 

Service was ok. Our server was attentive at first but when a large party came in refills became a little more infrequent. He apologized and tried to be as attentive as possible, which we appreciated.

She mentioned she would let my server know. No special dessert ever came. I saw the server had brought a birthday dessert for the table across the way.

Besides that, the bar help is very attentive and eager to get you in and out. So, that worked for us.

Me and my husband had lunch yesterday. We walked in at about 3:30. The section we were sitting in had a total of 4 tables being used the rest of the restaurant was pretty empty. We sat down the waiter took our drink order and left. From the beginning our waiter was ver standoffish. Anyways he took our Order we got the meal for 2 for 40 dollars. The chicken was dry the quality of the food has definitely gone down. It took him forever to get me a new beer and for him to refill my husbands drink. I ordered siracha and got it at the end of my meal! The rice was mediocre  at best. At the end of the meal we ordered another order of drinks and never got it. So we payed our tab and left. I was so disappointed :( never coming back to this location.  60 dollars gone and a bad taste in my mouth.  The only reason I gave two stars was because the dessert which we got to go because the lack of service was making me really upset was pretty good.,2

The main reason for this is that if you go to a Dim Sum restaurant and don't speak the language, you may not know what it is that you are eating, and that can be pretty scary.  That said, I have had some great experiences at the Spring Mountain Road restaurants.

Food is perfection.  Buddha's Feast (veggies) stir fried spicy is as good as it gets!  Kung pow's are all great.  The rice is sticky and tasty.  Nice ambiance and decor.  Waiter/waitress very nice and helpful.  If your in a rush, it's quick.  Close to Las VEgas Blvd. so very convenient.

Suggestion: Add parking lot security, as the restaurant is located across from the Silver 7 casino where a whole host of degenerate meth-head alcoholics gamble.  They then seem to think of the Changs parking lot as hand out city.",5

I had to move them around Tetris-style to sign my credit card slip.

Since that first visit though they have managed to dissapoint me. The service is fairly quick but their food quality  has gone way done. 

The first time I had their green beans they were savory, tender and sweet. Now they are bland at best and maybe even a little on the raw side. Their sweet and sour chicken is literally mush. Do not recommed..",2

Building is not visible from the street, the front says Sonny's Saloon and Diamond Chinese is located on the left back side of sonny's saloon.

Positive:
You can order alcohol from Sonny Saloon 24/7
Quick delicious Chinese food made from a real Chinese man in the back
Nice friendly service... 2 different nice Chinese ladies very sweet and attentive.
Mapa tofu is good.
beef with black bean curd sounds gross but is delicious
garlic chicken yum 

Negatives:
SODA is out of a 2 liter!!!! I seen it! oh HAIL no!!! I'm a soda enthusiast and that is not cool
Chicken is kind of suspect... even though I always order it I'm always curious of where the chicken came from.  lol
Sometimes when the chef is different you don't know if it may be salty or the usual awesomness.  

Remember this is a hole in the wall... but its good food.

The quality has diminished.  I really love sesame chicken and theirs used to be so good.  On several occasions, it was dry and hard.  I also hate spring rolls.  But it did have a good price with decent portions.  I have quit going, but it still deserves 3 stars for their combo platters.  Good fried rice",3

The crab rang goons are pretty good too. Prices are good, and it's way better than Panda. The staff here is very friendly, and always working with smiles on their faces. The place is located at the back of the shopping center past Olive Garden, sitting next door to One Love Vapors.

Unlike some other restaurants, the mongolian beef here was seared and tender and was not full of chewy grizzle.

We had the salmon and an eel sushi box, while a friend of ours had the teriyaki shrimp. For an appetizer we had an order of crab rangoon and it was pretty yummy.",4
322222,pP_K4NEoR1Yzx1nABYsSUg,Bpp8unXZmbyxSZS7D93Jog,"First off store front is very traditional storefront/ interior. They have a assortment of food Chinese to Japanese . If you get tired of China a go go like mentioned below you MUST !! TRY THIS. 

The order : Crab Rangoon, hot and sour soup, Philadelphia roll General Tso's Chicken and Pork Fried rice all small portions at 28 !!!! When she told me the price I was like really all that for under 30 bucks ! 

Crab Rangoon -- If not the best I have had to date, lightly deep fried honestly I couldn't even tell it was put in a fryer no resemblance of fryer oil nor smell. This is honestly really really good. (5 pieces give or take ) 

Hot and sour soup -- nice mix of shredded beef, egg, bamboo shoots not too spicy nor not to mild also they give little fried crisp that again not waited in fryer oil or greasy. Very good soup. 

Phili roll -- amazingly good high quality sushi rice everything worked real nicely. 

General Tso -- I normally get this to test out Chinese food places because I have seen so many ways / sauces that go on it i.e. brown sauce, or red sauce.  This was been my fav so far I haven't had this good since living in Washington State. For small portion is actually quite large see pics also comes with white rice. The sauce is a mixture of brownish redish color with medium heat index to it witch is nice cause sometimes it can be done over baring heat. I will strictly return for this dish as its one of my favorites. 

Pork fried rice-- its above your average fried rice dishes. The rice again is quality normally you might get hard rice and under-cooked witch I have gotten from some places before. This was really good nice mix of meat,rice, veggies.  


Again the ticket price for food was the shocking part 28 dollar for all this food, I still can't believe it. The portion size for small is well enough for 1-2 people to eat and maybe have left overs. I seen there menu for Japanese food I am hoping the Gyoza , and miso soup are amazing if so you def. have my business. There sushi prices are amazing I think the most expensive sushi roll was 15$ DO NOT LET THIS PLACE MISS LEAD YOU FROM THE OUTSIDE TRY IT !

Side note this place can only get better if they started offering dessert menu. i.e. green tea ice cream, mango etc.. I think that would put this place over the top.",5
322223,pYdy0YK7irEbJdsxCBl2bA,Bpp8unXZmbyxSZS7D93Jog,"I decided to go again at it. 
I have a reason for only my 4 stars this time.

The order : hot and sour soup small $1.50, pan fried dumplings$4.95 ish and a order general tso chicken $ i think it was 5.95 and also they do carry 2 liter and can drinks for delivery I didn't know this before hand. 

Hot and sour - great as always and one heck of a value at $1.50 

Pan Fried Dumplings- really good I can taste a little ginger or something I couldn't point out but really good same with sauce.

General Tso' Chicken - always cooked to perfection however this time it was heavily garlic tasting I am Italian so I can handle garlic, but to some people that might be considered way tooo much. The first time I got it, it was amazing like this time it was crispy etc.. however just sightly overly garlic 

I will be back and back even with this small thing, the food is always good here. I don't like recommending places off of one visit but this is a second time and the food quality is really great. And to correct my over stated dessert menu they do serve some type of donuts ? I am not sure what kind will probably try next time. 

They should put on there website that they carry 2 liter or can products because there online menu at there website doesn't mention any drink products.",4
322224,0gqxAlWwCfIscRnt_eAkNg,Bpp8unXZmbyxSZS7D93Jog,"I'm a fan of mom and pop shops that may appear sketchy on the outside (and the inside.) You'll never know what pleasant hidden gems you may find unless you give them a try. 

We went based on the sheer fact that they were open later than most Chinese restaurants in the area. The antiquated blue interior was uneasy on the eyes, but it was clean. 

They have great combo specials served all day for $6.95. Not a bad deal at all! This is a great spot for lunch and dinner at bargain prices. You can also choose your entree size: small (under $6) or large (under $10). They offer generous portions, so we would try small next time. 

The good:
Crab Rangoon $4.25 - 6 large pieces of crispy golden fried wontons stuffed with cream cheese. Very addicting! We enjoyed it with their sweet and sour sauce. 5/5

Hot and sour soup - we ordered a small $1.60 and it was piping hot and the perfect size to share. Great flavor! 5/5

Moo shu pork served with eggroll wrappers and hoisen sauce - we ordered a large $8.25 and it was a very generous serving. It had mushrooms, cabbage, pork, and bamboo shoots. It was a great version and we really enjoyed this flavorful dish. 5/5

The bad:
Sweet and sour pork - ok, so we definitely took the wrong step with this dish. We ordered a large $8.25 and although the portion was massive, each pork morsel had way too much breading. Just imagine the dough on corn dogs...each pork was excessively covered in thick dough. Way too filling, in a bad way. It was bland as well, so we added salt to the sauce and it helped. Also, they barely gave us any vegetables and pineapple, so overall it wasn't a balanced dish. Nope I wouldn't order it again, it was poorly executed. 1/5",4
322225,BaHKtOgi6xi_PfI7BmGgRQ,Bpp8unXZmbyxSZS7D93Jog,"I have eaten all over town, by far this is my ultimate favorite Chinese food. They have great price for weekday lunch specials and their hot & sour soup is aaaawesoooome! There not a single dish that I have a complaint about, no kid.

I came in with a specific to go order with a few special requests and the clerk who helped me was awesome, not only was he helpful but didn't seem the least flustered. I certainly appreciate great service, as to the food, it was great.

Mongolian beef: great flavor, nice amount of heat but not overwhelming. The dish does have a lot of vegetables like other reviewers mentioned but that's not a huge deal for me, especially since they were cooked well and added to the flavor.

Sweet and sour pork: I wasn't really used to seeing the sauce on the side, but that won't deter me from ordering again. When dipped into the sauce it all came together well and it lets you add as much or as little as you like. It also has the added bonus of not making the breading soggy.

Hot and sour soup: lives up to its name in a good way, a flavorful broth with a nice ratio of tofu, mushrooms and pork.

Egg flower soup: I'm not a fan of this in general so I skipped it, but my wife enjoyed it.

Pork fried rice: one of the best I've ever had, not over loaded with vegetable and full of big chunks pork in every bite.

The bottom line, try it for yourself but I have found my new go to spot for Chinese take out.",5

We were craving Chinese but were too lazy to drive, so we turned to yelp to find the best delivery in our area.  

The food here was pretty good.  Menu seems simple.  Delivery was fast.  We ordered 4 dishes which came out to $37.  Portions were huge.  

The orange chicken was the best thing we ordered.  Big chunks of chicken that was seasoned and cooked well.

The kung pao chicken was okay.  Huge portion but a tiny amount of meat.  It was basically kung pao veggies.

The Mongolian beef was okay.  Same problem.  Very little meat buried in a huge pile of onions.  

The last dish was a thin white noodle dish in a clear sauce.  This would've been better but the noodles were soggy. 

Maybe next time I'll pay extra and ask for double protein.",3

This was the only place we found on Yelp that we could actually read the menu.  It also offered family sized pans and was very reasonable.  We drove the 25 minutes to find it and our order was ready.   Soup was more like Special Wonton and LoMein and other dishes above were all very good.  Staff was a little sparse on Sweet n Sour Sauce, but we weren't feeling well so didn't feel like asking for more.

There is a very clean taste to the chicken broth. Peas, carrots, and corn are also added. The workers are friendly and prompt with service. We also order home delivery which is also very prompt.

322237,VtijFjOivt54_AscgTIBPw,Bpp8unXZmbyxSZS7D93Jog,"I came here initially when I was in the area visiting a friend.  I had been looking for an American Chinese restaurant since moving to Vegas this past summer, and after trying about five other places, this has been by far the best. Now please be aware, this is not authentic Chinese food. If you are looking for that type of food, I would recommend taking a gander around Chinatown. What this is is phenomenal American Chinese food (think Panda Express-type food, but not sickening). 

The past two times I've gone, I've ordered the lemon chicken, the pork and green beans, the beef and green beans, the moo shu pork, the fired rice, lo mein, crab rangoons, and the eggrolls. In my defense, a majority of the food is a part of the $7 combo special, which gives you SO MUCH FOOD. That's another thing: the prices are phenomenal, and the portions are so big! The pork in the sting bean combo was a bit dry, but the beef was so good. Like, the best American Chinese beef I've hand in a long time. Also, the string beans are so very good. Nice and crunchy, and covered with a delicious sauce. The pork fried rice that comes with the combo is also better than the lo mein, but the lo mein is also really good. The moo shu pork was also great, but I wish they would have given me more wrapers because they gave me so much of it even for the small (which was only $6). 

The service was also really great. The service was attentive, and the place was really clean. Tiled floor to ceiling, but I'm not really expecting much from the decor of a strip-mall American Chinese place. That being said, the service review might be a little biased, since my friend and I were the only people actually sitting down in the restaurant, but other people came in and got take out, so they obviously thought the food was something to try.  

If this is the kind of Chinese food you're looking for, I would definitely recommend Chop Chop Wok. While it is definitely not the best American Chinese food I've ever had (I grew up in Oakland, and went to college in LA), I personally think that it's the best I've had since moving to Vegas. Check it out, I doubt you'll be disappointed.",5

I loved their crab Ragoon which they didn't over fry as most places do. The service was OK and it wasn't crowded I did see that a lot of the orders are for pick up so maybe that's why you don't see a lot of people inside the restaurant.",4

I ordered the Szechuan trio which was chicken, scallops, and shrimp.  It was good but it wasn't very spicy.  I need to ask for extra spice when I order.  I got garlic chicken for my wife.  It, too, was good but there wasn't much of a garlic flavor.  There were some cut up fresh garlic in the stir fry that didn't have much taste at all.

We each got a cup of soup--me hot and sour and wonton for my wife.  These were the standouts of my order.  We also got two complimentary egg rolls.  They give one with a purchase of a certain amount and I guess since we got two dinners, we got two egg rolls.

For $6 you get the meal, egg roll & choice of rice & choice of soup (even for to go!) They also have an entire healthy steamed section with wide array of veggies & choice of meat or tofu & I love having a healthy option!  The only reason I dropped a star, is that the storefront is tiny with just a few tables, so you basically must get your food delivered or to go.

Lemon chicken is spot-on in flavor, and perfectly crispy because they poked holes in the box lid. Good attention to detail!

Moo Shu pork is decent but not my favorite dish, served with pancakes that are reminiscent of tortillas. Healthy-seeming dish with lots of cabbage, mushrooms, and other veggies. Menu also offers steamed veggie and protein options for those seeking healthy choices.

But the won ton soup. Lord. The $5 bowl is huge, has 6 plump and stuffed won tons, but the broth is the star! Perfectly savory, probably packed with MSG, topped with a ton of shredded green onion. Perfect when you're under the weather.",4

We had the crab & cheese wontons (delicious), Mongolian chicken and shrimp fried rice. Everything was good (didn't know the chicken came with white rice, so we had extra rice).

So I walk in and look over my options. Their theme here is Chinese/Thai fusion. I see that they have lunch specials which is always good for peeps like me who appreciates decent food at decent prices. If you refer to my pic, the lunch specials are from open to 4 pm everyday. Choose an item from the list along with either Lo Mein, Steamed Rice, or Fried Rice. You also have an extra side option from a Vegetable Egg Roll, Cream Cheese Won Tons, or Soup (Egg Drop, Hot n Sour or Won Ton).

I went with the Orange Chicken (typical right?), Fried Rice, and Hot n Sour Soup from the 5.75 list. Keep in mind a drink is not included but I got water and it was definitely from their tap.

First off, I gotta say that the Hot n Sour Soup was excellent! Not too salty or bland and enough ingredients to round out the taste. It was steaming hot!

As for the entree, the Orange Chicken was crispy and the orange tang to it was good. Only thing I noticed was that some of contents could of been more consistent meat portion instead of extra batter.

Now for the Fried Rice. Wow. No, not the good kind of wow. The what the heck just happened wow. The Fried Rice was not the typical fried rice I was used to. There was like nothing in it. You know like peas, carrots, onions, etc. It seemed like they put a couple drops of soy sauce and mixed in a quarter of an egg. It didnt have much flavor to it. 

Total I paid was $6.20 including tax. I left a dollar tip on the table for the service was ok.   If it wasnt for the Hot n Sour Soup being so good, this would of easily been 2 stars. At least the the above mentioned was edible. Maybe next time I will just go with a large bowl of soup. Either that or risk trying another entree in hopes that the cook was just having a bad day at the time. Either way, I will update accordingly.

I had the Pad Thai lunch special and it is nice that they use breast meat. I thought that it was too sweet and it is weird that it comes with rice. The fried rice is not great. Not bad tasting, just plain and not worth eating, really.   The service was very friendly.",3

We also had the general chicken, orange chicken and chillimint chicken.  All of it was wonderful.  No heavy soggy batter just nice and crispy.  The delivery guy was pretty quick and very polite.

Nelson and Sylvia Q. had been here before, so they suggested some of the dishes that we ordered.  I can't say there was a loser in the bunch but I liked some better than others.

The spicy shrimp were good but they weren't spicy.  There were some jalapeño slices on top but there was no  spiciness to the shrimp themselves.  The crispy Gau gee was a winner!  What great flavor in that fried goodness.  We mixed the Chinese mustard with soy and dipped the Gau gee in that.  Great!  The pressed Almond duck was another winner.  I love duck and this was great!  The Kow yuk - pork belly - was very good and was not as sweet as the look of the sauce suggested.  Putting a thick slab of the pork belly in a bao and eating was very tasty.

Having heard things both interesting and exciting about Wo Fat and its Hawaiian influenced Chinese cuisine but not yet able to coax a large enough group to make the visit worthwhile it was with great fortune that following donuts I not only managed to gather five co-diners to experience the small East side restaurant, but that two of the folks involved were already familiar with not only Wo Fat from a prior visit, but also the restaurant's style from their years in Hawaii.  Located in a less than ideal location and not particularly attractive from the outside or within it should suffice to say that a visit to Wo Fat is based more on the food than the ambiance but with service friendly and efficient throughout the off-hour it was with tea and water that the meal began, soon to be followed by a half dozen menu selections - most novel, all well prepared, and a few truly outstanding.  Sampling far and wide with suggestions from everyone including our server it was with plethoric portion that each dish arrived and with both the pork and shrimp stuffed kau gee as well as the beef chow funn excellent while cake noodles and shrimp were commendable if not memorable it was in the pork and the duck that the meal truly shined - the former a complex sort of mild char sui with more aromatics and less sugar proving irresistible on soft bao while the later was simply divine, a tender confit of duck beneath crackling almond paste that added just a touch of sweetness for a mere $9.95.",4
336451,6yIqfQQPF4cDRXFqSx84wA,4ZuYJjjFrqgyDEeYoizyIw,"I was determined to visit Wo Fat because of its Hawaiian-style Chinese cuisine. For that reason, it wasn't difficult to convince my family to come with me. We all loved and constantly crave the Chinese dishes from our past. Although I have come to love the Chinese cuisine offered in Las Vegas, it's just not the same. Anyway, the real reason I wanted to come? Four words: Crispy Gau Gee Mein. We ALWAYS ordered it at our favorite Chinese restaurant in Hawaii and it's been over a decade since I've had it! 

It was quite the drive for us (as is most places) and we were starving by the time we arrived. It's a small restaurant with just 3-4 large round tables and approximately 10 small booths. Fortunately, one of the large groups were leaving, so we didn't need to wait long for a table (there's really no where to wait except outside).

With five of us dining, we shared Lo Mein, Shrimp & Broccoli in Black Bean Sauce, Chicken Chow Mein, Combination Fried Rice, Kung Pao Chicken, Mapu Tofu, and two orders of Crispy Gau Gee Mein (substituted with Cake Noodles). All the dishes, with the exception of the Lo Mein (I didn't try it) and Crispy Gau Gee Mein, were only okay. The Chow Mein and Kung Pao Chicken were terrible. The Fried Rice has a very distinct flavor that really took me back to my youth, however, the quality left something to be desired. The Black Bean Shrimp and Tofu dishes were better than the rest of the group, but nothing great. 

The Crispy Gau Gee Mein, on the other hand, YUM. The Gau Gee is perfect..exactly how I remember eating it in Hawaii!! Crispy exterior with delicious, moist pork interior. So good. The vegetables, gravy, and noodles were harmonious. It's a popular dish and I absolutely recommend it. Although, it is a damn shame that it doesn't just come with cake noodles since that's the best way to eat this dish (don't forget the additional charge).

Oddly, the rice wasn't very tasty either. My favorite part of receiving steamed rice at Chinese restaurants is the delicious, fragrant Jasmine rice. Their rice seemed like it was just a long grain white rice, but my parents thought it was an inferior Jasmine rice. Either way, not yummy and disappointing.

Service was nothing spectacular and there were young children running in and out of the kitchen. Not very professional or sanitary. Nevertheless, we all thoroughly enjoyed the Crispy Gau Gee Mein, but it was unanimous that a second visit would be unlikely. If I'm ever in the area, I may consider a takeout order for it though.",3

The reason I would come back here :

Pressed Almond Duck. This was VERY good. It is served boneless and has lots of flavor combined with the slightly sweet almond topping. The highlight of my meal!

Beef Chow Funn in Black Bean Sauce. This was pretty good! Tender beef with a nice flavorful noodle and sauce. Yum :)

Spicy Shrimp in Shell aka Salt & Pepper Shrimp. These were what you would expect, just not spicy at all. Good version of this dish. 

Kow Yuk (Pork Belly) served with Bao. This was tender and flavorful, but not sweet or sour like the color may suggest. It was good but did not impress me as much as my lunch mates. 

Crispy Kau Chee. Filled with a meat combination...similar to a crispy wonton of sorts.  Not bad.

Crispy Kau Chee Mein with Pork, Shrimp & Veggies. This was ok. Decent flavor but it was not extraordinary. 

Good Chinese spot in town, but I wouldn't travel across town for it again personally.",4

First time ever for me so I can't say whether or not it's better than others, but I liked it very much. Ordered General Tso's chicken...it's my standard for how good the chef is...excellently done. The vegetable chow mein was tasty but the noodles were over cooked. The mu shu chicken rivals what PF Chang used to serve, so I now have my place for getting mu shu.  Just make sure you review your order with the waitress before you let her go. They were very accommodating and checked a few time to make sure everything was ok. The reason for the three stars is because ambience is non existent. So go for the food and take home the leftovers...or order carry out. It'll be worth it.",3
336459,EoXQkGHXhwe-0qE256j93Q,4ZuYJjjFrqgyDEeYoizyIw,"Skimming through my Facebook news feed was a very effective way to get this place on my radar. One of my high school classmates checked into this place and captioned it with, ""Hawaiian Style Chinese food."" From that point on, I was sold. It wasn't too far from my house and my body was telling me it was time to eat. As I researched this place on my Yelp app, I realized that this place sold cake noodles, a dish reminiscent of my childhood days. Boy was I excited.

This place is located on the corner of  Desert Inn and Sandhill, which means from the 95, you'll have to take Flamingo or the Boulder cutoff and travel down Sandhill. This restaurant sits in a shopping center full of mediocre businesses, not too exciting of a location. When you enter, you think very outdated. Booths and round tables with lazy Susans tell you this place needs a renovation and fast! What calmed my initial nerves was the fact that they do their best to hold the Chinese traditions AND seem to cater to the Hawaiian population. Hawaiian drinks, signs with ""Aloha"" and ""Mahalo"" display their windows and counters. Did I really hit the jackpot?? When talking with the employees, the young lady said her uncle has a Wo Fat restaurant in Honolulu and this is another location. The staff was super nice. Even though I ordered my food to go, she still offered water to me. The food also came very quickly. Speaking of which, here's what I got:

Crispy Gau Chee Mein with cake noodles for around $10: THE REASON that brought me here and the reason that will keep me coming back! As a base you have the delicious cake noodles that remind me of my childhood. Crispy noodles cut into cake squares, topped with Gau Chee, oyster sauce and lots of different flavors and textures: char siu pork, shrimp, chicken, broccoli, Chinese peas, water chestnuts and mushrooms. WOW, what an array of flavors! So delicious and something I highly recommend! The cake noodle managed to maintain is crispiness, even with the oyster sauce. I was in heaven.

Kow Yok for $9.25: Kind of weird that they spell it like this. In Hawaii, it's referred to as Kau Yuk. Whatever the spelling, it's basically pork belly cooked and flavored with a fermented red bean curd. PLEASE BE ADVISED, this is a super marbleized dish. The fat can be very over powering for many, so don't order it if you're not into that. For me, it's what I grew up with! The flavor was just right. The pork had a good combination of fat/meat ratio. 

Crispy Gau Chee order (6) for $6.25: Another form of spelling I'm not used to. In Hawaii it's Cripsy Gau Gee. Basically pork stuffed won ton rectangles and deep fried, served with a spicy mustard and soy dipping sauce. This was ON POINT! Perfectly cook, super crispy and the port was flavored well. Add in the mustard sauce and you've got a side dish fit for a king! You definitely have to try this if you come!

Oyster Chicken for $8.95: Roasted chicken topped with an oyster flavored sauce. I thought the sauce was great and really helped to enhance this dish. My only gripe about this dish was the cut of chicken. It's Chinese style and cut like a roasted duck dish, meaning the cut bones and all. Although this is a Chinese restaurant, I don't necessarily think it's a Hawaiian style dish. What I'm used to is boneless, breaded and fried chicken with the oyster sauce drizzle. The flavor was good, but for some reason I wasn't as crazy about this dish as I was about the others. 

FINALLY! A Chinese restaurant that reminds me of home! There are a lot of Chinese joints in Las Vegas, none like this. The cake noodles alone are reason to come back. Add the crispy gau chee and I've officially found my new favorite joint! On my next visit, I'm getting the cold ginger chicken. I can't wait for that day to come. Thanks so much for the awesome food!",4
336460,_XGqr2aD53KtDZO3DsB5zQ,4ZuYJjjFrqgyDEeYoizyIw,"Being from Hawaii we decided to try this place we were so disappointed the fried won ton was like mini gau gee without the meat.  the duck was greasy and mostly fat, the beef brocolli cake noodles lacking and manapua really?  maybe it was an off day but I do not think I would go again.",1
336461,WmBiX1dKrh5Z1jln3nHxow,4ZuYJjjFrqgyDEeYoizyIw,"Mmmmm came here at the recommendation of a friend who said it's just like the food back home in Hawaii. I looked on yelp to check out the pictures and to see what people where saying and then drove down to place a order. 

It's smaller than the Chinese places back home but it has that cozy kind of feeling. I ordered the minute chicken with cake noodle. I wish that it doesn't cost extra for the cake noodle but it did, stir fry Chinese broccoli and the sample appetizer. 

Mmmmm the minute chicken came noodle was so good. They separated the sauce so the cake noodle would to get soggy on the drive home. The only thing I was disappointed in was that it seemed like there was more cake noodle than chicken & veggie, but other than that it was delicious. 

The Chinese broccoli was the bomb. Not too soggy and not too hard. Just perfect crispness. 

The appetizer was alright. The BBQ pork had sesame seed on it which is alright but since I don't like it and wasn't expecting it I had to scrape it all off but it was still good. The only thing I didn't like was the gau gee. There was barely any meat and was only skin. 

All in all it was very delicious and I will definitely be back. They had a location on hotel street in Hawaii and have their menu posted on the wall 

I noticed a lot of people commented in the customer service and being that this was my first time there, I had good service. The woman who took my order was super friendly and helpful.",4
336462,Wuwy49zPoZP9kZiyW0tCjA,4ZuYJjjFrqgyDEeYoizyIw,"After a failed hunt for manapua, a friend suggested that maybe I check out Wo Fat since it was basically on my way home. It took me a little while to find it because I didn't exactly know where I was going. 
When I went in, there were several large groups seated but I knew I was going to get my order to-go, so I stepped right up to the counter. I ordered the minute chicken with cake noodle because I hadn't had any good cake noodle since leaving Hawaii in January because I couldn't find any. The manapua would have to wait till another day. 
The ordering process was easy. Then came the long wait. And I mean LONG. You would think something with a name like minute chicken wouldn't take very long. But it was almost half an hour before I got my order. There wasn't a place for you to wait for a take-out order, so I basically stood on the side near the restrooms pretty much staring at the blown up articles they had on the walls. 
Once I got home, I realized that I needed to put the sauce on the noodles, which I thought was a good thing. (Even if I do like the sauce making the noodles soft and mushy.) I let it sit for a little while and went to do something else. When I went back to my food, I saw that it really wasn't a very big portion for the $10 I paid. It barely covered the bottom of a styrofoam container. It was a little disappointing. But the food wasn't bad. It was tasty and the cake noodle was similar to ones I've had previously. 
I don't think I'll be going back anytime soon, though. It wasn't worth the price I paid and I think I could have gotten more for my money somewhere else. But at least I got cake noodle. That was the one bright spot.",3
336463,1x-T9ef9ArQ37SF0U7zWGQ,4ZuYJjjFrqgyDEeYoizyIw,"From the reviews, we had to try the crispy kau chee, cold ginger chicken, and almond pressed duck. All delicious. The spot itself gave a SF hole in the wall feel that we like. Don't order the wine unless you like your wine sweet. Do get the salted duck egg and mix with your rice for added salty goodness. Worth the trip from the southside!",4
336464,E9FIB2AlCdeJ-k9z88Qdug,4ZuYJjjFrqgyDEeYoizyIw,"this place you strictly go for the food , not the atmosphere or service because quite frankly they are both a little scary in the normal world . The chinese food here is beyond YUM , it is Hawaii style and we have come here for years , its totally in the hood but so worth the drive . we get the crispy kau gee every time , the minute chicken and cake noodles is my favorite and the deep friend short ribs I think it is ?? the menu has alot of things but this is all i have tried I know what i like !!",4
336465,Gfvw2Q-fM5DoY89d87hQJQ,4ZuYJjjFrqgyDEeYoizyIw,"Was here for lunch again on 8/24/14.  Still very good.  Did the ownership change?  Maybe a new cook?  The food tasted a little different (but still good), and the presentation style of the dishes were also different.  But I still think that for ""Hawaiian Style"" Cantonese food, this place is very good.  And the prices have gone up a bit, but still very good.  For those of you who are interested this is what we ordered: 4 orders of crispy gau gee, one order of beef brocolli/cake noodle. one order beef gailan/cake noodle, fishcake with veggies, spicy eggplant with pork, kau yuk, pot roast chicken, harm har ong choi, and one other dish that escape my memory right now.  The purpose of listing all the dishes is to let you know that all these dishes were very good.  We ordered extra since my son drove home immediately to LA and took the leftovers with him.",4

I've heard this place is a hotspot for Hawaiian locals living in Vegas  who miss the good chinese food back home. This resto does remind me of the chinese restos back home in hawaii and the food is the same too which is great. We had the Beef with Vegetable Chow Mein ($9.95), Wonton Soup ($6.95), and General Tsao's Chicken ($9.99). The wonton soup was good. The Chow Mein was ok but Im glad they ask your preference if you want the sauce on the side (dry style) or wet. The chicken was best thing we ate. It was a little sweet and little spicy with a bed of steamed broccoli. I've tried this place before and had their oxtail soup and beef with bitter melon which were great.  I love coming here for the nostalgia of Hawaiian style Chinese food and will definitely come back to try their other dishes.",5

The first time I went I knew it would be good because not only can you see the kitchen and see how everything is freshly made per order, the chef is an older Chinese guy, so I knew it would be authentic. The younger guy who takes your order is super nice and has a great understanding of customer service. I'm so happy I now have my go to Chinese in Vegas! Thanks Beijing!",5
338653,b7ip-ZDoGUBSDandh0_jmA,5kOYuJtRjAUWZGDkP8vnRw,"TWO OUT OF THREE AIN'T BAD

   In recent times, I have dining here three times and in Christmas Day 2012 for lunch. I have sampled three entrees: shrimp with lobster sauce, pepper steak, and spicy eggplant. Two of the three entrees were delicious and one was ok. The shrimp with lobster sauce was delicious. The next time I eat here, it will most likely be the dish that I order. For the record this is the first Chinese restaurant that I recall in Vegas where the shrimp based entrees are the exact price as the other entrees. The pepper steak was also delicious. But the shrimp with lobster sauce was better, in my opinion. However, the spicy eggplant was ok. It could have been softer and tastier. Two entrees tasting delicious out of three ain't bad.

  The lunch special is a good deal that ends at 3 pm. The specials go for $5.95. As I wrote, they included shrimp based entrees that are usually 50 cents more at the competition. The lunch specials include white rice, corn soup or hot and sour soup, and an egg roll of the spring roll variety. A cold beverage increases the lunch special to $8 before the tip. 

  As an observant yelper I notice a couple of things. The portions are smaller than the competition, however, there is none of the filler chow mien noodles that some restaurants fill half the plate with. This is the only Chinese restaurant where fried rice or brown rice is missing from the luncheon special. I could eat white rice as long as it has soy sauce on it. Its just that fried rice and brown rice are far tastier and when I go out to eat in a Chinese restaurant, I prefer the tastiest rice.

  Beijing Chinese Restaurant is in the Eastern Be ltway Shopping Center. It is away from the Walmart madness but very close to the Eastern Avenue madness right off the Interstate 215 exit.

  I rate Beijing Chinese Restaurant 3 stars, equivalent to a ""B."" I'd like to conclude this review with a tip. If you catch the lunch special save your appetite for the German Bakery nextstore.",3
338654,vOPMgvcz-4rOdENcsmAxAQ,5kOYuJtRjAUWZGDkP8vnRw,This is the best Chinese food I've had in a long time. The regular menu prices are reasonable and the lunch specials are amazing. My husband and I eat here as often as we can. I definitely recommend this to anyone.,5

The orange chicken is also very good, if you like spicy chicken get the spicy fried chicken!  It's crispy yet chewy, great texture.  The fried cheese wontons and the dumplings are classic, you can't go wrong with this place.

They deliver as well!  Be sure to ask for the free soda is you order delivery!",5

I was very pleasantly surprised to find that this place had fantastic service and the food was good without the overwhelming portions of rice and/or chow main a lot of places shove into a Styrofoam box.  
We had real plates and cutlery and both the cashew chicken and Kung Pao chicken had fresh ingredients with great flavor. We really enjoyed the egg rolls, which also tasted fresh.  The chicken and corn soup aka egg drop soup was the only negative. It was flavorless. Adding hot mustard, salt, and pepper helped, but not enough to make it worth it.

All in all, I wil definitely return to this spot when running errands  on Eastern during lunch.",4

Maybe 'Jajangmyeon' but that isn't the name on the menu
I know (now) that the spicy seafood soup is really featured and I will definitely try that if we get back here.
The presentation was cool, a large bowl of noodles and the sauce with shrimp in a separate bowl.  Our server mixed it in front of me.  She seemed pretty happy that I ordered it.  The bean sauce was a little less seasoned than I expected, but it was very good.

Eileen had her usual- orange chicken, and it was certainly not overcooked, but could have been hotter.

Overall, very good!",4

Fried rice tasted like white rice.  The beef and mushrooms were flavorless.  Sesame chicken was average.  Smallest egg roll I've ever seen.  Very small portions for what you pay.  I've had better food at panda express sadly to say.  Yelp failed me on this one.  Lots of other chinese spots to try before Id ever go back here.,1

Garlic Chicken was white meat and an incredible amount of chicken with just the right amount of garlic.

The rice was perfect; sticky as it comes!

The chips served at the outset were crispy and fresh, not oily.

We Yelped and Beijing Chinese popped up not too far from us. We arrived and were seated by a friendly Chinese lady. It was pretty dead except for one other table. We ordered hot tea, chicken fried rice, house special chicken, chicken with veggies, dumplings, lo mein noodles. $43 and change. 
The food was pretty good, the sauce on the house special was a tad salty although she marketed it as spicy-sweet, as well as lo mein was a pinch on the salty, but I'm salt sensitive, so someone else may disagree. 
I'll admit my love of Chinese is pretty wishy-washy, it's not my favorite choice, this food is up there with regular Chinese.",4

The Cashew Chicken was great! They didn't skimp on the cashews, like most places do and they weren't soggy either, like they often can be when ordering delivery. Their Cashew Chicken was colorful and consisted of baby corn, chunky bell peppers (both red and green) and onions, carrots & water chestnuts. I would definitely order the Cashew Chicken again. 

A side note: be careful with the spice when you order! I ordered ""extra spicy"" on this dish and it was hot as hell! I loved it but I don't think many could handle that level of spiciness. It was borderline too spicy for me and when it comes to spice tolerance, I'm certifiably insane! So I'd say their scales of hotness are on track with where they should be. You never know with some places. In some restaurants in order to get something extra spicy you have to order EXTRA extra spicy, so I thought it was worth taking a stab at deciphering this restaurant's spicy scale for all the other spice whores out there.

My only disappointment was with the Tom Kha soup because it was a little sweeter than I would have liked. It was still good though. I just probably wouldn't order it again.

I'd say that Thai House is deserving of a little higher than their current 3.5 star rating so I'm going to round up to 4 stars and give them that. I liked my dinner enough to keep them in mind when ordering Thai in the future.",4

On some occasions we choose to dine in the restaurant...when you have a little extra time to spare its nice to sit in their dining room. The waitresses all wear traditional costume which accentuates your Thai dining experience. The waitstaff are all very personable too.
We have had the pleasure of traveling to Thailand...and the food that we eat at Thai House is very authentic...and transports your taste buds back to those days of dining on the beaches of Phuket. 
Some of our favorites are Tom Kha,Tom Yum, Pad Thai, Pad Kee Mao, Sweet Chili Chicken, Red Chicken Curry, Basil Fried Rice, Chicken Chili Mint, Ginger Chicken, Cashew Chicken,Thai tea, and the list goes on...
I've ordered online and over the phone. I've never had a challenge with my order being incorrect...sometimes a few minutes late...but so very worth it!!! We've ordered from Thai House so much that its a warm welcome to see their delivery driver at our door!!!

This came pretty close and I'm thankful they understand my Lao! Haha! I came here with co-workers this last Sunday and it was a good choice. The papaya salad was a little sweeter than what I'm used to but they scale the spicy for the papaya from 1-10...I asked for 12...I felt like it was an 8. I make all this stuff myself at home so I know what a 12 is...it's the kind that burns your fingertips before you put it in your mouth! Haha! I really like spicy! 

Anyway...I ordered Papaya salad, larb moo (pork), and Thai BBQ chicken and sticky rice. Everything tasted great!...but the only reason why I couldn't give them a 5 star is because the portion of sticky rice they served for $2.50 was like a smack in the face for someone who is Laotian! That is the mini handful size I gave to my kids when they were 5!!! C'mon man!!! On top of that the texture of it was as if it has been reheated at least once. It had a super hard center and was wrapped in Saran Wrap to re-steam. Uh-uh! No!

Not only do they have outstanding service but the food is always on point and the live music on Friday/Saturday night is quite enjoyable. As you walk in the staff are always right there to greet you and when not busy, able to seat you right away. For starters I always order the Pad Thai Noodles. Which has a small peanut taste but is also a bit tangy and spicy. It comes with your choice of meat such as chicken, beef, or shrimp. For my main course I always get the Penang Curry, again you have your choice of chicken, beef, or shrimp. This coconut curry dish is served with your choice of white rice, which is the way to go but if you wanna be a tad bit healthy, then you can go with the brown rice. This dish regularly comes out pretty spicy so my advice to you not so spicy lovers, make sure you request it at a level three on their scale of one thru ten. Overall I think all the food here is great, the two dishes I mentioned are always my go to meals especially on a cold nigh out. The prices are pretty decent compared to other thai restaurants in Las Vegas an Henderson. If you're looking for good food and wanting to venture out and try anything other than a burger and fries, why not enjoy the delicious thai quinine at the Thai House. I promise you won't be disappointed.",5

339017,0Imr_WFvgkz3fmINlzsgOg,lzoTXcynmfZ6Ler5B4HbfQ,"The food at this restaurant is decent, however the staff (including the people that own the restaurant) are horrible. I have ordered food for delivery MANY times and the online service says it will take 45 min to a hour which is fine but I have never received it in less than an hour and a half! So I usually accommodate for this and order way before I am hungry, tonight I ordered food at 5:15 and it was not delivered to my house until 7:38. When I called the first time to ask where my food was the woman that answered was very rude and told me she would figure it out then she hung up on me! I called again 10 min later (which was around 7:20) and asked to speak to the owner, the owner then said she was sorry and would call the driver and then in turn hung up on me! So these people had the nerve to hang up on a paying customer twice! They also did not offer me anything, no discounts or money back for bringing my food hours late. This is the only thai place in my area that delivers but honestly I would rather drive to the other end of the city and eat before I ordered here again.",1
339018,TZyxPfsNxH1Vc-e8jKKWOA,lzoTXcynmfZ6Ler5B4HbfQ,"The only redeeming qualities this place has is the delivery (and even that sucks most of the time) and the fact that they carry a food my husband loves. 

We've ordered from here a number of times, with varying levels of satisfaction. Here are the main issues that keep repeating themselves:

-After I had my daughter, my ability to handle spicy food lowered dramatically. As such, I order everything as mild as possible. I understand that Thai food is spicy, but ""mild"" shouldn't be so spicy that I can't even eat it. This happens more often than not, and it seems to depend on who is doing the cooking. 

-They rarely deliver the right things/everything. We've received parts of other people's orders, and we often don't receive all of our order. 

-The food is substandard and overpriced.",2

The last few times we have waited over an hour after the estimated time. The last time we called we sat on hold for an extended period. When we finally got an answer, we were told we could not order. I guess they are doing so well, they don't need the money! Never again will we order from them!",1

Large portions for a good price and I will be going back soon to sample other menu items.

Tom Kha soup - insanely good. Hands down the best soup I've ever had in my life. You'll want to pour it all over yourself, it's just incredible. I get it at a level 5 out of 10. 

The only reason for a 4 rating vs 5 is because of their beef dishes - they taste strange to me, but take that with a grain of salt as I am not an avid red meat fan. 

Tom Kha soup. Seriously. Do it.",4

I usually order between $15 and $25 for one order. Today I was buying food for my family to be delivered and spent about double that. For $50 including tip, I expect good food and the same level of customer service I would get as if I was sitting in the restaurant. 

I ordered the beef and meatball soup with large flat noodles like I always do. And like always I ask that they exclude the beef syrups and instead add more meatballs. It's never been a problem until today. 

When my order arrived I got two orders of half meatball soups with some type of noodle I didn't ask for. When I called to confirm, I was given the run around and asked that the owner or manager call me back. I was told that the order was a mistake by the girl on the phone but I shouldve only paid $5 per order of soup because it was minus the beef strips. Wrong. I was charged full price. 

When I relayed these issues to the owner I was courteous and let him know that the food was always good but that my order wasn't how I normally receive it. He informed me that I had been wrong for close to four years and that they had been screwing up orders for that amount of time as they price is the same whether I order with or without beef strips. 

Odd that all of a sudden when I have an issue has everything been wrong all these years. 

Customer service was lacking and so shall my business. 

I shouldve ordered the pizza instead.",1

The place had lots of empty tables at dinner time. We placed a to-go order and waited a few minutes. We got fried tofu, beef Thai spicy salad, sweet and sour chicken and Thai iced tea.

Fried Tofu:
Average and nothing special which is a shame because I love tofu. The peanut sauce was bland and super runny. 1/5

Beef Thai Spicy Salad:
Thin slices of beef on a bed of unchopped/ unshredded lettuce, carrots, cucumbers, and I asked for no onions. It was as if it was too damn tideous to chop lettuce! The dressing was pretty good - a little sweet and spicy and you can choose on the spicy level from 1-10. 3/5

Sweet and Sour Chicken:
The worst thing to order but this is what my friend wanted. He ate a few pieces until he noticed a very bloody piece of chicken. Seriously, that is plain gross. Salmonella!!! Which reminds me, I should probably check if my friend has puked his brains out. 1/5...make that -5/5

Why even bother running a restaurant if you can't even do the basics? Chopping lettuce and you know, cooking chicken. Salmonella: lose 9lbs in 3 days or your money back! Pad See EEEEEWWWW!!!",1

Anyway, whether you like meat or tofu this place is delicious. The spicy garlic shrimp was amazing. My friends cashew lemon was sweet (so realistically not my thing). The tofu is firm which for me is a must. 

Always checking on your table to refill your glass. They did just change their menu though. They went from a wonderfully nice menu that was large and leather-like, to just little lamented menus you would find at a cheap place. Don't let it fool you. It's still good. 

Lastly though, I wish they would change their fish tank. I swear the fish in there are too big for the tank. It makes me sad to look at.",4

Like how the large soups are served in the hot pot with sterno so it doesn't get lukewarm. Lots of veggies & flavor. 
Can't comment on their meat dishes but they can make some great vegan Thai food - pad Thai, Pad Kee Mow, & the curries (red, green & panang) are my faves. 
I also appreciate that takeout doesn't come in styrofoam cups - I hate those.
There is a stage, but I've never seen any entertainment. It is large enough to accommodate a large group, unlike some of my fave hole-in-the wall places.",4

1. Pad thai beef, 10.95
2. Spicy eggplant mint with fried tofu, 10.95
3. Yellow Curry, 10.95

- We came in a little before 9. Seated right away. Ordered food within 5 min. 
- Excellent service. Upbeat. Smiley. Didn't have to ask for water refills, to-go boxes, or a check. 
- Boring menu. Aren't these To-Go?
- Nice presentation of foods. Fancy utensils, napkins, place mat, and plating. 
- Food came fresh all at the same time.
- Food came with steamed rice. Came in a decorative bowl. I've been been many Asian restaurants, and not many Thai restaurants in Vegas put their rice in this kind of bowl. It's usually in a tiny rice bowl. 
-  Spice rack looked nice. 
- Yellow curry: Chicken was a bit hard. Potatoes and carrots cut nicely. Thick and well-flavored curry. 
- Pad Thai: Good. Not too sweet. 
- Spicy eggplant: Inconsistently cut eggplant. Some were raw others were well done. A little disappointing. 
 - No karaoke on a Friday night? haha. 
- Definitely would want to try their lunch specials!",4

This place has been around for awhile and hasn't disappointed each time we come here.  The location is a bit hidden, tucked way back in the corner of the Smith's shopping center.  Each time we come in, I have never seen it packed either lunch or dinner.  The place is roomy and has a stage for live music.  We were seated promptly and our service was excellent.  I didn't have to sit with an empty water glass for long and the food arrived quickly, A+ on service.  After searching in Henderson for a good Fresh roll, I may have found it here at the Thai house.  I highly recommend them!   I also had some Orange Chicken and some Moo Poo Gai Chicken which were both very good.  In the past, I've had some of their fried rices and sometimes they can be hit or miss, I usually like these from elsewhere.  The soups are amazing here,  I really enjoy their Egg Drop, very tasty.  

An order of Orange Chicken, Moo Poo Gai Chicken, Fresh Rolls (4), a small Cucumber Salad and an Egg Drop soup (all of this food wasn't all just for me, I swear!  :P) ran about 36 bucks.

You could order an item one night, and have an excellent experience, and order the same exact item the very next night ( which ive done several times), and be disappointed.

Basically the only thing they didn't eat was the snout and the asshole, and I'm not even sure about the later. 
    So upon moving here we decided we wanted some good, old fashioned Americanized Chinese food and boy did we find it with Chopstix! The General Tso's chicken and Happy family sure made this family happy. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra few bucks for the extra meat and noodles instead of rice. Everything was delicious and both times we have stuffed ourselves silly (and had plenty for the beloved leftovers the next day). 
    Unlike the authentic Chinese restaurants back home who (oddly) didn't deliver, Chopstix had our food to us hot, fresh and in about 25 minutes. I might note that we found the delivery fee to be pretty steep at 3.50$, but maybe that is the norm here. Either way, it was worth it to us and it won't deter us from ordering (although maybe from ordering as frequently). 
    All in all, a great place. We look forward to ordering again soon.",5

341448,9gRthk6s50zKRRBSL3WiEQ,vh9CQdZj-1N21kW0qgKmnQ,"Lunch deal is pretty ace. We tried one broccoli beef, and one chicken w/garlic. Meats were succulent, but chopped much too large; vegetables were present but not super flavorful; white rice and fried rice were modest and acceptable. Everything came out piping hot, in generous portions.

The girl behind the counter was cute aside from pinky-picking at her nose and not covering a sneeze (ahem); the guy behind the counter was helpful aside from being a bit hard to understand and not covering his coughs (ahem); the cockroach behind the counter crawling down the wall was harmless aside from being a cockroach (ahem). I'm not sure if these things will stop me from ever going back when in the mood for cheap Chinese.

So in the end: it's the embodiment of a hole-in-the-wall Chinese joint. If you go in expecting that, then I guess it's fine. If you don't, then you might wanna adjust the score down accordingly.",3

Today was cockroach day, apparently, as we saw more of them than we've seen there before. As for the food, it's about as good as ever, but when asked to cut the too-large pieces of beef into a more single-bite size, they didn't really do that today. To top it off, they recently changed their drink selections from what we usually got, and it's not like you can lower the price on the lunch special if you just say no drink. I want this to be a comfort food, but today was all about making me less comfortable.

I guess I'll still return to them when I'm craving some cheap Chinese, but this visit was a disappointment.",2

There were no less than 200 roaches. Live and dead. Counter. Walls. Floors. Moving. Not moving. It was like being in a Roach snow globe. I asked them twice what the deal was and they just had the ""I no understand"" face. Purely disgusting. I had to find a clean place to put the bag.

NY style chow mein was great.  We got chicken and roast pork chow mein.  Napa cabbage celery onions lots of chicken and crispy noodles on the side. They also came with a pint of rice with each.  The roast pork had lots of slices of roast pork.  

None of this west coast lo mein calling itself chow mein.  And there was enough for 2-3 meals! 

 Hubby got sweet and sour chicken with a mound of fried rice.  The sauce was on the side so it didnt get mushy in the container.  The egg rolls were egg rolls and not little greasy spring rolls.  And nothing was greasy.

It was delivered hot and fresh in less than an hour, just as stated

Only problem was I thought my chow mein needed more garlic.  Pop said his was fine.

We will be ordering from here again!!",5

It's a real pleasant surprise when some one is helpful and pays attention to you.. But it was all down hill after that.. The delivery time was acceptable no where near fast but not slow by any means.. I requested that the delivery driver call me when he gets at my home, due to me being upstairs and i have a bad knee so I'm not fast down the stairs. I am startled by all the dogs in the house freaking out because the driver was pounding on my door.. Almost breaking my neck running down stairs i go answer the door.. I answered the door and politely asked why you didn't call he didn't even apologize..   He seemed smug and un interested in what i had to say.. my total was 21.90 i had 25 to tip him 3$ but in the midst of all the mess I left it upstairs.. I handed him 23$ and he looked at me like I was stupid and said only 23 dollars..? Astounded I just shut the door.. I went back upstairs and settled in bed, the only reason I did order delivery is because I wasn't feeling well.. I open the bags and come to find out there was no fork or spoon not even a napkin in the bag.. Having to go back down stairs sick and on a bad knee to grab silverware I open my food and the chicken fried rice was descent, good flavor. The coconut chicken was like chicken in coconut soup, soggy and not done very well at all.. Due to this whole experience I will not be ordering from them at all ever again..",1

I placed a phone order for delivery (I usually do it online but I wanted a boba drink so I called it in instead because they dont have the drinks online). Let me replay the part of the conversation that made me angry...
Me:""Can I have a boba drink too?""
Person on the phone:""Yeah, you can have one. What do you want. "" (in a serious/annoyed voice)
Um. Wait. What?  That's not how you talk to a customer. I should've cancelled my order at that moment. But whatever, I guess my boyfriend and I will find other places close by. I actually liked this place but never again.",2

It is close to our home, so it is in the rotation of our go to places when we are feeling lazy or just don't feel like cooking. We only dined in once and the service was fine. The prices are pretty reasonable for the amount of food that you get. The menu is hit or miss, so if you find something that you like it is best to stick with it. I personally enjoy Happy Family (shrimp, chicken and beef), Szechwan Chicken and Chicken with Broccoli. These items come with steamed rice and are $5.75 for small and $8.95 for a large. I think a large entree is easily shareable if you get an appetizer or a soup to split as well. They do have a lunch special that ranges from $4.95 to $6.25 and includes an egg roll, rice, and a soup or hot tea if you're dining in. It is a good deal, but don't expect a ton of meat in your entree during the lunch special.",3

What I am saying is that for the cost, the overall quality is in line with my expectations. 

For the positives: taste, looks and quantity. The two guys that greet customers are awesome. 

For the negatives: The store is a mess and the bathrooms look like they are plague incubators. The older asian lady that is there sometimes is rude and makes me want to walk out before I even place an order.

When the egg drop soup is the best part of your dinner, it's kind of hard to recover. The soup was hot and fresh. What followed was average at best. The fried rice was dry and had a bland taste. The Mongolian Beef had plenty of flavor, but some of the meat was rather chewy and full of gristle. The iced tea was some of the worst I have ever tasted. It was brewed tea, but old. It had a sort of ""spinach"" taste to it. No amount of sweetener was going to help. The gal that took our order was very pleasant and friendly. The older gal that brought our food out was not.

Since moving to Vegas from the Bay Area I have had serious cravings for really good, authentic Chinese food. Specifically Egg Drop (Flower) Soup. I was impressed by the portions. I ordered a small ($2) and it was a huge serving - enough for two meals. The soup itself was full of flavor and so good, but it really lacked the extra corn and peas I'm used to having in it. I added on a side of steamed rice ($1) and some veggie egg rolls (2.50) to go along with it. The rice was somewhat stale... like it had been a day or two old, but again a massive serving. The egg rolls were slightly under-cooked but they were flavorful. 

The service is fair, the young man was nice but not overly friendly. After I got my food I found him sitting at a side station watching a movie or something on his cell phone. 

The cleanliness of the place is really lacking which is why I deducted stars, it is legit filthy in there. The soda machine is sticky and covered in dust, the tables are dirty, and the salt/pepper shakers look like they've NEVER been cleaned. 
Also, I dined in while waiting for my car and food was served on paper/styrofoam and plastic utensils. I thought maybe it was an accident until another customer dining in got the same thing...didn't really bother me (especially since I'm sure the to go plates are cleaner than a real plate would be there) but I think it's something to mention (not gourmet at all). 

All in all, if you can get past the cleanliness issues and just get your food delivered or to go, it's actually pretty decent. Although, I wouldn't recommend any seafood or meat items, the place is seriously dirty and I would question their practice of safe meat handling.",2

343958,FIX6bQgwYrVGCJu9sINClw,PAg_-9MtV7lX5rGb7yjLrQ,Used to be better. Beef chow fun had hardly any beef in it. Walnut shrimp over cooked. Chicken Tsao over cooked too much fatty chicken. Yuck!,2

I ordered teriyaki chicken, shrimp chow mien, orange chicken, egg rolls and white rice. First red flag was the broken soft drink fountain they had - the lemonade just produced the syrup, no actual lemonade. The orange chicken was obviously stale. The meat was like chewing plastic. The teriyaki chicken was disgusting, how hard is it to at least pour some teriyaki sauce over some grilled chicken, at the least. The sauce they use is a  gravy of some sort, I could honestly place it on top a bed of mashed potatoes. The white rice was hard and must have been a leftover batch from yesterday or hours before. The egg rolls were mediocre, a little greasy but whatever. The only thing that was decent was the shrimp chow mien, there were only 4 or 5 shrimp (large order) but at least the taste was there. This was my first and most definitely my last visit to ""NO NO NO""!",1

I have eaten food from Ho Ho Ho many times, for about 20 years now, since when they were at Sahara and Rainbow.  The food is usually pretty good.  Certainly a step above Panda Express, in my experience, and almost on par with PF Chang's, but for lower prices.  I recommend the spicier dishes.",3

The tofu dish that I ordered had crumbled up dried out and burned pieces of tofu. They were absolutely inedible. He could not even chew them or eat them.   The dish was soaked in a sauce that was so salty and burned my tongue. After this experience and then reading some of the yelp reviews I will never ever order from here again.,1

We had recognized the place from previously ordering delivery. We decided to order the family dinner A. Lemon chicken and general tso's chicken, hot and sour soup and chicken fried rice. The lemon chicken was breaded fried chicken with a yellow sauce on the side. It was dry, and far from lemon anything. The general tso's chicken was just ok, not real tasty, the hot and sour soup was not sour or hot it's greasy and slimy soup. Needless to say we are both still hungry and threw most of this meal in the trash. Should of went to Subway. We will not be returning and threw out all mailers for this sad excuse of a gourmet Chinese restaurant.",1

They are always so busy, it takes forever to get a table.
But what really upset me is the time I called in a to-go order on a Sun night around 7 pm. When I called in the order, they said it would take 25 min. 
So when I arrived at the restaurant 25 min later, (btw I waited by the to-go register for at least 5 min without even being acknowledge by any of the staff) I was told that the order just went in and it would take another 40 min. So I just cancelled my order and walked out.
If they would've just told me on the phone when I called in order that it would take an hour, I would've been ok with that. I could've waited at home for an hour doing something worthwhile instead of wasting my time waiting at the restaurant. But they lied and said it would only take 25 min.
It's too bad their service is horrible because I like their food.

So basically we had 2 Mongolian beef orders, lemonade, lo mein, calamari, rice, and our banana fried dessert all for 16.09$ u can't beat that and the service is good, Tara kept checking on us, even though we have to wait for awhile with our food it's totally worth it..

It is a shame they did not use nice sized shrimp.  If it were a $3.95 dish, I could see that, but for $15.00 grossly overpriced..

Sometimes I go inside but lately I have been using their curbside to go. You can call in your order or order online like I do. Compared to other places that offer curbside Chang's has it down. I'm never left waiting passed the promised pick up time and the person bringing out the food is courteous and goes over the whole order ensuring it's all there. 

The pork fried dumplings are super bomb. Great flavor and highly addicting. Chicken lettuce wraps from here are some of the best I've had. I change up between a few different beef dishes but it's always something spicy, beefy, tasty, and over white rice. The portions are good and vary like price depending if it's from the lunch or dinner menu.",5

I had some guests coming in from Denmark and thought it would be great to take them here.
Waited a long time 25 min to be seated on a week night and then when we were ....it took another 10 mins for the server to get there.
With a couple of other issues , I then went to the MANAGER on DUTY
JONELLE. 
I told her that I could have taken my guests anywhere and brought them to PF's. And I was embarrassed by the service, etc. and that it was substandard that evening. 
She got offended and started giving excuses instead of simply listening and saying she appreciated it and would handle it.
She made me out to be the Bad guy.

Today I spent a good but unnecessary dollar and your staff/mgmt/cooks were NOT WILLING to adjust the menu and it wasn't that busy - LAZY as far as I could see.

Love this place for happy hour, though this location can get very busy. We love the pork dumplings, salt and pepper prawns, spicy green beans, shaking beef. Really never had anything there that wasn't good. Love the fixins they bring to make a spicy sauce, but I love to make my own. Service here is always good.",4

345845,YZ4LexG_0Eo1s7Qrqq9s5g,k2zE7IsSi2lVpnrjqZXAdw,"Probably my favorite Chinese food.  Have eaten there dozens of times and tried almost everything.  I usually get the Chang's Chicken (highly recommended) and the Mongolian Beef.  Too bad they discontinued the Lemon Pepper Shrimp, which was awesome.  The down sides are that there is often a long wait to get seated, over an hour at peak dinner hour, and the price is higher than most Chinese food.  But other people have had poor experiences there.  They do have some dishes that are not that great, and if that was all I had ever ordered there, I would certainly give them a worse rating.  I do not recommend their salads, for example.  Service is usually very good, and they have a full bar for most any trendy cocktail you might want.",4
345846,jl5CsoSvfyb16F4YSEdsXQ,k2zE7IsSi2lVpnrjqZXAdw,"Eh. What a complete letdown. And honestly, waste of money.

First things first, the positives. The service was great. Our server was super nice and patient with us. The owner (I'm assuming) went around the restaurant, making sure everyone was happy and was served. The space itself was nice and spacious.

Aaand on to the not so good. Mainly the food. I wasn't expecting authentic Chinese food, but you know, at least decent food. This was not decent. The family and I got: calamari, Singaporean street noodles, Buddha's Feast, and the Chino-Latino Pineapple pork. The calamari was alright, bland and wasn't crispy. The sauce it came with didn't compliment the calamari at all. It almost overpowered it. The Singaporean noodles had potential, but it was wayy too salty. I ordered the Buddha's Feast, expecting it to be like a Buddha's delight sort of thing: veggies with brown sauce. What I got: steamed vegetables with some pieces of tofu. NO SAUCE. Like, wtf? I wouldn't have gotten that if I knew I was only getting steamed vegetables. I just doused it with some soy sauce because I needed some kind of flavor. The Chino-Latino pineapple pork wasn't bad at all actually. It the pork was a bit crisp, and the pineapple salsa ish topping was good. Also, my sister ordered this coconut refresher (can't remember the exact name) and it was just like coconut milk out of the can with a shitton of sugar. Not good.

With the quality of the food being not good, the price they charge is not worth it. At all. You're pretty much paying for the ~ambiance~. All four of us were disappointed by the end of the meal, and it was a consensus that we could get much better Chinese food at any Chinese restaurant in Chinatown. My brother even said that Panda Express food is better. And I agreed. It was that bad.

So overall, not good, not worth it, just go to Chinatown.",2
345847,IomJIMK4vCrotZOf8qt5BA,k2zE7IsSi2lVpnrjqZXAdw,"On a subsequent visit, Steamed Shrimp Dumplings were billowy and tasty.  Egg Rolls were dense and stuffed with vegetables.  Hot & Sour Soup was superb, and nice crispy noodles tasted even better dunked in a good but thin Sweet & Sour Sauce.  A rather unconventional style of Kung Pao Chicken was served, with very good browned chunks of chicken, peanuts, and Green Onions.  And, Diane greatly enjoyed her entree of Shrimp with Candied Walnuts. 

Everything washed down well with decaffeinated Sweet Ginger Peach Tea.  Service was again swift and efficient.  And, seating was comfortable amid an Asian ambiance.  

The food here is Americanized, yes!  But it is nevertheless quite tasty.",4
345848,oigp4CKJ9R9tOfpr2am4AQ,k2zE7IsSi2lVpnrjqZXAdw,"So it's been more then a year since the last time we ate here and we came back for two reasons. 1, to celebrate my niece's birthday and 2, the food here is great. But I swear every time we come the portions get smaller. Our dinner was great and everything went smooth, well for he most part. I informed the hostess that we were celebrating my niece's 12th birthday and they were nice enough to give her a cake with a candle and even nice enough to write it out on the plate, however, they gave her a new name, They ended up writing Happy Birthday Jessica, when my niece's name is Cheska. 

So at the end of our meal we had quite a few dishes that needed to be put in containers to take home. Now, out of all the times I've been here, I have always known for the servers to put the food in the containers themselves, as I was also watching other serves do the same at other tables. Our server Doug decided to just put the containers on the table for us to put it away, so I started doing so but he also ended up helping me too. we had 6 dishes plus 1 bowl of white and 1 bowl of brown rice but had only 6 containers so he had to go get more. Instead of bringing 2 he comes with one and asks if he can combine the white and brown rice together but naturally I said no so he had to go get more and come back with yet another container. Now, I was watching another server put away all the food for his customer in containers and I also watched him put away the lettuce from their lettuce wraps separate. He stored the lettuce in a plastic bag and the rest in the container but not our server, he just put everything in one box.

Now, normally I never have complaints with PF Chang as I do like this restaurant a lot but the fact that our server Doug wasn't all that great can really ruin the experience especially when you're their celebrating an occasion. I mean our server was friendly but he wasn't really 'waiting"" on us like a great server should where their always on top of their customers making sure drinks are filled and plates cleared.

Being newly vegan, my husband & I are limited on our options.  We were seated in about 1/2 the time we were told which was super and when I explained my food restrictions the waitress was very sweet and went back to grab a special list of food items.  Instead of her bringing out the list the manager Todd came out to us and went over options and even assured us they would cook our food in a fresh pan with new oil etc - which we thought was pretty great!  Our order of vegan choices were delicious...however, accidentally the waitress brought out shrimp dumplings instead of our vegetable dumplings and it wasn't discovered until I ate one and was halfway through the second one which might explain why it was extra delicious....(I AM SO SORRY SHRIMP FAMILY -- truly it was an accident)

The waitress felt so bad and apologized for the mistake - I am sure this will never happen again...she saw how choked up I was about it - as I was crying for the shrimp a little....but she was so empathetic and took full responsibility for the error and of course later a woman from the back (chef maybe?) came out to also apologize and made us a vegetable batch at no charge...At the end of the dinner, believe me the food for us was great, even for the two at our table that are carnivores they loved their chicken and enjoyed our vegan choices as well.  By the time we were done packing up our left overs - Todd came over again and had told us he had taken care of our dinner as well as gave us a card to come back again and try the vegan dishes all over again.  We couldn't have been more grateful for the AMAZING service from him as well as the wonderful people that he has on his team.  They may not be vegan now...but with that kind of care & compassion...it might be in their future one day.

This place has gone WAY down hill. The funny thing is my husband was on business in Philadelphia and ate at a PF Changs there and he agrees with me how bad it is lately. Went from one of our favorite restaurants to probably never again. My son ordered a chicken dish and I ordered the pad Thai. Both dishes the chicken was so tough you couldn't eat it. No flavor.,2

I ordered the ahi tuna roll, shrimp with lobster sauce and a side of brown rice, fried green beans, orange chicken with white rice, two teas, and a tossed salad. The best part of the meal was the salad. All of the items were tasteless. My server was amazing though and made sure to check in on my friend and I intermittently, our drinks were never empty.

I'm taking away 2 stars because the dining area was dark and crowded. 3 stars for the waiter and how quickly our food was brought out to us. Bill came up to about $65 with tip, not worth it IMO. I won't eat here again,",3

We got seated at our table and the drink host was fast and efficient.  Our waiter however was not.  We ordered the hot sour soup bowl.  When it came, one of the plastic spoons had a noodle of some kind dried up in it.  I pointed it out to our server and he took the spoon (which was in the bowl).  I asked if we could have another complete set.  No apology what so ever.  I had to ask twice for a refill of my soda.  My wife asked how long for a couple spring rolls.  He said 5 min.  15 min later he asks if we were ready for desert.  No egg rolls had arrived yet!  He went to get them.  We waited another 15 min for the check.  Keep in mind all our dishes were picked up.  Finally it came and again no apology for any part of the poor service.  I placed my cc'd down and waited..... And waited..... And then some more.  My wife and I gave up and came up with the cash between both of us.  I did have to go to the bar and ask for change.  That part was fast and efficient!  The bartender even picked up I was a little upset.  He asked if I wanted to speak to a mgr but I declined as we just wanted out.  Well a mgr did find us.  She apologized for everything and did a great job.  I just don't think we'll be going back to that location anytime soon.",2

Be careful of some of the dipping sauces if you can't tolerate hot foods. The one that tastes like horseradish will bring tears to you eyes! The kung pao chicken is tasty, and not too hot to eat.

The chow mein was too greasy, they used too much cooking oil in the dish. I eggrolls were nasty, not fresh, mushy, tasted like it's been thaw from freezer and put into the fryer.

They had a lot of open tables which probably isn't a great sign. 

Started with the pan-fried turnip cake which lost miserably to what my mommy makes. I had the pork belly which made the waiter pause uncertainly and warn me that ""it's very rich and fatty."" DUH, that's the POINT. It was good but I've had better for cheaper. Also, I thought there would be more of it. Sorry, I'm a fat kid. Or at least a greedy kid. My dining partner had the chilean sea bass which was really ... not that good; I think it was tad overcooked which is just bad form.

Met up with my acquaintance here since he works for the Wynn and everyone knows who he is around there. I arrived first and there was a table reserved for us. I'm very observant so I noticed all the workers are Asian and the food is very traditional Chinese. Most of the diners are Asian families. Getting the theme.

 I've had a rough night from partying, so I didn't have much of an appetite. Of course, I did order the Hot and Sour soup. We shared an order of the kung pow chicken with brown rice and edamame. he asked me how the soup was, and being the honest person, I had to say it was a bit too salty for me. He laughed and said, I like that you're honest and not trying to please people. (at least you all can trust on my reviews :))

Overall, great service and food is pretty good. packed with flavor. Note: They even have Shao long bao. Great place to impress the family or future in-laws.  It is pricey, so don't be surprised. You're at the Wynn! :)",4

The service was excellent. My drink was rarely low and our food came out in probably less than 10 minutes. It was super fast.

I went with the Kung Pao Chicken. It was delicious. It was the typical Kung Pao Chicken you can get at places such as PF Changs, so I was glad they didn't try to make it real unique and change it up.

Overall, it was good food and a good experience.",4

The meal was comped but seriously this place was horrible. Panda express would be an improvement over this place. The bill was 130 for one person for lunch. Of course i had leftovers to take to pops but I felt like he might feel as though I was trying to poison him. I ordered the cantonese pot stickers to start. You could do better in the frozen section at costco. Next up I opted for the upgraded beef dish which is served table side on a sizzling platter it was like pepper beef sirloin or something like that. Really boring dish no imagination. was funny when i was ordering the waiter suggests i upgrade even further to kobe beef,I said well you probably wont get the benefit if its covered in a sauce,he says I will,even though i had a 200 comp and would not have had to pay for it I didn't do it. I asked him how much would it cost ,he says let me look on the menu,after we look together he cant find it he estimates it to cost around 90 dollars,like i said it would have been comped but it seemed too egregious to me. Next I ordered the sweet and sour chicken,total crap again you could do much better at panda express or costco. And lastly I ordered a bbq pork and shrimp combo fried rice,this was the best dish of all and I suspect that it is served regularly at the CCDC on fried crap night. In conclusion im glad i had  the comp but i still had to tip for 20 bucks ,its not the servers fault so i always take care of them. The server was very nice actually. Steve must be losing his taste as well as his vision because anyone who would rate this anything but touristy garbage food is on the payroll.",1

I thought it was interesting as they offer menu items from China, Thailand, India, Vietnam, Singapore, and Korea such as Cantonese noodle dishes, dim sum, duck, Mongolian Beef, and Hong Kong style barbecue.  We started off with the Malasyain Chicken Satay that came with a side of chunky peanut sauce - the chicken was okay, and the the chunky peanut sauce was more on the sweeter side.  I had the Penang-Style Rice Flat Noodles with Chicken and I wasn't a fan of the dish as it lacked flavor.  I did like the flat noodles, though, but they were overcooked.  One of my friends had the Curried Singapore Rice Vermicelli that contained shredded pork, shrimp, egg, and bean sprouts - she enjoyed it, but I wasn't a fan of the different spices that were used.

The large tables at the bench seating area as well as the large central tables require that people practically shout to reach each other. I did not appreciate being in the midst of such a noisy place. 
Staff were wonderful. Michael the waiter was superb!
I had the eggplant and pork (although they serve pork belly and have to explain that to you, it is not on the menu which I think is wrong) with cat's eye noodles. It was delicious. I would have preferred to have pork as stated on the menu though.
My husband enjoyed the Kung Pao shrimp very much.  He is a tough critic and stated it was one of the best meals ever.
We shared the chicken satays which were among the best I have had and the peanut sauce was texturally superb and seasoned perfectly.
I am not ever a fan of bench seating but although you are not totally on top of people next to you on the bench, you are so far away from your dining partner that it is very weird and not pleasing at all.  We were seated near a bunch of twenty somethings under the influence of alcohol whose voices even sober were obnoxious...

We didn't make reservations but were able to get a table right away. We ordered two appetizers (Ginger String Beans and Jade Dumplings), and entrees consisted of Dan Dan Noodles and Cashew Chik'n. There was a good amount of food and every bit we had was ~*delicious*~. Our server was quick and polite and was able to answer any questions we had.

I ordered rice separately to go with the dish and they charged $3.00 for a tiny bowl of rice. Why not include it? It is a tiny bowl of rice and I am sure it is not going to break the bank for it to be free. That made a pleasant meal less so... they extra fee on the check.",4

The flavor was perfect.  The choy sum stir fried with garlic was delicious, even my daughter enjoyed it.  I also ordered the prawns with eggs, knowing that I can't go wrong since my kid loves eggs. The prawns are giant looking...

When she first set the oxtail soup in front of me, I was a little worried. Never having tried it, I did not know what to expect and the visible bone surprised me. Reservations aside, I tried the broth and it was excellent. From the broth on moved on to the carrot, carefully avoiding the bone. The vegetables were also delicious so I decided to go a hard and try the meat. It was excellent. Very tender and had a great flavor. I would absolutely order again. 

The Jade Dumplings also looked a little bizarre as they are bright green. They were also delicious. Very moist and tasty filling. 

The shrimp on the Shrimp Pad Thai were huge and full of flavor. The rest of the dish was pretty standard fare. I had asked for my Pad Thai to be extra spicy but I felt like it lacked heat. All in all, I love Pad Thai and this dish satisfied.

The Hot and Sour soup was pretty good, tasted like all the other chain Chinese restaurants here in Canada.

The Beef fried rice was also pretty good, well seasoned, nice beef taste

The BBQ Pork and Duck I was very disappointed with.
The first bite I took was greeted with a million sharp shards of bones. Both the Pork and Duck were really dry, and of course served with some even drier rice.  Another problem is the rice to meat ratio. You can tell this restaurant does not care about details or quality when they just shoved about 3 bowls of rice onto a plate topped with a couple pieces of meat. I'm not complaining about the meat, I would have rather they  not give me a bunch of rice which I am not going to eat. I am Asian and when you eat meat with your rice you usually take a bite of the meat, and a spoonful of rice. Well that's what I did (the meat and rice were very dry I had to drink a cup of water after each bite) and I did not even finish half the rice, not even a quarter.

Food came, you asked for a bowl and took another century to come and had to physically tackle the server on the other table. You wait some more and the bowl was probably still in the factory. Worst part, Nobody even apologized.

Service is mediocre on their best day though their food is pretty decent.  (Let me rephrase that... they would not make it as a Chinese restaurant in LA or SF China Town, but it's a good Chinese noodle house given the slim picking in Vegas).  

I have put up with their abuse and mediocre service over the years.  My complaints to Venetian customer service had largely gone unanswered.  Still, given the convenience of its location, I have tolerated such bad service, until tonight.

In any case, the latest episode took place tonight.  It's 9:30 on Saturday night.  I thought I would try to get a bite by myself.  When I got there, I noticed 2 empty seats at the bar so I walked up and try to sit down.  The hostess promptly kicked me out and told me to stand in the back of the line.  Amazingly, like a well-trained starved puppy, I obediently went to the back of the line and waited for my turn.  As I finally made it to the front of the line, as luck would have it, all the seats the bar are now taken.  I offered to wait on the side as there is now a long line BEHIND me, but of course, the waitress told me I have to go back to the END OF THE LINE, again!  What?  I just went from the back to the front of the line and now I have to stand in the back AGAIN, a SECOND time?  

I thanked her and left without eating.

When are these people going to learn that at the end of the day, it's still about customer service.  I suppose given that Venetian allows them to still be around, in spite of such consistent and persistent subpar service, someone must be happy with them.  I guess as long as they are paying rents, that's all Venetian cares about.  Either that, or perhaps acceptable customer service does not matter to sleep-deprived gamblers.  

Bottom line, if you are willing to be abused and mistreated for a bowl of good noodles, this is the place for you.  If being treated like a human being matters to you, DO NOT COME HERE.",1

We got seated fairly quickly and was given water and menus. I tried to find something that would help my ""hungover-fml-dont-wanna-move"" stupor and finally settled on the Szechuan beef noodle soup. The wait for our food was pretty fast and thank the lord for that bc i was starving and at 9pm, it was my first meal of the day ):

The soup itself has a slight kick to it which made it even yummier. The chunks of beef were soft and delicious as well and the noodles were chewy and filling! After inhaling that bowl of soup, it lifted that raging hangover and the ""holy shit i wanna die"" mentality. THANK YOU FOREVER omg. 
My friend got the shrimp fried rice but it was kinda bland but the plate was HUGE

We had the dan dan noodles - peanut sauce and minced pork. The sauce was great but the noodles was a tad bit overcooked. Nonetheless, a decently priced meal for the location. 

Efficient service, considering the restaurant was packed. I think they cannot afford not to be as volume is key to their survival. If you don't want fast-food and want to spare your pockets a pinch... this would be a perfect choice for a fussy-free meal.",3

Still,  it's hard to give them a better rating when a simple standard dish such as Mapo tofu and Hot and sour soup was horrid.  Soup was overly sour and the Mapo tofu had no taste.   It just tasted like tofu with cornstarch cooked into it.  No flavor.  None.  Maybe some salt?   The crispy noodles and Mongolian beef was decent.   I added an extra star because these two dishes were borderline food court level.   The shu mai dimsum appetizer was also decent but nothing special.  $9 for 6 pieces.    Every dish was around $15+ but that's because it's inside a hotel.   All the cooks and servers were Asian.  Service was Asian like.   That means it was below average.

telling me about a certain dish which I shared a nommy sentiment.
The restaurant is Chinese-themed, and it is called Noodle Asia,
a few steps away from the casino floor is where you will find it.

The wait in line was somewhat time-consuming,
so be sure to account for the wait when you are starving.
This restaurant can accommodate parties large and small,
if you are forever alone have a seat at the bar by the kitchen wall.

Their menu has many appetizing offerings,
drinks, foods, and other delicious things.
On the both occasions that I visited with my group,
I got a pot of hot tea, and a bowl of the Sichuan beef noodle soup.

The service here was efficient, accurate, and brisk,
our food order came out in about 10 minutes - nothing was amiss.
The tea was what you'd expect from any ol' Asian joint,
but oh my stars I must emphasize that the noodle soup was ON POINT.

The beef noodle soup had me speechless,
the taste of the broth had the right mix of savory spices,
the meat was exceedingly fatty, with a buttery texture,
and the noodles brought the balance to bring the entire dish together.

All-in-all I'd say Noodle Asia is a must-try spot,
primarily for the Sichuan beef noodle soup fresh from the pot.
Make sure you give this place a whirl,
as you wander about the City of Sin, looking for them hot girls.

I wasn't sure what to expect but was pleasantly surprised with their food.

Schezuan Beef Noodle Soup- Very good! I like it just as much as the places in Rowland or SGV! Chewy noodles with a dark beefy soy/vinegary broth and lots of tender beef chunks. The only thing is i wish it had some MORE greens in it than the skimpy green onions. Perhaps some cilantro/onion and the chopped pickled mustard greens or bokchoy like the other places. Overall delicious but the soup gets hella salty towards the end be warned.

Spicy Ying Nan Noodle Soup- NOT spicy at all. Tastes pretty bland. Its not seafood broth or chicken or beef broth. Can't really distinguish what the base taste is. Even with 2 generous scoops of Chili sauce it wasn't really spicy. I would skip this next time, however other people liked it.

Hot and Sour Soup- Loved it! I was wary since some reviews say it is not good but we liked it alot! Good balance of sour in my opinion and lots of toppings

Pho Special- $18 for a bowl of Pho better be good and it was according to my fellow Vietnamese diners! So if you can't make it to Pho Kim Long, here is a back up! (Another Pho back-up would be ordering the ""Zen Noodles"" at Grand Lux Cafe)

On the other hand, this place is right smack in the middle of the Venetian (shoutout Palazzo and Venetian for having the sickest rooms though), so the convenience is definitely a plus. There be many a days where I'm hungover and gotta wait like 20 min for valet to get my car, where I probably coulda just stayed here cause everything would have tasted the same to me anyway.

This place is pretty Americanized and you'll see it right away when you look at the venue (hell, even the name just gives it away, like who would put ""Asia"" on somewhere that serves authentic Chinese food?). I ordered the Hong Kong Won Ton, which was just your typical won ton noodle soup, but it wasn't bad and it definitely helped my killer hangover.

Also, the prices are pretty ridiculous (standard for casino food). You'll be paying $15 for the same exact shit you can get at Sam Woo's for like $6. If you're trying to save money while getting legit ass noodles, then I definitely suggest you look up Noodle Pot or any of the places near Chinatown (just turn left on Sands and head down Spring Mountain Rd for like 5-10 minutes).

Shanghai rice cakes - yum! The cabbage and pork is cooked perfectly and the soy sauce based sauce is delicious. I love these thicker ""noodles"" as they're a nice change from the usual mein or fun.

We were ignored and eventually had to chase someone down to pay, then again to correct overcharging for items. It was an extremely bizarre experience all the way around. 

Vegetarian options are very limited and my shrimp dish had only 4 shrimp for a TON of noodles. Several people enjoyed their meals at our table, but more people did not. (Supposedly the chicken fried rice is about as bland as you can get.)

All told it's remarkable that you can get a totally legit bowl of noodles (for your first visit, have the Szechuan Beef Noodle, it's perfectly delicious) up until 3am, right at the Venetian. I suspect it's not the best-tasting or the most reasonably-priced bowl of noodles you'll ever have in your life, but compared to other post-nightclub eats (bacon-wrapped hot dogs in LA? super-greasy ""hidden pizza"" at The Cosmopolitan?) at post-midnight hours, this place really is a stand-out, and a rather well-staffed treat.

Agree with the others below that this place is probably the only legit Chinese food spot on the strip. The lines can be long but they move fast. The staff and cooks are also Asian so they move fast but don't expect a bunch of wasted chit chat. Just order your noodles and chow down. 

The infamous szechaun beef noodle soup is really on point. Deep, rich and with a slight heat, the beef has got tendon and all. Soft. The noodles are tender, perhaps slightly overdone. But the flavors are thoroughly satisfying. The char sui (BBQ pork) is a bit fatty and they swipe on a different sauce than usual. The dan dan noodles are more peanut and less spicy than most. Just add hit sauce.

After a long 3 1/2 hour drive from California, checking into the Bellagio, and getting settled in the room, they start craving for Asian food. The first restaurant that comes up in Noodles because it's not too big like the other restaurants and it's tucked away right by the Baccarat Bar and table games. 

Every time we wait to be seated, it takes about 15 - 20 minutes but when Chinese customers wait, they are seated right away like they were, V.I.P.'s. Sounds like discrimination to me!  The Contemporary decoration in this restaurant was very relaxing with various jar of ingredients they use for their overpriced food. 

Our server was friendly and personable and gave us our drinks right away with some time to order. 

We ordered: 

*Hot Tea $4.50 -- Jasmine

*CHILEAN SEA BASS $34: Nonya curry sauce, bell peppers, onions (steamed) Homemade garlic ginger sauce, broccoli (steamed or deep fried) Soy sauce, green onions, ginger (steamed)

*BEEF $22 Kung pao sauce, bell peppers, onions, peanuts Broccoli, straw mushrooms, carrots Mongolian style, bell peppers, onions, green onions
Black pepper sauce, asparagus Black bean sauce, bell peppers, onions, garlic

*CHINESE BROCCOLI $12.50 Sautéed in garlic or steamed (oyster sauce)

*CANTONESE ROAST DUCK $18.50 Plum sauce

The food in my honest opinion was delicious and I couldn't fault on anything. What bothered me and caused the review to go from 5 stars to 2 stars was the service. It took us a while to get our refills for out water and the food took about 25  - 35 minutes to be served. 

Our server kept telling us, ""the food was on it's way,"" my Dad got tired of waiting and went to hit the slots. Around the restaurant, I noticed a lot of Chinese customers were getting their food much faster than us and that made me irritated. I never experienced this level of service.

Noodles is a little difficult to locate on the Bellagio Casino floor -- but well worth the effort. We arrived before 6 PM and already the line was spilling into the casino. Although noodles are the featured item, entrees of chicken, pork and beef are included on the menu. Wingz are a standout appetizer -- cutsey name aside, bone-in wings are encased in a really cripsy, spicy crust. Shrimp temupura were large and the flavor was exactly what you'd expect.

I opted for the Udon noodle soup since it's something you don't see too much since Ramen seems to be the more popular soup in Japan.  Soup was good, not great and I enjoyed it.  Because of other Asian noodle shops in Vegas, I probably have my list that I must go to every time I'm in Vegas.  This is not one of those.

You know that restaurant that stays open all night, after the real restaurants have closed, to feed the late night crowd.  It usually has a little of everything, but nothing that stands out.  Food for sustenance, not for pleasure. 

Noodles is the Asian version of that cafe, only it closes at 3am.  A variety of random Asian dishes, some better than others, but nothing that stands out or that you'd want to go back for.  

I had the double happiness with BBQ pork and roast duck.  It's a dish with all meat, so I ordered a small bowl of rice on the side.  If you get the fried rice with duck, it's 90% rice, 10% duck.  The dish was $22.50 and while overpriced, still the best plate on the table.  Both meats were tender and flavorful.  You could easily order this dish and share among 2 people.  Well worth it.  

My hb got the laksa curry noodle.  It was a decent sized bowl, was steaming hot, but a bit on the fishy side for me.  More fishy, less curry.  Not my favorite.  

Our friend got the braised beef brisket rice.  He said it was good, but not great.  It was more of a meal for one as opposed to a dish to share, so plan accordingly.  

We also tried the tempura shrimp and at $12.75 came with 4 pieces.  They were decent sized, and done well, but easily something you could get anywhere else.  

Service was just ok.  It seemed there were many servers, but a lot of waiting around.  We weren't in a hurry, so we weren't bothered by it, but I did see a server straight up eating behind the counter, then with food still in her mouth and chewing, she picked up a few dishes and served them.

My group was comprised of three couples. Couple one ordered some white chicken and broccoli noodle dish that they really liked. Boyfriend and I/the 2nd couple got potstickers, miso, and pad Thai off the Pre-Fixe menu. All tasty! I loved the miso flavor--the saltiness was perfect. The postickers were okay, I'm not sure if they were sausage or what but the meat was kinda pink. Pad Thai was great--they used wide noodles in this dish, so that was a change but one I liked.

The table was kind of cool looking at first--it had a low tube backing. Downside to it was that all three of us on one side slammed our knees into the table leg getting out! I've got a big ol' bruise from that now.",4
459447,MVm28wmd727nc6Moe7sspQ,E9ZsPtGovfEPHlMHkDdlQA,"Went here looking for Dim Sum after being sorely disappointed by a previous off-the-strip choice in a stand alone building ( I won't say any names here). This was a pleasant surprise as the food that I had was good to average. 

For Dim Sum, I had the baked and steamed pork buns, crystal steamed shrimp dumplings, and the crab and spinach dumplings. They were all ""good"". My main entree was the steamed Chilean Sea Bass served with steamed rice. Unfortunately, at $35 it was only ""average"". By no means bad, but I've had better at Mitchell's Fish Market Restaurant chain. Overall, all of the dishes needed more seasoning because they tasted somewhat bland for my palate. I also had two tall glasses of their Thai iced tea. I'd highly recommend it. 

Service was very fast, professional, and tip worthy. There were a lot of Asians eating there which to me is a very good sign. There was a line snaking outside from the hostess desk out to the casino proper. So, plan ahead, especially if you have a group of four or more.",3
459448,BfDzkH5ItQZ_4rB339eWWw,E9ZsPtGovfEPHlMHkDdlQA,"My review won't be based on the service rather the food. The price point for the food is a bit high as well, but what do you expect to pay in Vegas? 

I recently stayed at the Bellagio and came here everyday. The first two nights, I ordered the Mandarin beef noodle soup. This is a beef stew noodle soup and I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's also good hangover food. They give plenty of beef (they better for the price) and the broth (stew) was refreshing. 

Before leaving I had the dim sum and was not impressed. They didn't have my favorite dim sum dish and the items were limited. I would not come here to get the dim sum. We left with a large bill and feeling hungry. 

If I just went for the beef stew noodle soup, I would give Noodles four stars. Try the soup, if you're at the Bellagio. It's $20, but worth a try if you want Asian food.",3
459449,ApF0-dNObwDaWYPW1TYFzA,E9ZsPtGovfEPHlMHkDdlQA,"Their noodle dishes are nothing amazing, but if you've been eating buffets and American food all weekend in Vegas, and you need a quick Asian noodle fix, this is it (I know some of you Asians know what ""fix"" I'm talking about.) And this place is better than that other place at the Wynn, Red 8. 

Personally, I'm Korean so I don't have craving for noodle soup like my Chinese husband. Rather, I have cravings for rice and kimchee.

Their KIMCHEE IS LEGIT.  Amazing. So good.

The food is admittedly overpriced, especially for a style of cuisine that costs very little to make, but I don't necessarily fault the restaurant for that. You should always expect higher prices when dining on the strip. The bigger problem is that the line to be seated can get pretty long, and they don't take reservations. Sometimes you do get lucky, though. When I went yesterday, I only waited for about 5 minutes.

I would say that this restaurant is comparable to Beijing Noodle No. 9 at Caesar's. Of the two, Beijing seems to have better food, but I would say that Noodles has the more relaxing atmosphere. 

Either restaurant would be a fine choice, but overall, I think I like Beijing Noodle No. 9 a little bit better.",3

My hubby's favorite is the Mandarin Beef Noodle. The flavors are on point and is super delicious. Their Wing Zing chicken wings are so yummy. Their congee is great too. I wouldn't recommend their fried calamari though, it's a sorry miss.

Beef broccoli was out of this world...the depth of beef flavor in the sauce with sweetness and these was either cognac or aomething that made it stand out in your mouth..not like any other in Hawaii, California, Vegas or in Chinatown in Japan or Korea.....lol haven""t been to China....will always make this a stop in vegas",5

Lets just say that I know of many places out of state where this would have been fine for 8 bucks but for 20+? The whole casino experience is really starting to be a huge turnoff. They serve swill and you get raped at the tables,awesome! Thank you sir may i have another? The best part of the whole meal was the giant beer i ordered,luckily they cant influence the taste of a sealed item.

It's a bit hidden in the casino so you may want to ask for directions. The casual eatery has a large selection of dishes to choose from. I recommend picking something with noodles, hence the name. I had gotten the wonton noodles before, and it was pretty good after adding some salt. I also recommend the Thai iced tea. 

Unfortunately, today I ordered the Hainanese chicken with bones in, and this was the worst I have had. The chicken tasted a bit funky and was very salty. The soup that came with the dish was salty too, but it tasted ok after eating the chicken. That's how salty the chicken was. It overpowered everything. The side sauces were nothing special just minced ginger, chili, and soy sauce. I had to ask for a sweet chili sauce to make the chicken more bearable. The fragrant rice that came with the chicken was the only good part of the dish. It costs around $22 too! 

Overall, come here for the wide variety of Asian food and stick with noodles. The menu has traditional Mandarin too for those who like a Mandarin menu. This is also a good choice if you're dining alone since there's a row of individual seating on a low bar style area.",3

It was like $20 for a bowl of pho.  Where I'm from it's like $5-$10 max wherever I've been.  Pretty ridiculous pricing here if you ask me.  And the pho wasn't even great; it tasted plain.  My friend got the cucumber salad.  When the waitress brought it out it looked like a side order or extra stuff like cilantro that you'd put on your food.  Plate was hella small in portion.  And it cost $8.  So glad I didn't opt for salad this time.  I would've been super disappointed and pissed.  I ordered the fried rice which cost $15-16 bucks.  I was so happy with this order compared to the rest.  It tasted decent and It was bigger in portion LOL  I did have to add a lot of hot sauce to it and peppers.

When my one friend wanted a beer, she asked the waitress.  The waitress told her she had to order that at the bar!  Lolololol of course I should've expected this.  Asian customer service has mostly always been terrible.  Luckily, the waitress changed her mind and got it for her.

I thought the food was a little bland but I remember that's what older chinese people like. So you may have to add some salt and pepper but I thought it was better since it's healthier. 
I was extremely hungry on the casino floor and there wasn't much open, but I remembered my friend telling me that Noodles was pretty good. I came a few hours ago but the wait was 45 minutes. Around 12am, I probably only waited around 20 minutes.
Once we sat down, the server came relatively quickly to take our order and our food came soon after. We ordered the kimchi, hot and spicy cucumber, roast duck and roast pork, bokchoy in garlic sauce, and 2 congee with century egg and pork. Everything was very good but like I said earlier, a little bland. Although the pork in the congee was very flavorful. Definitely satisfied my craving for Chinese food! 

My only complaint would be that it's pretty pricey but then again it's casino food, it's expected. My will probably be going back here since my friends will be back for poker.

Basically $20 per order. The portions are small compared to your typical chinese restaurants. We were there with six in our party and we order five dishes. Two noodle dishes, one fried rice, one meat and one tofu dish. Thinking that this should be plenty of six people as one order is most chinese restaurants if far more food than can be eaten by one person,  but we polished off everything and could have eaten a sixth dish but we had a show to catch so we decide not to add anything. We ate around 6 pm and no line to be seated but when we left there was a line of around 20 people. The restaurant is small  and decor is interesting with the bottles of dried food items on one wall and the other wall had these rope wall hangings that seem out of place for a chinese restaurant .  Nevertheless it is probably the lowest priced place for dinner in Bellagio where you can get dinner for $20/person. Basically it was okay but have to rate it down due to the price and portion size.

My boyfriend and I ordered 3 things shumai, fried rice and a udon seafood soup. The pork and shrimp shumai comes with 5 pieces I would highly recommend very good. We also got the regular fried rice with chicken, it was good but not the best I've tasted. The reason I'm giving them 4 stars Is because I found a piece of hair in my fried rice which was really gross. People in the kitchen just needa be a little more careful. Being the type of person I am I didn't want to make a big deal out of it. I let my waitress know she was very nice about it apologized and said she would let the manager know. The manager then came over to us and apologized as well asked us if we wanted another new fried rice made me and my boyfriend declined the offer as we were waiting for another dish she gladly said she was going to take off the fried rice for us. We also got a seafood noodle soup it had huge pieces of shrimp squid and seabass (which was delicious) the broth was a little plain but it's ok just added some shoyu in there and you are set.

It's a very casual place that caters to convenience of being right there and serves trendy and upscale Americanized Asian bistro. Of course, like most of these hotel restaurants, it prices itself way high and makes you think you're getting a better experience than you really are getting. The service is decent, not great, but decent. 

On my two visits, I ordered the Pad Thai noodles with pot sticker dim sum and Hor Fun with Satay Chicken. Being a Thai food aficionado, there was something a bit odd about the Pad Thai, almost a sickly sweet taste to it. The pot stickers were not exceptionally noteworthy. The Hor Fun was the best dish I ordered. The Satay Chicken was good, but it's pretty hard to screw that dish up.

I applaud them for giving correct portion sizes. They do not dump a truckload of food on a plate. It's a respectable serving size without making you feel like a glutton for finishing your bowl. The service was a bit sketchy. Not awful, but not great. My waitress just had the attitude of ""what do you want to eat,"" not ""can I answer any questions you might have?""

After swinging our arms and giving her the head nod. The hostess finally went to get her. (-1 star) When she got to us, she was friendly and even spoke Chinese, which I guess is a plus if you can't speak English. 

To the food: we ordered the premium fried rice, some kind of soba noodle soup, beef noodle soup, duck egg congee, crab meat vermicelli noodles, a few dim sum items. 

Hold on to your hats, I'm going to do a quick run through of everything. 

Premium fried rice: contains pineapples. Has a sweet taste. However very dry, so I'm assuming they used fresh cooked rice, making the fried rice dry. Tasted like nothing to me. L

Soba noodle soup: tastes like sake.

Beef noodle soup: good soup base, but there was not enough soup. The beef was well cooked, so it was soft and it easily ""melted"" in your mouth. The egg noodles did not match the taste of the beef noodle soup. The noodles tasted like flour to me.

Congee: tasted pretty good, the chicken had no taste.

Vermicilli noodles: crab meat was dry. Dish was okay but really salty for my taste. 

Dim sum: it was dim sum but it wasn't with like 9-11$ for a plate. Haha.

Overall, if you're craving Asian and are too lazy to walk into the hell wrath heat outside, go here. Otherwise I don't recommend. :)",3

We got the calamari and pad thai. Calamari tasted like it was defrosted, left out, then slightly heated up. Rubbery and greasy texture. I thought it was funny how badly i got ripped off. I kept telling my girlfriend in a sarcastic chinese manager voice ""haha you stupid idiot pay $40 dollar for sh*@&$ food"". Good thing im rich and don't care about costly mistakes like this.

459497,B1cThUYVVkDtD-H93rfq-A,E9ZsPtGovfEPHlMHkDdlQA,"I wandered the Strip with some girlfriends during Memorial Day weekend and stumbled upon Noodles in the Bellagio. 

First, the hostesses took a while to seat us despite the fact that there were several empty tables in the restaurant. Once we were seated, and we ordered our food, it took a really long time for it to come out. I'm a pretty patient person, and I would not say gluttony is a deadly sin of mine, but JEYZUS the food took SO LONG to come out. If the restaurant was busier I would understand, but wow it took literally more than half an hour after we ordered, and we only had five people in our party. Food was alright...kind of mediocre, I wouldn't come here again (& for more reasons below!). The five of us each got different dishes and they were okay...pretty subpar. I guess being Asian, you have a bit of a higher standard for noodle dishes, but as non-biased as I am trying to be, the food here was below average.

The worst part came AFTER we left Noodles. One of my friends had an allergic reaction to the food (she ordered the pad thai) after we left. She had trouble breathing and broke out in hives everywhere until she took some Benadryl to alleviate the reaction. She is allergic to nuts, not peanuts (peanuts are legumes, not nuts!), so we assumed there may have been other nuts in the pad thai they might have not listed on the menu. We called the restaurant to let them know of this and after talking to several (at least 3) people at the restaurant, they repeatedly just read the menu to us and said she might've had a reaction to the peanuts. Like I said...she is not allergic to peanuts and orders pad thai all the time. There were probably other products in the food that were processed in a place with nuts, we assumed. We talked to the manager and he was very apologetic over the phone, got our information down (what hotel we were staying at, what room, how bad the reaction was, etc.), and insisted that he send someone up to our hotel room to check on my friend. She was feeling a little better (able to breathe, thank God), but we agreed to the person coming up to check on her just to make sure she was okay. We waited quite a while in the hotel room...no one came up. The manager ended the phone call with ""Sorry about that, hope you feel better."" ...thanks, NOODLES.

Overall experience: mediocre food and bad customer service (even before my friend got sick). And then they did not keep their promise of having someone come up to our hotel room at the Monte Carlo. Yes, my friend did feel better after taking Benadryl, but after getting our information down and extensive phone conversations with us regarding the situation, and all of us waiting in our room, you would think management would come through. We also e-mailed them after we left Vegas a couple days later about this, but no response. -_-

Get it together, NOODLES!",1
459498,YHiLTKVOZ9fHO-U4FQeBJw,E9ZsPtGovfEPHlMHkDdlQA,"Read Steph V's post below for more details.

The wait was unnecessary considering how many empty tables were there. The food took so long to come out. I'd say about 30 minutes honestly, and that's not an exaggeration. I give Noodles one star for the okay food that satisfied our hunger. It's not the best asian food around Vegas, and it's also not the cheapest. 

The biggest disappointment with Noodles came after the food. Our friend got a severe allergic reaction to something she ate and upon calling Noodles, we received one of the worst customer service. They said they would send someone to check up on our friend, but no one ever came. It was a huge liability issue on their part, and we could've taken more action if we really wanted to.

Also, done the beef stew noodles - was missing something. The dim sum is okay. However, there is one dish that wins. The XO crab lump noodles. The dish is just perfect. It has the right balance of crab, XO sauce, XO beef strips. Great after late nights drinking or gambling.

Order the snow pea leaves with garlic...awesome. A great place for a lighter meal with very attentive and friendly service. If you eat at PF Changs and that is your idea of good Chinese, then this place will be lost on you and you will probably think it's expensive...it's well done Chinese food by chefs who know how to cook.

The Roast Duck is meaty and succulent and you don't have to waste your time chewing around a bone.  It is so flavorful and juicy, I drool actually writing and thinking about it now.

The Bean Curd wrapped around Shrimp is a nice Dim Sum to get your started.

We were seated pretty quick,but were stuck in the back, by the kitchen door. The staff weren't friendly, but they weren't rude... Just didn't seem to care if you were there or not. My husband and I eat Thai food regularly, so we had some experience beneath us before deciding what to eat. I didn't want anything too heavy, since it was so late, so I opted for the fried rice and my husband had duck with a side of steamed rice. My fried rice was tasteless and dry. My husband's duck didn't have much flavor and full of fat.

So when we're at the Bellagio, Noodles is our go to restaurant.  (I guess we're often hungry and drunk when we're there.}  Yes, it's pricey, but it's still cheaper than any of the other restaurants in the hotel unless you're having a burger or a pastry.

Many people seem to know this because the line can stretch pretty far out the door. We try to eat earlier rather than later because it seems like the line doesn't diminish after a certain hour.  Turnover is fairly quick, though.

Okay, so you order a bowl of won ton and noodle soup because the rum and cokes you're drinking have been eating away your stomach lining.

But you're paying a lot of money for a small bowl of noodles. The ambiance, like the rest of Vegas, covers up structural problems with a dazzling and dizzying array of exotic looking noodles in jars against the wall, almost as if a noodle crazed mad scientist had taken up residence in the restaurant. But the food was on the meager side, and expensive, evn given the quality. And we found the service to be wanting. I think they were short a waiter, but we had to call one over after waiting an unusual amount of time for someone to take a drink order. The food also took a long time, even though we arrived well after the typical dinner hour. Also, I wouldn't come here if a member of your party is a frequent visitor to bathrooms and has trouble walking. The bathrooms are on the other side of the casinos (of course), so you'll be trekking through slot machines and hordes of well dressed career professionals to get to the facilities. Unfortunately, while Vegas may have good food here and there, often there isn't a lot of choice once you're anchored in a casino. Each one has their pride and joy restaurants. For what it's worth, I'd either skip the noodle section of the menu here and hope for something better in, say, the Mappo dofu, or try the Cantonese restraurant across the way which may or may not be a better choice.",2

The cost of the food was pretty pricey. My husband and I shared a prefixed menu that included soup, noodles, and dumplings. The prefixed menu cost $28 and you cannot do substitutions. For the soup, there was a choice of wonton soup or miso soup. The noodles choices included pad Thai, chow mein, and 2 other choices. The dumplings could be steamed or fried.  

We got the wonton soup which was really delicious. It came with 4 shrimp wontons. For the noodles, we got the pad Thai with pork BBQ. You have the option of having it with shrimp, chicken or beef too. The pad Thai was a bit salty for me. The fried dumplings were good too. My sister ordered the chow mein and she said the noodles tasted really fresh.  The prefixed meal was plenty for me and my husband. We even had leftovers to box up.

First the service ....Some of the best of the week so far.  There was a line (always a good sign!) We stood in it for about 15 minutes but the hostess kept us up to date on how long about every three minutes. Really pro. We were seated in the comfortable surroundings of a top grade Asian noodle house. Once in our seats I could smell the aroma of wonderful broth and hear the familiar slurp sound that is a must in a noodle venue. We ordered appetizers. Easy choice was the chicken satay with an amazing peanut dipping sauce. Also sampled the shrimp tempura. So perfectly fried and tender beyond imagination. But the barometer of a noodle house is of course noodles in broth. I added the BBQ pork with egg noodles and the scrumptious bowl wafted out  the smell of the deliciousness to come. A perfectly cooked noodle with a fantastic broth were what i came for and received. I told my wife i could eat all my meals here this week. It was that good. I was pretty sure i picked the right place when I noticed the seventy five percent of the customers were Asian. Always a good sign!

They have various different kinds of noodles on the menu, as well as dim sum on the weekends. They don't fall under one category of Asian food, but seem to try to include the entire spectrum. They have pho, Thai, and Chinese dry and soup noodles. I don't remember if there was ramen on the menu, but I did see ramen noodles on their wall display jars of the various noodles they serve. I got the Shrimp Thai Noodle Soup. The menu described it as Tom Yum, but it didn't taste like it at all... It was super bland, I could barely get through it. My brother ordered the beef noodle soup and he usually eats his  plate clean, no matter what, but he said it was too gross to finish. It is overpriced (about $20 per bowl) but I'm not even taking a star off for that because it is expected for every place in Vegas.",2

I also had the oxtail soup which was a pleasant surprise on the menu.  It was prepared very well and the oxtail was very tender and fell easily off the bone.  The wait staff was pleasant albeit a bit slow.  Perhaps not a bad thing given the pace of the city.  You definitely can sit and enjoy your meal.  Very nice atmosphere as well.  Since I am use to good asian food being about 40 to 50 percent less in price this is my only negative.

I've had the regular noodle soup, the wonton noodle soup and the laksa.  They are all good.  The portions are a bit small but you can ask for more broth and buy a bowl of rice to supplement.  

As for the other dishes, they are a bit lacking.  I've had the pad thai which is just ok.  Also, some of the dim sum is not that great (not bad but not good either) and also very pricey (for a few more bucks, you can get the noodle soup).

Started by ordering a Thai Iced Tea. I asked our server if they could substitute the regular milk for soy milk. She told me no... Something about the tea having lots of sugar, plus the sugar in the soy milk... Just too much sugar. Um, what? That doesn't make any sense. It's easy to sub soy in any milk-based drink. I do it all the time. If the drink was pre-mixed with regular milk already, then I can understand. But you're telling me no bc you think I think it'll taste too sugary with soy? Soy doesn't typically have lots of sugar. It's a fine substitute. What if I like lots of sugar, anyhow? I don't. But the point is... It's my drink, personalized to my tastes, and the server doesn't know me... So let me order it how I want to. 

After losing that battle, we ordered our food. My dad got the Noodle Soup with Chicken and again, we got another wonderful recommendation from our server: ""That's not my favorite. It's too light and not very good."" Thanks? We know she meant well, but there may have been a bit of a language barrier (it sounded like she didn't know English very well.) Her recommendations were probably helpful in her eyes, but to us, they sounded discourteous. Luckily my family and I are laid back and we just laughed it off. 

Food: Dad got the Noodle Soup, as requested, and it was actually pretty good. A little bland, but not bad. Same for the Wonton Soup and the Cantonese Dumpling Soup. The fried rice was basic. Don't bother. On the better side... the Shiu Mai and the Sesame Balls.

I know I know that's odd especially since I've only eaten dim sum in Cali. But when I had dim sum, it was the type where you ordered what you wanted by marking it on a piece of paper. I seriously felt like a glutton. I came here with my cousin and her family and I think they were secretly making fun of me because I wanted everything! The lady would come by and I would grab everything from the cart! Hey for my first time at this place, I wanted to try it all! The list of the few items I didn't like is shorter than what I did.

My husband delighted in the pork buns, which had a delightful maple accent. I found them a tad sweet. The steamed chive dumplings were wonderfully savory. I found the calamari a bit greasy and off putting. The duck was tender, but not outstanding. The skin lacked that extra crisp texture. The shumai were fantastic. 

Perhaps I'm being elitist, but I don't understand how any restaurant worth it's salt can't have fresh ground pepper.

Look for the full, hot, steaming carts. Few items=old and cold.

The service was what you would expect for dim sum. If you're looking for something more than descriptive, go elsewhere. The service is fast and the food is plentiful. Don't be afraid to say no, or you'll risk over ordering.

So we stopped and grabbed a bite. The dining area is very large, I was quite surprised. They do Dim Sum all day, which is awesome. The ladies who go around to the tables know what is in each of the dishes too. That's unusual for some of the places I've been. 
We ordered egg rolls, shrimp in lobster sauce, sweet & sour chicken & chicken fried rice. The egg rolls were good, nothing to write home about which is sometimes a good thing. The shrimp in lobster sauce was a little more soupy than we expected, but it was a new dish to us so it was worth a try. The sweet & sour chicken, though, was AMAZING. I have NEVER had such tender chicken in my life. I seriously asked the waiter if this was really chicken. He laughed & said yes. I was completely blown away by how delicious this dish was. For that matter alone, I would go and will go back again.

The cost is reasonable too, two of us ate until we couldn't eat any more and it was about $35. Very busy in there so there is a lot of turn over of food and tables = freshness. I had the cream bun for dessert which was excellent, crusty on the outside but soft and creamy sweet goodness on the inside.

They are well schooled in turning tables but I never saw anyone get rushed.   As a dim sum restaurant should be, it was gloriously noisy with laughter,  children and men toasting with their beer. 
While the clientele is mostly asian most of the cart ladies do speak minimal English I guess because of the restaurant's proximity to the Strip.   BTW...the parking lot is large but tight so be careful in playing bumper cars.
The food is well executed and fresh.  The carts do move fast so you sometimes have to shout (politely of course) to get them to stop.  The Chinese broccoli was cooked and still crunchy,  the Chinese meatballs were soft and unctuous!   The chicken feet were savory and melt in your mouth!  I only wish there was a bit more of the stock they were simmered in...  The shu mai were tasty and steamed well.  I didn't see any tripe dishes offered but I could have missed them   As I was getting full I saw some of the steamed clams go by...will try next time.  I finished with sweet tofu and ginger syrup.  I love it!  
Best of all. ...all that food for $20....better quality food and service than Harbor Palace in Chinatown Square.

Disappointed that they don't have the fried seaweed roll and they don't automaticAlly serve the mustard/chili combo sauce. Towards the middle of our meal, my friend was speechless and immobilized as a small cockroach started walking across the table in front of her, it was small and didn't touch the food, but it's still a cockroach!!

Weak tea and decent food. Sometimes the carts take forever to make it back to you but some carts seem to stop by every 5 minutes. It's always the ones we want that never seem to come around.

The service is pretty good though, and the hosts and cart ladies are always attentive and err on the friendly side, despite the fact that I am Chinese and cannot speak it (which is apparently a sin). Prices are also attractive, especially for a light lunch or for those who don't prefer to stuff themselves senseless.

Any dishes with noodles (such as the big fat ones with shrimp inside) are okay - not the softest but still satisfies my craving. Harkow and shumai is decent as well. I always like getting beef tendon, egg tarts, and this crispy fluffy taro bun.

I've never had to wait but the majority of tables in the wide-open eating space is occupied. Of course, my favorite aspect of Orchids is the consistency.

Came in for an early dinner at about 6PM.
Love how they have the cart ladies circulating around with goodies- so many places in SF simply have you order from the menu and only have carts on Sundays or lunch service. Here you can do carts and also order menu dishes if you want.

We got probably half the menu, including shrimp shu mai (tasty), shark dumplings (have to try), shrimp noodle roll (personal fave), fried shrimp ball (BF's fave), crab ball (star of the night, at $7/a pair), steamed pork bun (mediocre), chinese broccoli (must-have) and duck (which we didn't need at all but was tasty- especially with the sauce).

Made the mistake of ordering the soup dumplings, which they said would take 10 minutes- and we waited and waited and waited. And my eyes are bigger than my stomach, so I got steamed pork buns while I waited (way too sweet, did not even finish one).  The lady told us they were ""coming right out"" four times. Eventually it was a solid half hour to get our three soup dumplings- and they weren't very good, and only had about a sip of soup inside of them. Underwhelming, would not get again.

We spent just shy of $50, which is absurd for dim sum, but predictable for our over-ordering habits. It's probably also why we only have dim sum once every month or two. Dining room is nice, much larger than expected though you san see it's a large place from the outside. Service was friendly and attentive throughout, other than that ridiculous wait for the soup dumplings.",4

I'm from SoCal and I've been to soooo many different places and different restaurant to eat dim sum: San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Mexico, China, Hong Kong, etc. But I have to say Orchids Garden is definitely one of the top dim sum restaurants that I have ever been to. There prices are reasonably and the proportions and good for the price we pay. The taste of the food is absolutely amazing and delicious. Full of flavor in every bite! I didn't get to try everything but I definitely got to try a lot of them that they served. I would say 80% of what we ordered, I enjoyed. 

My favorites:
- Steamed chicken feet 
- Pork shiu mai (must try!)
- Steamed beef balls
- Steamed beef ribs 
- Sweet tofu (the ginger doesn't overpower the sweetness flavor which I really like)

I would have given this place a 5 star but the service was horrible. The host gave me a number  and told us the wait was around 15 mins. After waiting for about 25-30 mins, we went to go check our number on the wait and the host completely forgot to write down our number before she gave it to us so she's been skipping us the entire time when we were right in front of her waiting for our table. Good thing we went up to her to check and she sat us immediately right after. After being seated, we waited another 15 mins and I got really upset so my friend and I had to get up and tell the lady cleaning the table next to us if she can bring us some carts because we've been waiting for so long. She was very understanding and went to go get a cart and we went crazy and got at least 8-10 dishes at once hahaha. Even though the service was bad, this place still deserves a good review.

467796,GSX16fcyqOafnGtmNUpYEg,23SJEjfyU5gxY2chAKhgcw,"I have to agree with my friends, Ms. Stefany and Phillip T.

""The options for Dim Sum are limted in Las Vegas"".  This as good as you are going to find for Dim Sum in Las Vegas. 

Unlike Cathy House, and other Chinese establishments in Las Vegas, the Dim Sum is prepared throughout the day, so you will get fresh, and not reheated, Dim Sum when the carts come around.

I always do the Dim Sum. My wife used to order Chinese entrees, until she finally realized they were not that good, and switched back to Dim Sum. 

The place is large, and at lunch time, very loud. Dinner is a little less hectic.

Service is on the slow side. In the Asian tradition, don't be affraid to raise your voice to get service at your table, or they may ignore you. 

They don't expect much of a tip, and don't appreciate a generous tip. Many of the Chinese patrons dont' tip; it's a cultural thing. 

If you are on a date, and want to impress someone with your knowledge for ""off the strip"" or ""local"" places, or simply to introduce some one to Dim Sum, this is a decent bet.

The only negative was that some of the workers pushing the carts were almost impossible to understand when explaining what they had to offer.  We spent a lot of time saying ""What?""",5

My party of 4 was quickly seated on a Saturday afternoon. The carts had a good selection of everything we typically order. 

Chicken feet
Pork spareribs 
Shrimp har gow
Pork shumai 
Fried Taro cake
Fried Pork and shrimp wontons
Fried shrimp balls on crab claws
Rice noodles rolls with shrimp (banh uot tom)
Bbq pork bun
Chinese broccoli (cai lan)
Congee (chao)

Everything tasted average, and some dishes lacked the finesse and flavor that we're used to from the CA dim sum houses. 

The rice noodle rolls with shrimp weren't that great. It's upsetting since this is my absolute favorite dim sum dish. The noodle rolls were too dense. Also, sweet soy sauce was lacking flavor, it tasted watered down. 

The bbq pork buns had a tiny bit of bbq pork filling, it was mostly bread.

The fried taro cake was greasier than it should of been.",2

But oh my god, little did I know that this tiny dim sum place I found in Vegas would be so good!!! Best dim sum experience I've ever had and I plan to come here to get dim sum every time I come to Vegas :)

Not only are there good dim sum here, it is so cheap as well!! AND they serve dim sum all day!!!! I recommend people to come here around 1ish after big wave of people have died down. The parking lot is also really big so no worries about trying to find parking! Also it is away from the strip so the wait is not long at all!

Like any dim sum place, getting a seat is easy but getting the attention of the dim sum cart ladies are so difficult :( After a while of waiting I got impatient so asked the manager to see where the carts were at. She immediately brought the carts over herself and served us right away. Great customer service!!! I really appreciated that and boy my group ordered half from that cart!

The quality of all of the dim sum were really good and definitely satisfied my cravings. ^_^ I will be seeing you soon when I'm in Vegas!!!

I recommend:
- Chicken Feet
- Steamed BBQ Pork Bun
- Shrimp Har Gow
- Mushroom Shiu Mai
- Pork Shiu Mai
- Sweet Tofu
- JUST TRY ANYTHING YOU SEE its so good!!!",4

I informed my friend that dim sum is a combination of Cantonese fast food except them come to your table in carts and each server tries their best to sell you what is comparable to ""Tapas or appetizers."" I pick the traditional dishes and guess what my friend chose? He picks out ""Chicken Feet,"" brave soul! Anyways the food is average, the portions are smaller than East Ocean and it's a little pricey. But I've got to give it props because when I looked around my friend was the only Caucasian in the room which means many Asians really like this place. Overall it's not a bad place.",3

So I tried it out again with my mother today and I have to say the food was not bad. It was a typical Chinese restaurant but definitely a couple steps higher than the Chinese buffet. I had the chicken chow mein which was rather salty but pretty good. My mother had the moo goo gai pan which was decent. 
The service definitely was bad to say the least. I understand that we're right at the edge of Chinatown, however there was an entire staff that had a giant language barrier with me and my mother. After being in business all these years in America, you would think that the English would be getting a little bit better and better. Not so much. We sat down to eat ordered our food and then they brought it out in a to go box. Maybe they were trying to gives a hint to leave? Maybe because I had my 18-month-old son with me and they were dreading having to clean up after him? Honestly whatever the reason was they didn't get that we were there to dying in considering they set us we placed our order. They then brought our food which was lukewarm out to us to our plates to service and never refilled our water. When we get ready to pay we waited in line go to the cashier and realize that they just recently got a B rating from the health District. I wasn't that much of a happy camper.

There are many other amazing Chinese restaurants as well as Chinese fusion restaurants and Thai restaurants in town but I feel more comfortable eating at. I tried this place because it's a little relieved .1 miles from my house. But I don't think I'll be going here again.",3

The restaurant is extremely packed during lunch hours on weekends but the table turnover rate is super high; so, if you have just 4-6 people in a party, you prolly just have to wait around 15 minutes to be seated.  Anyhoo, the dim sum is totally worth the wait!  

The four of us had a lot of dim sum (see pictures) of which all were delicious, and the bill came out to be only $47, including tax and tips already!  My most favorite dim sum was the fried taro puff pastry, inside which the taro paste was savory and velvety like melted, and the puff pastry was light and crispy!  I LOOOOVVVED IT!!",4

One of the better dim sum places I've been to; the only better ones are in the bay area. Service is usually mediocre at all dim sum places, but this one was better than others.  The food quality was great; it has everything that a usual dim sum place has.  I was also happy that they had thai tea, which tasted great.

i will say this place is reasonably priced and there is a couple things that i find very tasty here.. 

Chicken Feet (4/5)
Beef tendon (4/5) Both of these dishes are awesome and taste great. 

fried taro puffs my favorite thing (3/5 sometimes when you bite into this it leaves an iodine type smell that i find annoying sometimes)

Now SHUMAI AND HAR-GO ( also my favorites) i rate 2/5 they need some work in this area this is your go to items and they should shine

Tofu Fa( hot tofu sweet dessert or starter ) 4/5 this is pretty good here its perfectly sweet and the tofu is very smooth. the issue i have sometimes at places when they dont execute this dish is that the texture of the tofu is grainy so i tend not to finsih but here i do .

BEST THING ON THE MENU
( Baked Bbq pork Cha Su Bao) the sticky one 5/5 this is my favorite thing here its so tasty and they put this sticky glaze on it to finish the first bite of this dish is awesome and i always tend to order this to go or i stack my table with 3 orders and take the rest home. its a good leftover as well

Orchids boasted of its giant dining and 24-hr dim sum service, but from what I could tell, that was the source of all its problems. It was near impossible to flag down carts with their ill-tempered servers, and the food was usually lukewarm, sometimes even cold. Reminiscent of mass processed foods, dim sum here was oily, skimpy, and of such poor quality I could barely tell meat from grease. The room is pure chaos, noisy and unorganized, with empty tables sitting uncleared, piled with dirty dishes. All this, for more than $20 per person. I could barely eat.

The dim sum was pretty good considering it was in the evening. The sui mai was soft and pretty juicy. The shrimp balls were big and tasted great with the sweet mayo.  And I cannot recommend soy sauce mixed with some chili oil enough!

We came here for an early dinner, 4:30ish, so we figured we were either going to get the fresh stuff they began preparing for dinner, or the bottom-of-the-barrel leftover from the lunch crowd.  Well, either they continuously make them or we got the first dinner batch, because everything was fresh.  

After the somewhat frustrating experience at Ping Pang Pong with not enough of what I wanted, I was not-so-secretly hoping the menu would be more to my liking.  I was not disappointed.  Plenty of shu mai, dumplings, and har gows to satisfy my cravings.  The pork and shrimp based pieces were fresh and tasty, with a couple of complaints;  1) the rice wrappings on the har gow and rice noodle rolls had too much flour-y taste to them, and 2) the rice noodle rolls had too much of the rice noodles for the amount of shrimp.  Not sure there should be flour taste in rice noodles...  But otherwise, the shu mais and dumplings were great, and the pimento stuffed with shrimp dim sum was fantastic.  And the sweet cream buns were yummy too.  

Clean setting, fresh and mostly delish dim sums, and timeliness all add up to a satisfying experience.  Service is typically terse for dim sum joints, although there were spots of smiles and courtesy here and there.  We might also want to try some regular menus here, although I'm not sure how we'd resist the temptation of the rolling carts!

While the quality is definitely not on par with the 626 in California, it was decent and the service was quick. Not sure if speaking Canto helped, but god damn they came by immediately and if one of the ladies didn't have what we wanted, the manager or hostess near by would place that order on the quickness.

We have a lot of places to compare to, so we weren't expecting extraordinary food. However, we were pleasantly surprised to find this gem on the way to a gun range. Stopped in for lunch, it was excellent! The dim sum was very fresh and tasty, with a wide variety to choose from. My favorite was the ginger tripe and the hubs loved the tendon dish. We also ordered the house special fried rice....it was good, but not anything special. I have to admit, the service was beyond excellent - the staff was attentive, fast and nice, nothing like what we're used to at other chinese restaurants. The prices here are a little high given what we ordered, but we'll definitely be back again. You can't beat all day dim sum :)",4

This place was recommended by a few different friends.  Service was quick and friendly.  I was prepared to be rushed and not know what anything was but they actually told us what everything on the cart was (it wasn't busy....and us gringos didn't understand everything but tried most of it anyway).  It's good to know for your first time that the most expensive cart comes out first...but that's where the good stuff if!  The crab and shrimp balls we got were yummy.  The wonton (? i think?  It looks like a haystack) wrapped shrimp ball was my fav!  I'd return again.,4

A friend invited several of us to celebrate her successful completion of her doctoral degree and to enjoy some dishes.  We chose a variety of dishes, including the chicken feet, the Chinese broccoli, the pork dumplings, turnip cakes, and Peking duck. 

Pros: plenty of parking, clean and updated bathroom (the sinks were those fancy glass basins that sit on top of the counter), and clean floor (yes, worth mentioning IMO!).  Service was pretty good, perhaps due to my friend being Taiwanese and speaking Cantonese!  The cart ladies came around often and prices seem reasonable, but I wouldn't know for certain because my friend treated us to dinner.  (Nice or what?)  

Cons: personally, I liked the broccoli, pork dumplings, and turnip cakes the best.  I found the chicken feet greasy and lacking in texture; the skin tasted cold and sort of like congealed fat.  Same with the duck; while I enjoyed the flavor of the actual duck meat with the accompanying sauce, I thought the skin was more limp than crisp, which detracted from my overall enjoyment.

Nothing was horrible, but nothing stood out as stellar.  It was a fun evening with some friends and I'm glad to have sampled some dim sum again, but I think I'll check out another Asian eatery next time.",3

First, with party of 25, mgr only wanted to give us 2 tables to fit 25 people. We requested 3 tables, first we got a big fat ""NO"". When I turned my back and start walking out, half way walk to out side, mgr changed mind to said ""yes"".  I could take this business to anywhere else yet family started arriving. By the the of dining, restaurant never reach 80% fill

Sanitary issue: 
This restaurant mixed drinking serve water glasses to guest with dirty dish tray on the same cart! 

Pissed poor services:
dim sum cart keep passed with no stop even I ran after it, it won't come by. Until I called mgr to the table to ask why, then we start getting food. Employees were arguing loud with each other, fighting each other, giving orders to others. Bad manners.. Server even took time to argue with me because I want to add order to the my table, which turned into forever food below..

Only table who did the family style order got their food as their order.

Forever food:
Pork belly and preserve vegetable takes 30 minutes? Why even bother put in the menu? Dim sum we want never available, next cart(x4) later.. Still nothing. 

Ordering:
Try to order a simple cold chicken with ginger sauce, 20 minutes. Restaurant

Yes it's Chinese restaurant and what will I expect right?, and No, I am not stereotyping all Chinese restaurants, but this particular one for sure is the worst and beats all the stereotypical Chinese joints!
Not just the language barrier but gees, the stinky attitude, the napkins that I requested since I sat down over an hour ago, the response I am getting. Now how the hell do you expect people to keep coming back here? Or Write a positive review? For the last 8 years I've been dining here, I will not be coming back here again!!!

This used to be my most favorite restaurant in Vegas for its high quality authentic cantonese cuisine...yet the most recent visit proved to a a disaster...this place had lost its authentic cantonese taste, the pan fried noodle was saturated with gravy, my pan fried shrimp was over filled with sweet and sour sauce (it was supposed to be dry), and the beef rib tasted just gross. Service is ok; but I would say that food had downgraded to American Chinese food style...I will not come back.",3

The Scallop Hot Pot had very tender scallop meat and a generous amount of garlic, but was surprisingly bland, especially for the number of garlic cloves. It was almost as if it was watered down. 

The server talked us out of the Tea Smoked Duck and into the the Crisp Roasted Chicken with Scallions, which turned out to be simply a fairly standard dish, nothing to get excited about. It tasted predominantly of soy sauce and was fairly tender. 

The Cantonese Sausage Fried Rice was the better of the three dishes. It had a nice lingering flavor, and came in a very generous portion. Still not terribly exciting.

On a more minor note, the Thai iced tea was wanting. It simply did not have the full flavor I have found at most other restaurants.",2
481333,y2PiytDufazRc0KN2ulcsg,tI3J5jomrBs--n7r92186g,Truly authentic Chinese food. You can tell by the fact that 99% of the patrons were Chinese.

I refused and thanked her for offering. After a couple of bites i had staff pack up order. I ended up giving left overs to homeless people on the street! I wonder if they were happy?,1

My Hong Kong-hailing real estate agent was visibly horrified when he found out in casual conversation that my parents and I had not yet been privy to the local dim sum experience at Ping Pang Pong (how is anyone supposed to take me seriously when I say this aloud?) in the Gold Coast casino. So while showing us detailed French doors, luxurious hardwood flooring, and expansive high ceilings, he kept peppering home features with ""shao mai"" and ""cha shao bao."" I was sold - on the food, not the house - so not long after that, it was off to Gold Coast we went. 

The casino is not the most convenient to navigate, but the restaurant sits pretty much smack dab in the middle of it, and that's where my biggest issue with it lay. The restaurant is open to the casino pits with hip-level pillars that whisper, ""Smoky Smokerson! Enter, please."" On the flip side, however, the dim sum is solid. Every dish we hailed off the cart was well-prepared and got a stamp of approval. The xia jiao, chicken feet, congee - all good in the hood. It's just that this hood carries a bit of an eau de FUMAR!",3

*service is unheard of at most dim sum restaurants. 

The food is delicious here and definitely one of the best dim sum spots in town! Everything tastes as it should and nothing is overly salty or overpowering in anyway. Shrimp ball, beef ball with and without tofu, shrimp dumpling, shu-mai, tripe and pork ribs... everything was perfect. 

The amazing thing here is that, not only is there service, but the staff is friendly as well! The carts come around more often than not and if you ask for something in particular, they will either bring it out to you or let you know if and when that cart is going to be making it's way back around to you. 

Try doing that at any other dim sum place here in Vegas! Not going to happen.",4
481340,EgS11KpVWUSGk44zKfwRYQ,tI3J5jomrBs--n7r92186g,"Whoa, second day in a row that I picked a place with a huge crowd and a wait.

I think I could've legitimately done without the wait. They have a sign pointing to a waiting area just outside of the restaurant, but they didn't seem to have a dedicated host. I stood there for at least 5 minutes before they even so much as said hi to the party in front of us, and another 5 before they seated us. It was very busy, but at least I should've been welcomed, and I'm pretty sure there were at least a couple of open tables.

By the way, try to park at the side of Gold Coast farthest from the Rio if you want to have a shorter walk, which is healthier than it sounds due to less secondhand smoke exposure.

Anyway, as with any good dim sum place, we were able to dive right in since the carts made their rounds quickly. My friend started off the picks with a har gow (4 pieces), a shu mai (4), and a rather large and unfamiliar bowl of some sort of tripe with ginger and daikon. I later got us a plate of shrimp stuffed eggplant pieces (3), some deep fried shrimp balls with sugar cane (2) and some nice compact egg tarts (2). The last item was the chicken feet that my friend was pining for the whole time.

Everything was definitely on the high end of good. All the savory items had sufficient flavor and non-mushiness, and the egg tarts were very flaky and were still noticeably warm at the end of the meal even though I'd ordered them at the start. I didn't fall in love with any one dish, but the quality was solid overall. Prices are probably a bit more than you'd expect since it's a casino restaurant and there's not all that many dim sum shops here. It was most likely $5.88 each for the tripe bowl and chicken feet, per my friend, and we had one $2.18 order, four $2.88 items, and one $3.88 dish. Couldn't tell you which is which since I'm not that much of a dim sum connoisseur, sorry! 

Overall, I wasn't blown away by any single item, but it was solid dim sum and I definitely prefer this to East Ocean, which has seemed a little lacking for me the past couple of trips for some reason. I also definitely appreciated that we got a tangerine and candy here instead of a fortune cookie (looking at you, East Ocean). I have not been to KJ yet, so stay tuned in case I decide to hit them up.",4
481341,vcxEkiHi9nOqZjs_PIevAQ,tI3J5jomrBs--n7r92186g,"Ja Leung (donuts that aren't) are pretty great here. If it's noon you'll have a short wait, and it could be longer if you have a big group. There were 6-10 groups in front of us on a Saturday and we were seated within 20 minutes. 

The servers will direct you to the more bland and gringo-safe food if you're not Chinese so make sure you ask them about the things they don't offer that are on their carts and pay attention to the items that the regulars all select and you'll be happy. We got a spicy snail dish only because we saw it and asked about it. It was nice if you're okay with chewy snails, but it being on our table also encouraged some servers to offer us stuff on their second pass that wasn't offered the first time round. 

It was pretty cheap based on my experiences in LA. We had enough food for three people to stuff themselves silly and paid about $60. We'll be back for at least a few more visits before moving on to the next place for dim sum in town.",4
481342,d_P4XUznsg-gc434qvNJvA,tI3J5jomrBs--n7r92186g,"Ping Pang Pong is a go to place for when some of my friends want to get together for crab. Their style of spicy and salty is probably the best. It is all about getting well rounded flavors and plenty of food. Their razor clams and scallops on the half shell are a steal. At $8 for four and two respectively is a steal. I could eat those all night. Just be warned that your breath will be kicking. So much fried garlic goes on top of both dishes. 

PPP is a hit or miss. The green tea smoked duck was not something we enjoyed. I ended up just wanting Peking duck and was sad to see that they don't offer it. The sweet and pungent lotus roots are always a must. Add that with the three dishes I list above and you don't really need anything else. 

The dim sum here is good. It is just pricey compared to other places. 

Just be prepared. Don't expect great service. Just know something might go wrong during the meal and just move on. The food is good.",4

If you want to be adventurous try the Chicken Feet.I tend not to order this stuff at the normal Dim Sum place, I usually get grossed out by claws still being a attached to the feat.

Fortunately, it was a fluke. Ping Pang Pong was DANG near as good as our usual haunt in Portland. The service was good, the food was great, and specialty items were quickly cooked and served to us if they weren't already on the carts. My favorite little indulgence here was the coconut custard bun. Ambrosia! Another of our favorite dim sum stables is the stuffed eggplant, har gow, and sui mai- Ping Pang Pong delivered on all of them!",4

While walking over I noticed the sign for Ping Pang Pong's and I remember seeing great reviews for the place. My husband was excited because he had been in the mood for Chinese food. 

After arriving at the restaurant and being seated the server came and took our order. Mind you there were only 4 of us and we decided on just a few items: The Kung Pao Chicken, Beef and Broccoli and fried rice. After we placed our order we were brought the waters that we requested. An hour later we still did not have our food. We tried a number of times to flag down our server or anyone that could tell us what was up with our food...we were basically ignored.

I wanted to try a couple of the Dim Sum items, so I ordered the Baked Pork Bun, and HALLELUJAH! This right here, BAKED PORK BUN, is the BIDNIZZZ (business). If you want to try one thing, please let this be it! 

A couple weeks later, I told my friend about my dim sum craving and recommended this place. This time we were actually here for the dim sum. We ordered every single thing off the dim sum menu. Don't worry, there were about 10 or less items all $3 each.  After getting to taste them all, MY TUMMY WAS HAPPY. 

It was then time for dessert, but the server did not notice... We waited and waited, and stared into the sky, hoping they would acknowledge us. & they finally did! 30 minutes later... Thank goodness the egg custard dessert was BOMB.ORG, because it slightly made up for the time lost!

Food was really good! Really enjoyed the fresh veggies and the salted pepper pork chops were really tender but so flavorful. The noodles, roasted duck, and honey walnut shrimp were average. Everyone got full quick! 

All in all, it was a good meal!",4

But when I'm handed a 16 dollar check for three small pork buns, two teas and two plates of small potstickers I gasp.

Because in Chinatown, heck, in any Dim Sum place I've been to in the last five years, that is outlandishly priced.

But hey, maybe all Dim Sum makers decided to up the price all at once and no one told me. Maybe it's just Nevada. No? Just triple P?

Good to know.

The service was good for cart Dim Sum, but again, we didn't revisit during our trip due to the price.

If we return we'll most likely skip it. I'd rather head to TGIF and get a huge place of food for less than that.",3

The food is fine.  It's not close to the best Chinese food I've had.  It's a bit greasy, at times overcooked, and occasionally a bit bland.  We sampled some meat dishes, vegetable dishes, and even some dim sum.

This left me wondering how this place gets such raves.  One thing, they serve some exotic dishes, dishes I don't see in other places.  I suspect this is one of the attractions.

The service is fine.  The place is often busy, and they do their best to hustle people in and out.

Overall, the place is a ""a-ok"", 3 stars.",3
481358,uqBWTf0ycvAYAoskf0Whfg,tI3J5jomrBs--n7r92186g,"Maybe because I am in Vegas and are fed up with resort-type pseudo Chinese food that cost a fortune so whenever I encounter a dim sum restaurant that's half-way decent, I don't mind giving it a higher rating.

Ping Pang Pong - let's just called it PPP - is also located within a Casino, namely the Gold Coast. The one big differentiation about this restaurant as opposed to others is that it's located far off the strip so the patrons are not visitors that just happen to walk by here. Most of the customers appear to be locals who drove here for the food.

For the most part the dishes are pretty tasty and fresh with high turnover rate. The roast duck was succulent, the salt and pepper smelt and the baked BBQ pork puff were delicious. We ordered a plate of stir-fried pea sprout greens and it was cooked just right. 

One of the desserts was recommended by the restaurant and they are these red bean filled circular donut-like pastries dusted with granulated sugar. I find them to be overrated as the crust was dry and the filling was overly sweet.

Other than that PPP is a good place to go in Vegas for dim sum.",4

Where should I begin... FIRST OF ALL, they open at 10am, but don't have any food ready. We placed an order for a few dim sums at 10:10 am and got our order at 11am. UNACCEPTABLE, REALLY? 50 mins for dim sum?! Servers could barely speak english, messed up our order and manager was too busy to care. 

ALSO, the worst part is dim sum cart lady DROPPED food on the wet, dirty ground and procedded to place it back on the plate and back into the cart to be served to unknowing customers. GROSS, LADY..GROSS. I had to ask her to throw it away and she at first said "" it's okay."" WTH. NO LADY, IT'S NOT OKAY. No worries, I made sure she threw it in the trash..where it belongs. 

Finally we get our food at 11, after asking multiple times and our consolation prize for their mistakes were some cookies.. WOOHOO. Probably the ones that fell on the floor...

Gold Coast Casino towards the back wall. We came at about 2 pm on a Monday (Memorial Day) and there was still a long line (about 15 minutes). Get here early, they close at 3, but it looks like they stop making fresh dim sum at 2 pm. The carts had slim pickings and a lot of things they didn't have anymore, such as the shrimp noodle rolls. 

I knocked a star off for the bad service here. The service was extremely slow and rude. After we were seated, no one introduced themselves to us as our server, so we didn't even know who our server was the entire time. Our drink order wasn't taken and tea wasn't brought to us until about 15 minutes after being seated and us having to flag someone down. They don't refill drinks here and they never made eye contact, so I was constantly waving my hand in the air to call someone, anyone over. 

Surprisingly, most of the dim sum here was great! 

BBQ pork buns - We loved the bbq pork buns, they make a great one here. The moist fluffy bao buns (the white ones that look like clouds) were stuffed generously with moist and tender bbq pork. 5/5

Chicken Feet - whoever butchered the feet, didn't do a good job and there were tiny shards of bone throughout. My boyfriend almost swallowed a couple of small shards. 1/5

Shumai (pork dumpling) - small, but they were moist, flavorful and had a nice texture. 5/5

Har gow (clear shrimp dumpling) - these were also small, but I loved these! Great flavor on the shrimp filling and the clear wrapping was delicate and had a perfect texture. We ordered 2 rounds of them. 5/5

Fried shrimp patty on sugar cane - comes with a sweet mayo sauce. The shrimp ball was very flavorful and went perfect with the mayo sauce. 5/5

Shrimp and vegetable meatball coated in sticky rice - I didn't like the doughy sticky rice on the outside. Also the filling's texture was odd with the soft shrimp ball and chewy bits of vegetable. 1/5

We also ordered a plate of stir fried beef chow mein noodles because we were all still hungry and they barely had anymore dim sum by 2:30 pm. The chow mein noodles were really bland. The beef was tender, but we all couldn't get past on the taste of the chow mein, it was lacking so much! 1/5

Ordered a bunch of dim sum: Har gow, shu mai, shrimp rolled in flat noodles, fried shrimp ball with sugarcane, beef ribs, this vegetarian tofu dish, meatballs, steamed bbq pork buns, baked pork buns, green tea dessert (it had a mochi texture) and jasmine green tea. What a breakfast!",4
481366,RG5poFHfiiivk5R1F0Ielw,tI3J5jomrBs--n7r92186g,"In all my years of coming to Las Vegas I never knew really good and authentic Chinese food even existed here. Like others have mentioned, this certainly is a hidden gem.

A couple of friends attending the jewelry trade show at the Mandalay had invited me to a nice quiet high end dinner at the Jasmine Restaurant at the Bellagio when , just as we were about to leave for the Bellagio, my friend received a business call saying their business contacts wanted to invite us for dinner instead.....and were too afraid to decline. All I knew was that I was asked to get in the car and just follow the leader.

Being the fish out of water, I didn't speak a or understand a word of Chinese and had no idea what the plan was. We eventually ended up off the strip at some big stand alone casino across from the Palms Hotel and Casino. As we walked into the casino from the parking garage, my friend whispered to me that the host was taking us to a Chinese restaurant, and if she eats hear you can bet it's going to be VERY good! The host has been living in Vegas for over 30 years so she should know where all the good eating spots are now.....ok, so in we go. This was a medium end casino, and as we walked through it we finally came upon this Chinese Restaurant called ""Ping Pang Pong""..... yes, you got that right....just as I've spelled it. Flashbacks of the movie ""16 Candles"" flashed through my head, but I'll leave that one alone :)

Tucked inside the casino is this very casual, very Chinese looking, restaurant with an open kitchen concept where you can hear the burners blasting away and the woks clanging away. The place was quite crowded, but it appeared our host knew everybody there and I was told she is a VIP guest there. We came to the table and there sat 4 other of her elderly friends already seating and waiting for us. Oh boy.....there goes my hopes for a peaceful and relaxing dinner. Ok, lets cut it short and say that it was a very typical large table seating for a group of elderly folk who enjoyed their meals with loud talk.....the red wine they were gulping down didn't seem to help matters either. Anyway, I did not understand a single word spoken at the table all night, but no worries.....I had food to keep me busy!......good authentic Chinese food at that! And note, when I say this is authentic food, I mean authentic.....PF Chang's and Panda Express are NOT authentic :P

I pretty much left the ordering to the host and her friends since they seemed to know what good Chinese food should taste like. Needless to say they ordered all very authentic dishes that westerners likely wouldn't have known how to order. Without going into too much detail about each dish.....because I really can't remember the names of each one......we started off with lotus root soup which was very good....absolutely delicious, and coincidentally is my favorite Chinese soup! There was a roast duck dish, lotus root stir fried with celery and rice wine sauce, egg white fried rice with dried scallops, stir fried cubes of beef with a dark brown sauce, ginger and scallion lobster over noodles, farm raised chicken cooked with chestnuts and rice wine, some green vegetables with baby abalone and sauce, sea bass steamed with black beans, ............and I think that was it. It was ALL yummy, and I was really surprised at finding this quality and standard of Chinese food all the way out here! But yes, it exists. Yay! :)

All these delicious dishes for 9 people came to about $295 before tips, which was actually pretty good given the excellent quality of the food. If I should ever find several friends who'll join me for a good Chinese meal during future visits, I will definitely bring them here!",5

I have been lucky to dine in at times when it wasn't really crowded, but I have seen those long lines.  I love their shumai and hair gow.  Their shrimp noodles are even good.  The skins are not falling off and the fillings are just right.  I like this place better than Chinatown in LA.

Getting in is the hard part-- you stand in line with a crowd of people yelling in various Chinese dialects as they shove, cut, and complain-- all adding authenticity and closely matching my experiences in China.  Another reason for the long wait is, once inside, diners tend to linger. I don't blame them. The food is tasty, hot, and well-varied. All my favorite dim sum dishes were here.  Servers are friendly and I never felt ignored (as I have at other dim sum places).  For about $18 including tip I was able to stuff myself.

The porridge was okay - it was actually kind of bland and I wish I had salt. The Wonton soup was not any better - the noodles were stuck together and the wonton was also very bland. 

So even after trying the food here and knowing its not that good- why would I come back again? Well my dad didn't think it was so bad so the next day he wanted to order the same thing - I really didn't want to but he insisted he wanted to eat porridge - so this time we went to order it for take out again.

This time I experienced the service -- and it was ridiculous - took 45 minutes for two dishes...on top of that the waitress was very unfriendly. The chef didn't even remember to make the porridge until I asked the waitress three times after 30 minutes - and she finally asked the chef - which was just standing around - to make it. It took him less than 5 minutes to make it but I waited 45 minutes for it. Then after that I asked her for an extra spoon and she didn't even want to give it. On top

Definitely not a place I want to go back to. Both the food I tried and the service I experienced was pretty bad. On top of that they were pretty expensive.",1

We sat down right around 1:45... What happened to the carts?? The same 2 carts came round and round. We asked for a few items and the person said ""later"" and kept on walking. We were so disappointed!! We heard the food was great, ""best in LV"" and we got a total of 5 dim sum plates of food, nothing we really wanted, but we were so hungry!  One thing this town has no shortage of is good restaurants, so we won't be back and suggest others not waste their time if they are hungry. What we ate was okay, nothing special.

Overall, the dim sum was quite tasty.  The dishes we enjoyed the most were the assorted sweet and savory buns as well as the Shrimp Cheong Fun with plump shrimps.  The Sui Miu was tasty with the right amount of meat as was the tofu wrap.

There were a few misses.  The shrimp dumpling (har gow) was bland tasting shrimp with mushy, thick wrap. The Rice w/ Lotus Leaf (Lo Mai Gai) was mostly rice with minimal amount of meat and other ingredients.  The fried chicken wings were the worse with an odd mix of spices and too much grease.  We also ordered an item with rice and small spareribs. It was tasty but some of the ribs were fatty.

We were at the table where all the employees had to open the cabinet to put their personal items so we had to keep moving out of the way. The food carts seemed to have been sparse in our area but we were able to order what we wanted from the server. My favorites were the shrimp churn fun and the gai mei bao. The shrimp
was huge! All of the food was good but I wish we got to have more of a variety like the turnip cake that I love or tripe.

Most of the time we eat between 12 and 3am so they usually run out of the crispy chicken by then. Once we came at 7pm and the crispy chicken came out 5 minutes after we ordered it but it wasn't even crispy. The other 3 times it's been great. We like it spicy. 

Dishes we don't like: hot and sour soup. It's not hot or sour... Just big. Wrinkly string beans - sounds exactly like what it is - wrinkly string beans, not the yummiest vege choice! 

Dishes that are average: won ton noodle soup - it's also massive and has lots of veges, chicken feet - flavour is ok.

Got a comp for this place.  Ordered it at 10:50 for to-go; had to go up and play 11PM bingo.  I knew 10 minutes was short but you figure Chinese food doesn't take long to cook.

Lady says ""14 minutes""; of course we think  ""14 minutes"" but I think she meant ""40"".  That's ok though, but my friend did go downstairs to check on our food twice. 

We ordered roast duck, fried rice and pork chop.  Unless you're chasing down Donald Duck and Porky Pig, I think 40 minutes it's more than enough for ""to-go"" food.  My friend who witnessed us ordering saw a family of 5 sit down and leave by the time we came back from bingo an hour later.

So we asked to just eat our food right then and there; I mean, bingo ends at 12am and it was 12:05, 15 min after our food was supposed to be done.  

Grateful to sit and eat we did.
 Minus service.  Had to wait super long before we asked for our check (just happened to be a to be a drink balance of $3...)

Monday night, slow service.  I really don't understand this; what pisses me off is that my food was a comp:  doesn't that mean VIP?  I didn't get my meal for ""free"", so don't treat me like I'm nobody.  I gamble a lot.  I can't rely on feeling ""VIP"" at this place.

Their portion is smaller as well. As in, most places give you 3 egg tarts and this place gives you 2. Same for other dishes like the rice wrapped with leaves. 

Compared to DJ Dim Sum in Rio, this place has a major thumbs down in food and in service for sure. Don't think I'll ever come back.",2

481394,GkMCUlpqT9xDCkP6QZEU7A,tI3J5jomrBs--n7r92186g,"One of my highlights during my recent trip to Vegas was visiting Gold Coast where I tried the slot machines and came out ahead with some change.  And then visiting Ping Pang Pong for lunch and dinner.  PPP offers authentic Chinese dim sum with some unique items which I don't see in SCal, or maybe I have yet to visit to the ones that serve the similar dim sum fare.  Chill waitresses, friendly service, they are more than happy to show you what's in those little tins from their carts. 

The porridge with century old eggs was very satisfying, I was half full after eating it.  Enough century old egg pieces in it to qualify for the name if you know what I mean.  Here is my YAY!(‿) 

The slow cooked/simmered snails ($5.88) on dim sum menu is probably quite common in Hong Kong, but it's rare in the States.  Definitely a winner.  They were easy to be taken out from the shell, nothing broke off in the process, marvelous!  I enjoy doing that!  They were very flavorful, slightly spicy but not too spicy and had a nice chewiness to them.  What a treat!  Good times. ()

The shrimp ball with sticky rice is a variation from the well known 绵阳三蒸，but theirs have more vegetable matter and less shrimp matter than I expected.  Still good though, and goes well with the egg white dipping sauce.  

After I spotted the snails, fried shrimp balls with sugar cane ($5.88) were put on the back burner, I ended up taking them to go.  Those shrimp balls got nothing on them snails.  They didn't taste that good when they were cold, they probably taste better when they were freshly made.  

The disc shaped sticky rice patty with lotus seed paste is the kind of mochi that I like to have for snack.  Not too sweet but sticky enough.  I should have got some to go.

Can't resist the sight of any pan fried dumplings, how can I?  Just look at their pan fried bottoms.  In this case, the bun was perfect but the filling needed to be bigger and more substantial with more meat.

This restaurant is shaped right, the circular floor plan goes well with la rotunda breadbasket of mine. I like the decor too, very Chinese in a traditional way.  (¬‿¬)

Encouraged by the dim sum success, I thought I would try their dinner.  I wasn't particularly inspired by the porridge with abalone ($9.99) which didn't have much flavor as I expected.  I had better ones at a friend's house with chucks of abalone pieces.  But this is how they make it in most Cantonese restaurants, you get the thinly sliced abalone pieces in the porridge.  Dried abalone is some kind of delicacy, but quality various.  Those were definitely not the best I've had.  And they don't put much in there.  If you read the knock-off version of Sun Tzu Art of War, and take the last strategy's number, minus 2 dozens, that's the number of abalone slices I got in the porridge.

When I was having dinner, I noticed they (the managers or the ppl by the register) just let the customers waiting by the door without acknowledging them and telling them how long the wait would be, that's rude.",4
481395,PLiyIC-Fj42Hu2AbmlO2mA,tI3J5jomrBs--n7r92186g,"Situated in the heart of the Gold Coast, Ping Pang Pong is a great, basic dim sum restaurant that is frequented by the large asian population that is situated around the Spring Mountain area of Las Vegas -- which obviously means they are doing something right! 

If you are expecting a noisy, traditional dim sum restaurant full of almost fights over dishes you are going to be disappointed. However, this lack of hostility does not take away from the food being fantastic. All of the servers are very friendly and eager to explain all of the dishes on their carts. Also the servers do speak English very well and also speak at least one dialect of Chinese. 

I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who is curious to learn more about Chinese culture, cuisine, and the world of dim sum.",4
481396,oMI0jC3XMhlhEXl7e9vwXQ,tI3J5jomrBs--n7r92186g,"The name almost sounds like the punchline for a bad joke you wouldn't dare tell at a Chinese restaurant. Except Ping Pang Pong is not that, nor is it the name of the Azn triplets in your cringeworthy joke.

At Ping Pang Pong, they take their dim sum quite seriously. At least I'm pretty sure their dim sum is among the best I've ever had. I love how they add these bits of salted shrimp to their taro cake for flavor. Yum.

It seems a bunch of the older casinos in Vegas have a 'hidden gem'; Ping Pang Pong is Gold Coast casino's. We went there for lunch & there was this mega queue of Azn ppl (as myself), a queue that stayed long, long after we were done eating lunch (we stayed to play a bit of Wheel of Fortune). I figured this meant that a continuous stream of people kept coming in - & that that's maybe because the food is good. The things I learn from watching Sherlock.

TIP: How do you skip the super long line at Ping Pang Pong? No, this isn't that non-PC joke

If you spot a big empty table that will seat you/your group & the people in front of/behind you, consider befriending them, at least temporarily, for the purpose of sharing the table. That's what we did. There were 3 of us, 2 of them, & a few empty seats separating us from them. Otherwise, we would've had to wait another 30 minutes to an hour.",5
481397,tehou-14ifiWivOzkztfCg,tI3J5jomrBs--n7r92186g,"I might come here just because it's fun to say ""Ping Pang Pong."" 

Other than that, the food is ehhhh alright and pretty expensive for dim sum. The char siu bao was fluffy, but that was really the only good thing we had. The chicken feet were more rubbery than I like, and the har gow wrappers were dry and too thick. I just went yesterday and I already can't remember what else we ordered, it was that forgettable. 

We were two people and were seated at the end of the route, so there was never anything left by the time they got to us. We kept watching as the large groups ahead of us kept taking the last of the items we wanted. We only got some items after the large group was finished eating and left. They should put more of the popular items in the cart so there are enough to go around the restaurant.",2
481398,c_h-ML3g4gDnnlaSLPwDhA,tI3J5jomrBs--n7r92186g,"I'm a fan of Dim Sum, and usually try to make it a point to try them when I come across one.  To this day, I have yet to find a place that blew my mind.  Din Tai Fung was probably the closest (is that even considered dim sum?), but in the more typical joints where they come around with the trays, I've never been super impressed.  We decided to try Ping Pang Pong since it was in a casino, and we figured it would provide the necessary cleanliness that I find to be generally lacking in dim sum spots.  

We got there 15 minutes before they opened on Sunday, and there was a line of 3-4 parties waiting in front  of us.  By the time they opened, there were another 5-6 parties behind us.  Shortly after we began dining, the place was full.  Good sign.  The wait staff was surprisingly Chinese - I say that because this is inside the Gold Coast and I would have thought the wait staff would be more diverse - and resulted in a service very typical to other dim sum restaurants.  They spoke little English, and often called out the dish in Chinese even after realizing we were not Chinese.  The décor was clean and typically nice for a casino restaurant, so this part we enjoyed quite a bit - dim sum in a clean environment.

The food was actually quite good.  It was quite distinctly lacking of the dumplings and shumai that we were looking for, they just kept telling us it would come later and they would come in trickles.  But what did eventually come - shrimp shumai and shrimp & pork shumai - were very good.  But alas, no har gow, no rice noodle rolls with shrimp (they had one with beef...), and just not enough choices of these little pieces.  What they did have though, were interesting and not common.  Congee porridge is common, and theirs is good.  They have a large bowl for the table and a smaller bowl for one.  They had cooked congee in spice broth which were excellent, and clams in similar sauce that were great also.  Their souffle-type dessert (they only make 10 per day) was delicious, as well as the custard flavor rolls.

One big issue I had with them were that the dessert dishes started coming out first, and just kept coming around.  Why do they do that?  Bring out the porridge and dumplings first!  We kept having to tell them ""later, after we eat!"" as the dessert trays passed by probably at least half dozen times.  They've got to fix this.

But all-in-all a good meal, and our meal for 4 came to $49 plus tips.  That's not a bad deal, and perhaps I can overlook some of their glaring shortcomings.  3.5 stars is more appropriate, but I'll bump up a half based on the quality of what we actually did get to eat.

Table-for-1 Factor:  May be for regular lunch & dinner, but for the dim sum brunch it's probably not a great option.",4

My biggest complaint? Because we arrived so early, they seemed to only have desserts ready & those kept coming around quite readily in the beginning. They didn't seem to start bringing out the savory dishes til about 15-20 minutes after they opened.
My recommendations? If you arrive early, be patient & wait about 20 minutes til the dishes really start coming out. If not, then show up about 30 minutes after they open, just be prepared to wait.

Kung Pao Chicken - I enjoyed how tender the chicken slices were, and the sauce for this particular dish was just right, right amount of spicy and right amount of sweetness to it. 

Gobo Beef - probably my new favorite dish to order when coming to this restaurant. Small thick cut cubes of beef sirloin, every flavorful and savory taste of beef cubes. could be more on the tender side, but otherwise very tasty.

Beef Chow Fun - average tasting chow fun, a little on the oily side for my liking, but chow fun is my all time favorite chinese food dish, so I normally will order this entree at any chinese restaurant i'm eating at. 

BBQ Pork fried rice - it was a little on the dry side for me, but I guess it's better to be dry than oily. nothing unique or special, pretty standard dish for fried rice

Salt and Pepper pork - a little too much on the salty side

seafood Mixed soft noodles - this name of the entree to me is in no doubt that it's their fancy name for lo mein, very standard display and style of cooking for the seafood lo mein look-alike, 

their hot tea was very very good, but their service overall sucked and some people (the hostess) really have terrible and rude attitudes and I know the customer can sense and see it. slow service, and just overall even if they are understaffed, they dont have to be sour faced or rude about it.

Dumpling and bun exterior a little hard and didn't taste fresh. Listen, bottom line is in Vegas there are a lot better places to spend your money than Ping.",2
481428,NMJTU79WGaOD5xlg_onCDQ,tI3J5jomrBs--n7r92186g,"There's a line to get into the restaurant. All guests in your party must be present before your party may be seated. It's important to let the hostess know how many people there is in your party. For drinks, they provide complimentary tap water. However, there's a flat fee per person for a pot of Chinese Restaurant Tea. The dim sum was delicious. However, I didn't like how the windows on the dim sum cart weren't very visible. I felt that the dim sum could have been more presentable!

We got the following:

1. A bowl of steamed rice topped with chinese mushroom, diced chicken in bone, and ginger. It was served in a tall wooden bamboo looking container. It came with soy sauce on the side. I felt that the rice was a bit bland. I didn't like how the chicken had small little bones.

2. Eggplant topped with shrimp in black bean sauce. It came in 3. It was tasty but on the oily side.

3. Pan Fried Sticky Rice Cake filled with Red Bean Paste on a round banana leaf. It came in 3. It was crispy on the top, sweet and savory.

4. Steamed Beancurd Wrapped Tofu Ball topped with English Peas, Corn, and Chinese Mushroom.

5. Steamed Crystal Shrimp Dumpling. It came in 4. I liked how there were big pieces of shrimp and no fillers in the dumpling.

6. Steamed Fish Paste Ball, which came in 3, consisted of fish paste, coriander, diced Chinese sausage, topped with a gojiberry, and over a bed of enoki mushroom.

7. Steamed Roast Pork Buns, which came in 3 and were fresh from the oven.

8. Chinese style Crepe filled with crispy dough and shrimp and topped with soy sauce and scallion.

9. Steamed Beef Ball, which came in 3, consisted of beef and parsley, served over a bed of beancurd, and drizzled with A1 sauce.

10. Steamed Sticky Rice with sausage, scallion, egg, and dried shrimp. I was surprised there wasn't any Chinese mushroom.

11. Egg Custard Tart. I liked how the crust was slightly burnt!",4

We asked,""where is our salads when nobody is sitting there, we ordered 20 minutes ago."" They responded, they get their salad first since they ordered over the phone.

Like Robert B. mentioned, I walked in here at noon on a Tuesday and it was DEAD! Seriously?!  I think the lunch crowd knows that this place isn't the place to go for a quick in-and-out lunch.

we got there around 9ish for drinks and a late dinner as we were still up in the air as far as our plans for the evening. i was initially surprised that this place wasn't as packed as most thai food spots (or restaurants in Las Vegas in general). i couldn't quite place why, since the drinks were pretty good, the venue had a lot of space both at the bar and in the dining portion of the restaurant, and we were able to order and get our food/drinks relatively quickly.

Satay is a pretty trendy spot, it seems that it'd be a fun place to enjoy the night close to the Strip if you want to drink and eat on the cheap. intimate lighting, lots of bar space, cool decor, and their food is tasty and authentic, not some type of Americanized version of thai food!

Now I'm not sure what she got me but I do remember eating a great Thai veggie soup and coconut rice along with some fat noodle dish.  All was delish!

That Singha sure did taste good.  Complementing that was the combo beef and chicken satay, with peanut sauce and mildly vinegar'd cucumbers.  This plate does not come with lontong, rice will have to be ordered separately.  The Vegetable plate was a definite pleasant surprise, refreshing, crispy tasty for outdoor munchies.  

We were forced to sit outside because the restaurant was booked for a company private party, huge NAB convention tend to do that around town.  It was a happy misfortune on our part.  It is spacious and perfect for out of control loud discussions amongst good friends.

I ordered the Singapore noodles, because I'm also craving curry to go with my beer.  The blended seasoning of tumeric, curry and other spices and herbs successfully imbued that trademark smell and taste upon the noodles.  Super yummy for a super afternoon.

My GF, ordered the Chicken Satay, which she says is a terrific flavorful and deliciously tender nuggets on the skewer.  She says it was so good there is no need to dip it in the sauce.  My geektastic friend, who is trying Thai for the very first time, also ordered the Singapore Noodle.  Let's just say the look on his face is a mixture of uncertainty, fear, and curiosity.  He says it's good.  It is quite a departure from his usual fare.

The previous night, we visited the Japanese Restaurant, Musashi.  It was either this one or Musashi that evening.  Also of interest in the same strip mall is the Morrocan restaurant . . . .that's for next time.",4

They have thai and Malaysian dishes. We got the pad see ew which was good with the right amount of sauce and oiliness. The beef rendang was tender and flavorful.

My friend and I stopped in for dinner a little later than  the normal dinner rush hours and to our delight the place was relatively quiet and had quite a few open tables.  The host said we would be seated in just a few minutes but it took at least 10. I didn't really understand why because there were plenty of available tables and we were the only ones waiting.  They seemed to be a little understaffed so that may have had something to do with it.  Regardless we were finally seated. 

The experience continued to go downhill as the server took forever to take our drink order and forever to bring our drinks.  And yes,  also forever to take our food order and bring our food. 

Normally this would automatically mean a 2 or 3 star review from me,  as service really makes an experience,  but their food is so delicious I'm letting it slide.  We had strawberry lemonade,  which isn't lemonade at all in the sense of having lemons or lemon flavor in it. It was that they used strawberries as the ingredient instead of lemons and made a drink from that.  It was delicious and came with a big straw to get the chunks of fresh strawberry out. 

As far as food,  i had the glass noodle stir fry with chicken and my friend had the Thai fried rice with beef. Both dishes were seriously A+,  some of the best Thai I've ever had.  Really huge portions and a superb price point,  especially for Vegas.

I've been here more times than I can count and I have only had good service once and that was because the owner herself was taking care of me due to some party. 
Today I went and misjudged my party's size instead of being a three top we became a six top. The girl rolled her eyes and looked pissed that I needed a bigger table. If it was slammed I could understand but we were the only table in the restaurant.
It took the two servers over ten minutes to get me a water, my friends had to ask for their drinks three times. On the third time they actually went to the bar and asked for the beers. The shocker in all this we were the only table. Being in the industry myself I could understand beers/waters taking awhile but being the only freaking table in the whole restaurant it's just ridiculous. I'm about at my limit with this restaurant but I'm addicted to their Pad Thai and Panang Curry.

The chicken pad thai that I ordered was exceptional.  Most importantly, there doesn't seem to be much of a lunch rush here, which makes for a very quick and easy lunch break.

They took it back and brought me a new one.  A new person brought it out to me.  Said it was a new one but they pre-make it so of course it was just as spicy.  I wish they would have cared to tell me that before I had placed the order, burned my mouth off, and wasted my money.  The servers were nice tho.",2

My beef came out raw which I don't mind but there was no taste to it. I need a little flavor in my life personally. Other than that everything else was great.

If you like really spicy foods I would get higher but I would probably beware a 10! My waiter was awesome and was very quick and respectful, but the other guy in the restaurant was being a little sarcastic with the other patrons.

Chicken Satay - probably the only thing that tasted good. Really thin piece of chicken and the cucumber salad that came with it was drenched in some sort of syrup so it was super sweet. 

Calamari - needs to be fried more so it's actually crunchy and more salt added. Most of the pieces we ate had no taste to it.

Chicken Wing - was okay but it was fried and drenched in more sweet thick syrup.

Thai Tea - beyond sweet. I literally could've poured my cup into 2 different cups, add more water and wala, got myself 2 Thai tea drinks. That's how sweet it is.

Tom Kha - nasty stuff. Not fresh and overcooked.

Pad Thai - wet, not dry and sweet. 

Beef Fried Rice - was okay, not the best flavor. 

Beef Pad Se Eew - looked so burnt up. It was so spicy to the point you can't enjoy the food.

All in all, everything was too sweet. Spice level is not the same. A few of us order with a level 6, some where super spicy and the others didn't taste spicy at all. 

Service sucked. It was great before we got our food, always refilling our water and what not. Then once the food comes, not even once they came to refill our water or asked if everything was fine. The sad part was that they weren't even busy!

On to the food. The Thai beef jerky is delicious. One of my favorite things ever. My boyfriend loves the duck appetizer. The roti canai is delicious if you like curry. I always have the nasi goreng because it is just perfect. Their level 4 spicy level is perfect for me but I love spicy food.

It's a great place to go if you are tired of the Strip prices and Strip mediocre quality or just living locally and want a quick quality Asian meal.  We were staying off the strip doing some business and Yelpers helped us find this place when we were very hungry, it was getting late, and we were on the way back to the hotel.  

I had Chicken with Vegetables and Brown Rice.  It was all good and I could return for the same.  The chicken tasted fresh, no aftertaste, like we have encountered in other Thai places.

Service was ""matter of fact"" and efficient.

Atmosphere is casual--not really a romantic dating environment--more for friends get together, established couples, or family or dining alone. 

Prices are reasonable for the area.

Parking is free and easy.

We would return again next time in the area.",4

Pad thai, beef pad see ew, tom yum goong, coconut rice, chicken PANANG CuRRY (to die for), mama's chicken curry, beef rendang and steamed vegetables.

The service upon arrival was great! Our hostess was very friendly and say us right away.
Our server was so adorable! We asked her if they had any beers on draft and she brought us out a bottles Guiness that said ""draught"" on the label! LOL That was the absolute best!!
My bf ordered the Mongolian beef and coconut rice. The Mongolian beef was amazing. The beef was perfectly seasoned and the sauce and grilled onions added so much great flavor!
I had the tom yum soup spice level 7! It was so delicious! It was my first time having tom yum and I am so obsessed!! I wish there was a location here!!!! I also ordered the spicy beef salad and that was very tasty as well!!
I'm really glad we found this place! We will definitely return next time we're in town!!!",5

I came here to get Thai tea, which was priced at $3.50 plus tax. The guy gives me a small cup (for the price, especially when I can get a huge cup for the same price in LA) and hands me back $16 instead of the $16 plus change that I should have received. I go back in and ask him about my change. He fiddles around and tells me he owes me 10 cents because he doesn't have it. 

This is bad business. Do I care about the 10 cents? Of course not. But if you don't have the change don't shortchange me first, then when you get called out about it still shortchange me. What he should have done was given me too much money rather than cheat a customer. He could have said sorry I don't have the change first. I don't care how good your food is or how good the tea was, I won't be returning. Who knows how many customers they do this to.",1

They don't have any kind of curry or pad-thai that they are able/willing to prepare vegan. The vegan options were just really boring sounding vegetable dishes. I went with the best sounding option they had which was the Rad Na, large flat noodles with vegetables. It didn't seem like it was going to be very exciting and it really wasn't. It didn't have any special flavor; however, it was very salty. I didn't even finish it, which is rare, because I'm a big eater who generally finishes things, especially when it's Thai food. They do have vegan dessert- sorbet, so that's a plus, not that it was amazing. All in all, this place is really mediocre for vegans.",2

My husband loves the Pad Thai. (It's a bit sweet for me- I just double up on the lime).  I had the Tum Yum with chicken- level 8. Lots of chicken and mushrooms-  so flavorful and the spice level was spot on. Got me a bit flushed.  Spicy Basil with coconut rice was good as well. Requested to add onions which was no problem- a bit crunchy on the veggies. Better than mushy veggies though. 

My dislike- crab rangoon appetizer.  Tastes like hot cream cheese, no crab flavor.

Searched Yelp, and found this place.  It is now one of my favorite places to eat in Vegas.  

The food is always fresh, the staff is very friendly, and the food comes out pretty quickly even when the place is standing room only.  The prices are extremely reasonable and the atmosphere is casual.  Hint:  bumped up my normal level 7 order to number 8, and there was a noticeable difference.

Nasi Goreng- Indonesian/ Malaysian fried rice with shrimp, squid, topped with a sunnyside fried egg... tasted even better the next day

Pad See Ew - Chicken and Shrimp flat rice noodles Thai style with eggs and Chinese broccoli in black soy sauce... better than average

Thai Duck Curry - Red curry with coconut milk, bell peppers,  basil leaves, cherry tomatoes,  pineapple and bamboo shoots.... on top of coconut broken rice helped put it on the top of the chart.

This Thai restaurant is a well publicized and received by the Las Vegas locals. Very close to McCarran International and as midtown as you can get. Plenty of parking and a perfect spot to rendezvous with a local friend from Summerlin.

Our server Tia was most polite and professional allowing us to socialize with our friend. Don't recall ever asking; yet it was on our table. The three entrees were served hot and simultaneously. Ate slowly without interruption which was very much appreciated by all of us. Spoiled by previous Cambodian cuisine, we were hoping for a better selection.

But even I love Satay.  They have a huge menu which has something for everyone.  I usually get the chicken fried rice - they always allow me to customize my order to my liking and do not make me feel badly about it like a lot of other restaurants I've been to.

They also have a great happy hour - M-F 3:00-7:00 (I think) - which has several appetizers for $3-$5 and really cheap drink prices.  Their martinis are delicious and you HAVE to try their garlic basil fries.  They are the best fries in Vegas.  The prices in general are low, which is surprising since they are right off of the Strip.  My husband and I never spend more than $40-$50 including apps, alcohol & entree.

The staff is always super sweet and they seem to really appreciate their regulars.  They always recognize us when we come in & welcome us back.  They get good business but we've never had to wait for a table.  They also have a loyalty card - don't forget to sign up!  Satay is definitely our favorite spot in Vegas!",5

Great cuts of dark meat and nice seasonings/sauce. Very flavorful and worth it. Not expensive and easy to park. Huge place that has plenty of seating.

No one came to check on usour anytHing. There were seven of us and they brought us four waters. Honestly I've had better dim sum with more variety too.

I still remember the visit here vividly as it was the worst experience i have ever had at any restaurant in my entire life!
I remember how dirty the place felt with the tacky decor, should have been a sign to run. Second issue the host had attitude to seat us in a booth with two children said no children allowed in booth. Didn't wanna hassle finding another place though because kids were hungry.
We ordered walnut shrimp, Mongolian beef, salt n pepper pork chop and fried rice.
About thirty minutes later I ask a guy where our food was. He said what food!? So I say never mind we are leaving. The original lady who took our order saw we were trying to leave started shouting ""why u leave no pay, food coming u need to wait"" [sic] 5 min later they proceeded to bring out food, they brought out fried shrimp, soup and Chinese broccoli. I said we didn't order this. She argued yes you did. By now I'm so livid I didn't wanna make a scene so I asked my husband to deal with them before I explode. So I go to the car. 20 minutes later he is walking to the car with the food we didn't order and I guess our order then I see the lady chasing him and saying no tip for me not even one dollar!! OMG are you serious?????!!!!!! She had the audacity to literary follow him outside and say this in the parking lot! Of course no tip, not after the absolute worst service ever !! That I thought was the worst part. My husband gets in the car to tell me the check was $83 meaning they charged us for the food we did not order!!!!!!!!!!!! He said the host who takes the checks wouldn't budge and said how does he know its not our fault and we keeping the food anyways even though we said we didn't want it he said ok we still made food if u keep or throw away u still have to pay!

Late night dim sum menu is about 15 items, we sampled quite a few.
Steamed pork buns were solid, pork shumai were tasty, shrimp balls were fresh, beef tripe was not my bag, and the noodle in the spare rib rolled noodle dish had an odd flowery aftertaste. 

Overall, flavors were solid and pricing was fair. Service was nonexistent despite 4 employees walking around.

Everything was so delish. The one day sun came with the best sauce! 

I will definitely be eating there again!",5
528396,NNFDK7KbNjDtO7nUEDMUcQ,ozfvymkBqw8j0Oa_tC5mpA,One of the best thai places in Vegas. I always feel welcomed in the restaurant. Has great lunch and dinmer specials. The dinner special says it feed 2 but four of us ate it with leftovers. It also has the best green tea ice cream I've ever eaten.,5
528397,Gymq9BBnmQiMkcI7v1nopQ,ozfvymkBqw8j0Oa_tC5mpA,"I was not at all impressed, and certainly wouldn't recommend. 

The restaurant was completely empty aside from one other table that already had their food. The waitress was inattentive and the food took much longer than it should. 

The soup was extremely salty, and all of the entrees were over sauced and flavorless.

If you have been following me, I have been reviewing more Northwest area restaurant due to the fact that I live near Summerlin. This restaurant I spotted one day driving in the area and found out they deliver. So I got Appetizer - Gyoza , Pad Thai, and Green Tea Ice Cream. Gyoza was amazing -- very fresh had a spicy sauce with it witch was good but killed the dumpling meat taste. Pad thai -- it was average unfortunately no peanuts or crushed on it or little, and noodles where good. The Green tea ice cream to me tasted more like vanilla ice cream with a green color but it was good I have seen some where its intensely green tea flavored. I have no major complaints, The Gyoza where probably some the best I have had. Will be back to try other items.",3
528399,H4voNUp1UQevsrkIClfjsw,ozfvymkBqw8j0Oa_tC5mpA,"Placed order with Eat24. Took nearly 45 minutes to get my order- got the impression that they didn't even start cooking it until I showed up. Food quality is very mixed- tasty dishes with low-quality ingredients rendering the dishes themselves poor.

THAI CHICKEN WINGS appetizer- tasty six-piece order of wings with extra sauce, delicious aroma was a bit better than the actual taste. 

KANA MHOO KROP (roasted pork stir fried with Chinese broccoli in garlic and oyster sauce)- portion is half the size of other entrée ordered, and pork used in this dish is either super dry/old or fatty. Could not eat the protein in this dish. If I wanted just Chinese broccoli, I would have ordered that. I didn't pay $10 for this dish to consist of pork jerky and broccoli. I will say that the sauce was tasty though.

PAD SEE EW- ordered this medium heat with beef and it was a huge step up from mild and the protein was also tough in this dish. Overall it wasn't bad though. 

TOM KHA- soup was delicious! Pleasant surprise. Good size portion, good complexity of flavor, plentiful tomato and mushrooms. Unfortunately, also plentiful chunks of ginger, comparable in size to the pieces of chicken. Tasty though!

Service was polite but very slow. Placed order, waited 15 minutes to leave, arrived around 25 minutes after placing order. Waited an additional half hour. No other patrons were present. 

Order also asked for an additional cup of oyster sauce on the side, but they were unable to do so, saying that they didn't have packets of this condiment. I asked if it could be put in a small plastic cup, they said they couldn't do that because they have the oyster sauce in a huge gallon-size container in the back, and they would have to open the container in order to get me some. I'm baffled as to how on earth they managed to get the sauce into my dish but are completely unable to put it in a cup.

Food quality was such that it seemed a great recipe was being used for these dishes- someone clearly knows their business with this cuisine. However, the cook is either limited to low-quality ingredients or simply does not care, because the actual execution is lackluster.",2

Not so much. They gave me orange chicken instead of lemon, which was not only the wrong thing but tasted like a bad version of Panda Express.

This may very well be our last time in Chinatown after a long absence from eating out in general. It used to be the cool place in Vegas to eat and shop at a good price. These days our experiences have been very negative. We've visited a few restaurants in this area and the same scenario plays out: non-American Asians and the few whites around are treated well; and everyone else F.U. 

What started out as a small enclave in the Westside where anyone could come as they were has now unofficially become ""Asian only"" in certain establishments. I guess the Asian tour buses in Chinatown Plaza take the place of other customers (local or not). This type of segregation reminds me of rural America and plays a big role in ruining the once vibrant spirit of Las Vegas. I was not raised to separate myself from others who are different than myself; and I find this new ambiance very jarring and disturbing. 

My advice is to observe the clientele and interactions to determine which places will be a right fit. It is not advisable to just ""walk in.""

On another note, their credit card receipt looks ambiguous because the lines for pre-tip amount and tip amount were almost the same. One needs to be careful and clear when filling out and signing their credit card info on the merchant's copy.",2

I've never had worse asain food. The orange chicken was cold, was processed chicken and tasted worse than McDonald's chicken nuggets. Please fire the cooks! How could you have a place like this that gets terrible reviews and not make a change in the food?? My table also had other dishes and nobody liked their food. Even my lemonade tasted like water! How do you mess up lemonade?? $100 later and not happy!",1
554537,P_4NaHd1elsh5BYDHyCJZQ,a1t31qMLd5fQocEjbSJ61A,Best way to describe this place is fast food Chinese. Food was not fresh and was previously prepared. Rice was dry.,2

Fried rice tasted stale, and the chicken tasted odd.",1
554539,KT8XNVvo5a42jUM--ZtJgw,a1t31qMLd5fQocEjbSJ61A,"I love this place.   Ok , the food is straight up average , BUT .. I like that the staff is Asian and they're honest with suggestions.  I've eaten here at least 10 times now.  It's been consistent over the years.   If you're looking for the best of the best , this isn't the place.  If however you're looking for decent consistent Asian noodles then this is a great place.  

My favorite is the chow fun and house special fried rice.   The Pho is VERY American so if you're looking to re-live that trip to Vietnam it's not gonna be for you.... But I still like it in a hurry.  Honestly it's probably only on the menu as a stop gap for traveler who only know Pho from some American back home spot. 

Bottom line ...
It's clean , fast , honest , and priced accordingly for where its at.  

It's my go to spot for quick lunch and light dinner when I'm at The Mandalay.  

Enjoy.",4

You can always tell when a place is good when it's busy with patrons and it was, especially full of Asian customers! ;) This time I came in with the intention of ordering the crispy duck noodle soup which was delish! I forgot to request flat rice noodles instead of egg noodles but it was great anyway as the duck was meaty and perfectly cooked. The soup was more than enough especially for lunch. We had a lady named lua (I think) service our table, she was very friendly and attentive, she was quite endearingly cute! A little pricy but the restaurant was clean and didn't look cheap at all, nicely decorated with plants, mirrors, artworks and soft colours used. The toilets are clean and spacious! Free wifi available too. Always a place to visit when I'm in town!!",5

I was looking for a moderately priced Asian restaurant on the south strip, and looking at the menu online beforehand, saw a lot of things that sounded good.  I should have known otherwise when we walked in and only 2 tables were occupied. Dining companion and I both ordered chicken dishes for the main course. She thought the chicken tasted rubbery, as did I. I usually associate this with undercooked meat. We both got very sick to the stomach about 2 hours later and these dishes were the likely culprit. We spent the remainder of our evening on the toilet back at the hotel room.

The only positives were that the server was attentive (because there were only like 7 customers at 6pm) and the Chicken Satay appetizer (which appeared to be cooked properly) was actually pretty good.

I assumed in typical Chinese restaurant style this meant it came with it so I said yes and was then charged $4.25 for it.

We also ordered the Cashew Chicken.  Our waitress came out about 5 minutes after we ordered and told us they were out of cashews, but they would make it without cashews.  Are you kidding me?  They ran out of cashews?

2. This place adds some variety. There's so many places that are just cafes/pizza places.

3. Their noodle soups are good. 

The beef brisket soup was good and so was their wonton soup! Just don't venture far from the Chinese noodle soups. (I saw someone getting a pad thai there and it looked pretty bad...

The Mandalay Bay could do much better, especially with a restaurant right off the casino floor and in a high traffic area.",1

The Orange peel chicken was soooo good - I am still thinking about it.  The flavor was delicious - and though it was fried, it was not battered so it was not greasy at all.  But the flavor - truly delicious.  

Hubby had the noodles with shrimp and xo sauce - which was very expensive for what it was - but still quite tasty.

Okay. It is a holiday. I am not going to complain. But after we sat down, it took so long for someone to serve us. That is ridiculous.

When it was time to order our food, our waiter was super rude, and started talking to another table, which was unnecessary (they had only been sitting 10 minutes...) Moreover, there were many items on the menu that they no longer offer (all thai curry, glass noodle salad). 
Right before the food came out, I took my daughter to the restroom and another customer, who watched me walk in with her began banging on the door and yelling at me. I was there three minutes.
Now the food. Papaya salad (without shrimp, still $9.99) was incredible 5/5. Vegetarian pho was edible but they used some crappy pre cut veggies and the veggie broth could use much more flavor 3/5. There was finally some inedible item that the waiter told my parents to get because they didn't have curry. It looked like diarrhea with about a cup worth of fat layering the top. The broth was some filthy thin meat and curry water and the 'chicken' was about 50% skin and 50% brown meat. Absolutely disgusting -10/5.
We let our waiter know but he did not care, so when we had to go to the counter to pay (after waiting several minutes), we told the cashier/woman in charge and she removed it from the bill.

We were in the mood for banh beo so I did my research and it appears that this was the only place nearby us that carried it.This place is tucked away in a little asian business center. When we arrived, there was ample parking (6pm on a Tuesday). There was no one there and the place was dead. Which doesn't bother me, it just means quicker service. 

We ordered:
Banh Beo - Not what I am used to in CA, but they tasted good. I wish they added mung bean and real shrimp, also the dough was a little dense than how I would prefer it, but I still really enjoyed them. They didn't come out with any fresh thai chilies so we asked for them. The chilies were perfectly spicy and really made the dish better. If you're Vietnamese, you should know that chilies and this dish go together like icing on the cake! 4/5

Banh Cuon Dac Biet - The presentation was great. The rice noodle rolls weren't spectacular, pretty plain - even the meat filled ones were boring. However, the pork patty (cha) tasted really good and I could tell that they were fresh and homemade. I also enjoyed the fried crispy mung bean fritters and the fried sweet potato fritter (banh tom chien). Overall we slurped the dish clean. It wasn't the best i've ever had, but it was still very good! 4/5

Goi Cuon Chao Tom - this is always a controversial dish to order. We are always comparing this one to the famous spring roll restaurant in Orange County (Brodard). This place is obviously not going to compare, but they are also not trying to be like them either. We both really enjoyed these spring rolls. 2 large rolls were cut in half making them 4 pieces, they had a nice big fat slice of shrimp patty, and the sauce tasted good. 4/5

We also wanted to try their Banh Mi, so we ordered it to-go for our lunch tomorrow. I requested that they put the pickled veggies (do chua) separate, so that they don't soggy up the sandwiches. The veggies could of been pickled a little bit more - the sandwiches could of used the sourness, however, the sandwiches were tasty. The bread was very fluffy, crispy and tasted fresh even out of the toaster the next day! 

Of the 2 sandwiches we ordered, by far the best one was the Banh Mi Dac Biet. The meat was homemade and moist, very tender, and flavorful. I would skip the Banh Mi Nem Nuong - the nem nuong meat patty was missing a lot and not flavorful. 

By the time we were done, there seemed to be a good amount of people coming in and eating. I also noticed they were all Vietnamese! Looks like I found my local spot for banh beo and banh mi dac biet cravings.",4
603376,H7SQGUR77cvni1WQqgIP9w,6qnB6AQSur85BLx6c11dOA,"Went here for lunch with coworkers because a coworker wanted to try out Pho.
So we got Pho and split a sandwhich.
The Pho was okay. When I got my bowl, the noddles were in a huge big clump ball. Took me awhile to break it apart. The broth wasn't as flavorsome as other Pho places I've been to. So i'll probably go to Pho somehwere else.
But the sandwhich we had.. Banh Uot Bi Thit Nuong #37 on the menu.
SOOO GOOD! I'll DEFINITELY come back for the sandwiches! The pork was so tender and the pickled vegetables had so much flavor. The bread was warm and crisp but yet fluffy. SO. GOOD! I recommend trying it out.
The service was friendly but they didn't check on us after we got our meals. They weren't attentive because my coworker tried calling them over but they wouldn't look over. There was barely anyone there also, so it made it frustrating we didn't get great service. 
All in all, not too bad!",3

I looked over and they were eating and the server looked right at me. Well I then got up and went and grabbed my own menu. Then about 3 more tables of people came in and they jumped right up and helped them right away. Finally after having to say I am ready to order the server came she took our order and we asked that our appetizer which was the banh beo to come out first she said okay and walked away....well still no water and about 20 mins later food came out all at once....Our banh beo was so bad it tasted sour and had a smell I told the server quietly about it and she said oh nice time tell me right away before you eat more....wth....I barely ate it and wanted her to know!!! Well last time I come back to this joint...you get better service if you are foreign...or out of towners.... cause they jump right on servicing them over locals.....",1

Curious about why this was the busiest restaurant in the strip mall we decided to eat here and ignore the smell. It took a ridiculously long time for our waitress to bring us water and take our order. 
We ordered the house special appetizer, one seafood soup and some fun chow noodle with pork. The appetizer came 40 minutes later when we were about to leave. It looked really good, but we had cancelled and send it back. I don't know if it really takes 40 minutes to make or if they were just making excuses for it being so late. If it does take 40 minutes to make then it shouldn't be an appetizer and it shouldn't be on the menu. The soup I had was good but I wish our waitresses asked me the type of noodles I wanted because I would have preferred the egg noodles. The chow fan noodles with pork  was really good. They have so many dishes to choose from it is a bit overwhelming. I would go back and give them another try. I think we just caught them on a super busy night. The waitstaff was friendly.",3

I came here with a large group, forgive me for only remembering a few of the things that occurred. For food, I ordered the seafood noodle soup. It wasn't bad, but wasn't great, just OK. A friend ordered the bun bo hue, which was disappointing because it came with one tiny tiny piece of pork blood. Another friend ordered a shrimp salad, which I must say was pretty good! With that said, this place seems to have a hit or miss selection of food. For drinks, I had the thai tea, which was also OK.  My friend ordered the matcha green tea, and informed the waitress that she was still waiting for it.  The waitress then informs her that they ran out of matcha. Not sure what that is about, but if they ran out of something, it should be their job to inform the customers rather than having the customers waiting and expecting it to arrive.",3

The Watermelon Juice was pretty good but they basically just blended the watermelon and added crushed ice. I prefer that the watermelon is blended with the ice for more a slush texture. With the way their serve it, half was warm and half was cold.

The Chao Tom Goi Cuon was pretty good. The Chao Tom was a huge chunk and was very flavorful in the spring roll. My only compliant is that the lettuce didn't taste so fresh in the spring roll.

Banh Canh Tom Cua was decent. The broth was on the thicker side and had a nice pork flavor to it. The shrimps weren't seasoned so they really didn't have a taste. Plenty of pork slices and gio heo in the soup. They didn't have any crab in the soup! What? Why is it called Banh Canh Tom Cua but didn't have any cua? Noodles were the normal banh canh noodles, nothing special. Overall, it was just okay. Not delicious but not terribly bad either.",3

I ordered the Hu Tieu noodle soup with assorted meat. My BF ordered the rice noodle plate with pork, fried yam, bean sprouts, cucumbers, and fish sauce. Overall, taste and quality were okay.

However, after dining there again, I was pleasantly surprised.  The wait staff this time was prompt and attentive.  This time around I had the Banh Mi Thit Nuong (pork sandwich) and it was pretty good!  The bread was fresh and crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.  My mom also had the pork chop there and it was decent as well.  The boba there was just meh, also the decor there was a bit odd too (aquarium style?).  Overall though I was happy with my recent visit to Hue Thai.",3
603388,m5-9R7p-QyTJkp89SniSZw,6qnB6AQSur85BLx6c11dOA,They have the best bread compare to lee's sandwiches  and Mr sandwiches. But the only problem they don't really put out a lot of meat inside the bread. There more focus on the veggies.,4

Their egg rolls and springrolls are priced the same as Nem Nuong Bistro and people complain about the rolls being overpriced over there, so we headed over here, to only find the prices comparable. 

This large restaurant has a vast selection of boba, sandwiches and the usual Vietnamese fare. Lots of seating, lots of menu options, but quality of ingredients and prep could be better.",3

The lamb is really goat meat. But the one saving grace of the place is the banh mi (sandwiches). Get the grilled pork sandwich, so much better than Lee's.",2
603393,Tz9Ssqb92M4RTWPScG3W9g,6qnB6AQSur85BLx6c11dOA,"I've eaten at this place for years.  I think their food is getting better.  Maybe they hired a new cook.   Service has always been a little weird at most Vietnamese restaurants from my experience.  This one is about the same.  There is usually no thought to what comes out first.  They frequently send out the appetizer ten minutes after the entrees or sandwiches.   It's almost like you as the customer need to tell them how you want your food or just order the appetizers then when you are ready order the entrees.  Also sometimes one person's food comes out way before the other people in your party.   The other thing is the check.  You almost always need to ask for it.  This seems to be another Vietnamese thing because nine times out of ten I always have to ask for the check at one of these places.  This may be normal in Vietnam, but in America where we have limited lunch time it is not cool to wait 15 minutes for a check.  If the food wasn't so darn good I might bother me more.  Still the food comes out really, really quickly.  I've never waited more than 10 minutes for food ever and I have been here at least 15 times.

The sandwiches are awesome.  The bread is always fresh.  The fillings are tasty.  I especially like the grilled pork sandwich.  I've tried the others, but this is the best.  Noodle bowls both Bun and Pho are average compared to other Vietnamese places, but they are passable.  The main reason to go there though is the sandwiches.  Their appetizers like Eggrolls have gotten way better with better quality lettuce, basil, and mint to wrap them with.  Boba drinks are Ok, but not the best.

Comparing to Lee's Sandwiches down the street - I prefer Hue Thai.  Their bread is better.  The fillings are better.  Lee's makes better drinks and deserts.  Hui Thai makes much better hot food.

I give this place an 8/10 for food.  7/10 for service.",4
603394,mQi63TGrungaU2Ni4ssBPQ,6qnB6AQSur85BLx6c11dOA,"My bfs cousin introduced us to this place and recommended the Vietnamese dessert drinks aka che which she was right. It was a yummy calm sweet but I also order the Vietnamese sandwich aka banh mi and I've had better. 

My bfs order the jasmine tea and we both appreciated the flavors. His cousin ordered the passionate dessert drink and I want more and would rate it a four star alone. But I was attracted to their banh mi sandwich sign and wanted to give it a try. 

I'll give them kudos for the creativity on their unique bread. I have not had this yellow crumbtious bread anywhere before but it would have been better it if was made fresh daily. You can taste its at least a day old. My bf was not satisfied since he ask for extra jalapenos and did not receive them as also I did ask for more liverhusrt spread and did not taste it. His cousin complain they only put one cilantro stem in his banh mi and filled his large ice coffee with majority of ice then coffee. 

I would come here for the che desserts but not for the banh mi unless the bread is made fresh daily. Would have rated it a 4star but 3 of out 5 of us complain so I gaved it a 3 star.",3

Went there tonight and  while the website is the same, there is a sign on the door under new management with a new name of AAA. This was the first time I had General Tso's chicken with chunks of pineapple and onions in it. Not sure what it was but it was definately not General Tso's. Also they no longer give white rice with entrees if you get a family combo. Pretty cheap if you ask me and it was enough to piss me off never to go back again. I called them and told them they forgot our white rice, they told me they no longer offer it. How can you be using the same web site as the old restaurant but not honor what is on it? Menu clearly says white rice and fried included. Also, cream cheese wonton'sare much smaller and tasted stale. Huge dissapointment and we won't be returning.

We always saw it as we would walk to and from the Albertson's from our house and we wanted to eat some Chinese food.  Small place. The huge menu posted on the front of the establishment is nice.  Our first time walking to this place, we took our puppy so she could get some exercise, so the menu out in front was a good perk.  Their portions size was very generous. My fiance got the tofu with eggplant in garlic sauce.  Delicious! A bit spicy but not overwhelming.  I got the sweet and sour shrimp.  Again, portion was great.  I loved that they put the sweet and sour sauce on the side. I tend to eat in small portions, but all the time, which, if the sauce was already mixed in, the shrimp would have been super soggy.  This allows me to put how much sauce I want in and keep my food longer without worry of the soggy factor.  Another plus was that they have Honey Walnut Shrimp.  Yes, you can get this at many Chinese food establishments, but seeing as how I hate driving in Las Vegas and this dish tends to be pricey, I'm glad to find a place close-by that sells it for a decent price (less than $15).

I'm still not really sure why there was a need to order ahead of time, if they were just going to dish it up upon our arrival. None of the people in line were too upset, which was a surprise. Had the shoe been on the other foot, I may have been a little upset. We were offered complimentary sodas while we waited on one last item to be prepared.

I came for take out so I placed my order and they said 10 minutes for soup, chicken lo mein, and general tso's chicken. Yea this is all for me to last throughout the day. To me Chinese take out is sick comfort food and I feel like death so its time to try a new place.

I understand going into a place to order take out May found silly, but if their website worked I would have saved the trouble, ordered ahead, and probably waited 20 minutes to come in.

After waiting 25 minutes I received my food. It was ok, but I will never get take out from here again. Flagging down someone to order was painful. 

Another reason why I won't order from here again is because I had to order each item separately to get it. When you order the Lunch Special that comes with soup and a soda, to go you don't get the soup or drink. That's half the meal! Why am I paying the same amount and not getting everything? Just plain stupid.",1

It's right across from Costco so we can eat before we shop!!  The crab Rangoon is made from real crab, not imitation.  Lettuce wraps are wonderful and large enough to share.",5
628633,lvaKbFelXk4FqkOfNjUxDw,DvFOetqoZonh-7G6spAugw,"There's been a few noticeable changes here since my last visit to Pei Wei. First, they replaced the long menu board near the entrance to a smaller and easier to read electronic menu screen. Some menu items such as the combos have been removed and some new items have been added, mostly appetizers and salads. Simply choose your protein (chicken, steak, shrimp, or tofu), size (small or large entree),  then your sauce, and then type of rice or noodle (white, brown, fried, etc). I don't come here much and I always forget what I got last time, so I just choose what sounds good. I've had all different entrees here and seem to usually go with Pei Wei spicy, orange peel, sesame or spicy Korean. This time around I decided to try sweet and sour chicken with a cup of Thai wonton soup. The wonton soup is nice and light, and the sweet and sour chicken was good but they tend to oversauce their entrees so if you're sensitive to that, be sure to tell them when ordering. The small entree size was perfect and I typically have a hard time finishing a large size, but it's only 2 bucks more.

They also removed the old skool soda fountain and installed a Coca Cola Freestyle machine on one side of the self service counter and a water/ice machine on the other side. The seating is all the same and if you're dining in, you simply grab your seat after grabbing your drinks and they'll bring your order out to you when it's ready, which isn't very long and they'll pick up your empty plates when you're done. Silverware, boxes, drinks, sauces and fortune cookies are all self service here.

I would recommend this place when you're looking for a fast casual Asian fusion meal. The food here is better than places like Panda Express and a lot fresher but the menu items are fairly similar.",4
628634,RCqze-l7-XMRF-A_qRk8RQ,DvFOetqoZonh-7G6spAugw,"Consistently good Chinese with a fair price and fast service.

On top of that they are constantly offering coupons and promotions through social media and email.  I can't even remember the last time I paid full price.  Last week I even received coupons through snail mail.  I usually call in my order to avoid the wait.  I'm a fan of the honey seared chicken and the spring rolls.",4

Oh, you ordered them spicy, so those are the *NEW* Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps.

Don't try to guess what I want, and give me an entirely different dish.  Also, I'm pretty sure if you are referring to a dish as new, it means the menu has changed.",1
628637,-HAOA6u3sC9z9mm2hPstgQ,DvFOetqoZonh-7G6spAugw,"Let's see... Where to start... This place has been around forever. I remember working at an ice cream joint next door (now L&L Hawaiian BBQ) when this place opened. It used to be our go to place during our lunch break. This place is located across Red Rock Casino at the Pavilion center plaza... 

I'll be honest, I'm probably going to be a little biased on this review since this is one of my favorite places to go grub when I'm around the Summerlin area. My friends, family and myself have been eating at this restaurant since 2004 when it opened. 10 years and I'm just now writing a review... Haha. 

Considering I've been a regular at this joint,  most of the employees know me and they usually have an idea what I'm going to get. This makes it a biased review simply because my experience is going to be different than someone who checked in for the first time... 

Just so you know, if you walk in this restaurant expecting authentic Asian food, you're going to be disappointed. This is more like an ""Americanized"" version and a little more casual than PF Chang, which by the way is a sister company. 

One of my all time favorite is the chicken Phad Thai. For the price you pay, you get a very decent portion. Sometimes I even have left overs. It's a little spicy but you can tell them how spicy you want it if you're not into hot stuff. Everything is fresh and made to order. You can actually see the cooks prepare your food behind the bar type counter and decor. Some of the other house favorites is also something I would recommend. The  ""Pei Wei Spicy"", ""Honey Seared "" and "" Caramel Chicken"" are all savory dishes. Some of my friends enjoy the ""Mongolian"" but I personally find it too salty for my taste. Mind you, all the dishes are customized to your liking. You get to pick what protein and what type of rice or noodles you want. 

With all that said, Pei Wei is a very simple conceptual restaurant. It's very casual. I don't consider myself a food connoisseur... As long as I enjoy the experience and the food suits my taste, I'm all for it.",4

The hostess sat us quickly, but warned us that the wait time for food would be a while (20 minutes or so). That was fine considering how we didn't wait for a seat. 

I ordered a Hong Kong Won Ton. The meal was okay, kind of reminded me of a won ton min but with that kind of noodles you find in Chinese dishes. I liked the broth, but not the best. 

I didn't appreciate the customer service. We ordered a Pad Thai for my dad, and requested it to not be spicy. I think I told our waitress at least 4 times asking for it mild. Later when my dad's dish came out, the waitress apologized for the long wait because they accidentally gave hours plate away to someone else. We then noticed the dish was really red. We asked again if this was considered mild, and two different waitresses briefly glanced and said yes. My dad tried it and it was very hot!

I ordered the pad Thai, which was so bad I couldn't eat more than two bites...and it is extremely rare for me to turn away food! My boyfriend tried it as well and wouldn't even go back for a second bite...he compared the noodles and sauce to spaghetti o's...!!  His house chow main was good, but cold. I would have ordered something else to replace my pad Thai, but the server never came back to check on us. Eventually we had to ask for the check, though the server did offer to remove the pad Thai charge before we needed to ask. Once the check came, it had an extra appetizer charge, which then took a long time to get someone's attention to remove it.

Once our orders were taken he put his phone in his pocket and grabbed a bowl, I immediately inquired if he was going to wash his hands. The cashier relayed the message to him and from that point on eyes rolled pots were slammed and the food was undercooked. #UNACCEPTABLE",1
668074,2tpdFYZ9Rdj0ZLpQjBVgMQ,vrf1r48AlfLdgm-x7C1aMw,"We were craving Chinese food and looked up places in Chinatown but most closed at 10pm or earlier so we were out of luck on a sit down place. We were looking for something like the Great Wall: old, dark lighting, booth seating, authentic, with great hot tea. We didn't see anything that fit the bill so we decided to eat in, because there's nothing I dislike more than eating at the newer Chinese restaurants with a tiny storefront and a couple of wooden tables to sit and eat. Since China GoGo is closest to us, and we've had their food before, we knew it would satisfy our food craving. In the past, delivery sometimes gets a bit mixed up, so we chose to pick up. 


1. Ordered food around 9pm on Friday night, they said it would be ready for pick up in 10 minutes! Talk about quick service! Very impressed with that.

2. Arrived and the order was perfect, everything was packed. I appreciate their attention to detail. 5 stars for service, ease, attention to detail, & convenience 

2. Ordered Family Dinner B and Combo noodles, chow mein, I think. 

The fatter noodles, chow mein combo, it was greasier than I liked, but the chicken and shrimp were tender. It needed extra soy sauce, the flavor could definitely be amped up in their noodles, so that was a minus. I'd say 2.5 stars for the noodles. Not awful, not great.

I got the Shrimp with Snow Peas, my fave, the shrimp were tender, portion was huge and for fast food style Chinese, I was very happy. The dish had more flavor than the noodles. Came with white rice and the rice was done right. Overall, a 4 star for what it is.

Boyfriend got the Beef Hunan,,crispy spicy beef. He usually gets Mo Gillian Beef but doesn't like their version. Loves PF Chang's with green beans instead of onions. YUM! But not from China GoGo, so he tried something new to us both. I tasted it and was surprised, reminded me of a sweet/spicy friend boneless  chicken I've had before from somewhere, but can't remember where. It was flavorful;  too spicy though, if you really want spicy this isn't for you. The one problem is the cornstarch breaking had a weird mouthfeel. Don't know what that was about kind of chalky. I would give the dish a 3.5 stars for Hunan Beef. Again, the rice was good.

Corn egg flower Soup was included. It was bland, not as good as I've had before. 2.5 stars for the soup. 

Family Dinner B Came with fried shrimp, eggrolls and crab Rangoon. We didn't get enough of the sweet dipping sauce, minus points. I had a nite of each, enjoyed the egg roll, the fried shrimp were crisp but greasy, the Rangoon were yummy. Overall score for these were 3.5, because we needed more sauce and the grease factor. 

4) I give them 3.5 stars overall, better than a 3 for the service and convenience. They lost points for some blandness, sparse serving of dipping sauce  & too much grease of some dishes. However, the food seems fresh, the value is great. You get a LOT of food for your money. Our bill was $40 for everything, and I think this is what you expect when you want fast food Chinese!",3

After everything was said and done they remade the food and gave me a partial discount. Definitely wasn't worth it!

      I enjoyed a delicious order of spicy chicken and Szechuan noodles. The chicken was succulent and the hot peppers provide just the right amount of spice to warmly my tummy. The Szechuan noodles had a delicious vinegary tang which complemented the overall texture of the noodles. All in all food was 100% delicious.  I look forward to returning and sampling more of their menu. 

   The restaurant itself is not exactly Joel Roebeccions but seriously, it's China Town. The service was adequate however neither of the staff members spoke very good English and when I asked for something with Szechuan peppercorns they looked at me like I asked them to invent cold fusion on the spot.

Sometimes you just need some msg kick! The spicy chicken is really good here. It's salty, spicy, and MSG-y.  If you don't like chicken on the bone you won't like this dish but I'm like a dog chewing and sucking on the bone getting every spicy salty MSG drip out.

The spicy hot pots with lamb, beef, or shrimp is always a good staple and I always order some variation.  You will need 2 rounds (big ass bowls family style) to curb the burn.

We ordered 4 different dishes; the boiled lamb in hot pot, the pork intestines with hot peppers,  the pork blood and bean sprouts in hot pot, and a cold dish of beef and tripe.

The boiled lamb and the cold dish were the best dishes; both were decently done, but not spectacular. The flavor was okay, the quality of the lamb and beef were good, and the portion was right.  It's what you would expect of a quality szechuan place.

The pork intestines with hot peppers was a bad dish.  The intestines were properly cooked, but there was ZERO flavor with the dish.  It was as if the intestines were just deep fried and then thrown on top of hot peppers and not even stir fried with the rest of the ingredients.

The pork blood and bean sprouts in hot pot was just all over the place.  The flavro was fine, but the pork blood was not good.  It was low quality and overcooked.  Then also within the dish were slices of bologna.  BOLOGNA.  YES.  WTF?!?!  Why on earth would anyone put bologna in this dish as a filler?  I have no clue.........plus it wasn't mentioned on the menu.

All in all, this place actually isn't terrible, but it's definitely not what I would call good. The service is actually good, and our waitress was quite accommodating.  However, for szechuan food I really don't care about the service and decor as much as I do about the food.  Really it should be 2.5 stars, but I can't give it a 3.

http://www.thrillist.com/eat/las-vegas/best-chinatown-restaurants-in-vegas 

I ordered their bestselling sautéed spiced lamb, and it was just average good. It was very spicy, so they definitely got their Szechuan on, but I was a little disappointed with the portion. It felt like a lunch-sized portion, but I paid the full dinner price. Oh, and the rice was extra - really?

I would have to say that I agreed with most of the articles picks for best Chinatown eateries, at least the ones I have been to. J&Js was my first attempt at the ones I have not tried, and I am already disappointed. 

Not only do I think J&Js is not the best Szechuan in Chinatown, but its bestselling sautéed spiced lamb is not even the best Szechuan spiced lamb dish in Chinatown (that honor has to go to Yunnan Garden).

The crawfish with cucumber(?) was what we got- can't remember the actual name but we easily had over a pound of crawfish. They're not in season so they were small and not the freshest, but the dish itself was a good combination of chilis, seafood, and veggies- the sauce was addictively spicy and delicious.

But it was lunch time, and they were craving this lamb hotpot that they said was really big and good from this Chinese restaurant I don't know about by their Chinese name.

The restaurant turned out to be J & J Szechuan Cuisine, which I had bookmarked to try their lunch specials earlier this year.  The interior of the restaurant looks and feels really vintage (not in a good way). But from experience, I know some of the best Chinese food are served at this hole-in-the-wall type restaurants.  After we were seated and handed our menu, my friends proceed to order the Lamb Hot Pot (which they said was off the menu).  Sounds good.  I love the whole secret menu concept.

After a fair amount of time has passed and we have completely demolished the appetizers and the Cold Noodle we ordered, the waitress finally brought out the hot pot.  The reaction from my friends was that this was not what they were served on their previous visit. The portion is a lot smaller (as in about half of what they were served the last time).  So instead of it being a hearty large portion that could be split with 3 people, it was just enough to accommodate 2 people at the most.  It was a good thing that I was not hungry to begin with.  The noodle was also cooked so much that you can't even pick it out with a chopstick, as it has pretty much been cooked to mush.  They spoke to the waitress and asked why this did not look like what they ordered previously, but the waitress just argues back saying we do not remember what we ordered the last time.  Considering the portion is less than half of what my friends ordered the last time. And he took pictures of what he ordered from his previous visit. I highly doubt that. Smh.

When they asked if it can be returned, since it was so different from what was served before, the waitress just said no!

To add insult to injury (or is it injury to insult? I wonder which is worst) one of my friend found a random string from who knows what in the Lamb Hot Pot.  We should have taken a picture of it first.  Because when we showed it to the waitress, she dismissed it as just a piece of noodle (It is right there on our table. Try eating it!). Then she said it was the string from the noodle package and just picked it up without offering an apology. Yeah, that was about the only smart thing she did. Get rid of the evidence!

So inconsistency in what is served, even if it is a secret off the menu item, is already a big red flag for me to never return here again. But the fact that a foreign object was found in the food and the customer received the ""No F Given"" attitude when confronted about it, is just the final nail in the coffin.

So yeah, even by Asian/Chinese restaurant standards, this place has crap service and subpar food.  Thus probability of return is less than 0.1%.  But in the event of a zombie apocalypse, I will bookmark this place since it will still be low on other people's list of places to scavenge for food.

First of all the lady at the counter wasn't listening and kept screwing up our order but it was resolved before we paid so it was all good. 

Had the Bangus today with garlic fried rice and an over-hard egg. It was just aight. But still probably better than all the other items on their menu. I've had their lumpia before and wasn't fond of it at all. 6 tiny stale and overcooked pieces that just sucked. I also had their pulabok and that also just sucked. The only decent beverage would be the taho. Oh and the halo-halo is alright too. Don't bother getting the boba from here or jollibee. Well actually Jollibee's not as bad but still. You either get undercooked boba or frozen or maybe both. Idfk man I just hate eating here. I would rather spend my $8 at Chinatown where I could get my money's worth of some QUALITY food. 

The only reason I came her was because my aunt from Texas said they don't have Chow King there and in my mind I'm like ""well you aren't a missing out on anything special"" but I had to suck it up and pretended like I love coming to seafood city and eating all the mediocre food there.

Since it was dinner time this place was super packed and there was a line to order. Luckily since we only ordered dessert, our order was out pretty soon after we placed it. 

Since this is a fast food joint, the halo halo was served in a cup which made it a little difficult to eat...I felt like I had to eat each layer one by one because I was unable to mix it like I usually would with shaved ice or snow treats.

It's a madhouse here at times with really no order. Pure chaos.  I will give them dap for taking my aunt's order when she completely skipped the line at the service station.

People working at the cashier didn't even bother telling me it would take long. My whole family ate before I got my food and it was cold. This place is a complete joke of Filipino food. Do yourself a favor and cook at home.",1
681302,5LbsinUiNNrzlndhifRvHw,HZjLErXWi1vZWMgsAjBEeQ,"It was probably not a good idea to come on Christmas. Plus the tour buses were dropping off people in that plaza, too. We ended up sharing a table with strangers. That's Chinese restaurants for you. We didn't mind too much.. even kind of made some friends later, haha.

I've had this dish called Chongqing Spicy Chicken at Jugoo but now they no longer exist so what to do, what to do?!?!

Friend told me about this place because they have that exact dish BUT not the type of chicken I was expecting. It was deep fried or something and only decent at most. Disappointed with the chicken, but the dish is the same one, with all that influx of spices and such. A friend's mother says you're supposed to ask for the other type of chicken so I guess I could attempt that next time.

We only got two dishes. The one mentioned above and the Lamb with Cumin. YUMS. I would totally get that again and again. Of course, I'll probably try other dishes but that one is a plus. I'm not much of a spicy person cause it just tortures me but it's still so damn good.",4

YES! My family is from Yunnan, and while I would say this is not necessarily authentic Yunnan cuisine (I would say that it's difficult to find authentic Yunnan food in China aside from the actual province itself), it is the best spicy food restaurant in Las Vegas (and most likely in the state of Nevada). If you're in Las Vegas and are looking for some authentic Chinese cuisine, definitely come here! 

The reason why I do not give it a full 5 stars is because of the service. Just remember that while it might seem like the servers are rude, they aren't. It's just the way it is. This restaurant gets crowded really easily so you should try to avoid the popular hours of lunch and dinner. Either arrive a little earlier or a lot later. They have a new system in place where you grab a number and wait outside.

To the left of the entrance is a bar with some cold dishes. Definitely grab some for the table to snack on while you wait for your order to be taken and for the food to come out. All the dishes were flavorful (though some were a bit oily... so if you're watching your grease intake, be wary :P) - 

-Definitely try Yunnan Rice Noodle Soup (guo qiao mi xian) - a well known Yunnan dish (the dish here is lacking in the soup, but there aren't many places in the US that get this dish right) 
-Some other great dishes to try out - Boiled Fish with Sichuan Special Sauce; Szechuan style spicy lamb chop; Pork with chinese celery and green pepper; Stir-fried pork intestines with pickled pepper; Lamb with cumin",4
681304,WprDmlRVXmB7vHQSIgf2vA,HZjLErXWi1vZWMgsAjBEeQ,"Looking for good spicy Szechuan food?  This is your place.  I have been meaning to try this place since I moved to Las Vegas a year and a half ago, but it wasn't until this past winter break did I actually get a chance to go.  My husband and I came at the end of the lunch rush on a Friday and were able to share a table with another party of four right away.  It didn't bother us, but it is just a heads up you are in a small group and it is busy.

There was a large extensive menu and we probably didn't order the most popular dishes, but they were delicious!  

Mapo Tofu - Chunks of soft tofu surrounded by perfectly flavor sauce.  It is vegetarian friendly (not that I'm vegetarian, but I thought I'd share) and was everything that I wanted it to be.  It was marked as spicy, but I felt that it was pretty mild.  I might have felt this because the other dish we ordered was really spicy.  After I sample a couple of their other dishes, I'm sure I will order this again

Chongqing Spicy Chicken - Soooooo Good!! At first it is a little scary because the perfectly fried chicken pieces are surrounded with chunks of chilies, but it was amazing!  The batter was light and very well-seasoned.  This is spicy, but not in the ""OMG my mouth is on fire where is the water?"" kind of way, it is has the occasional bite that numbs your taste buds, but it comes back in a couple of minutes.  I know that doesn't sound appealing, but if you avoid those chilies it is so worth it!

I will without a doubt be back!  I can't wait to update my review when I get to try more dishes.",4
681305,wtN2aIEEkfenv9xHfE54rg,HZjLErXWi1vZWMgsAjBEeQ,"2014.  Welcome to the new year, and welcome to the new menu pricing.  A sad day when the prices go up significantly.  The food is wonderful, it used to be worth driving from a long ways away to eat here, but the prices all went up to ring in the holidays, and now it's time to find someplace else.  The pity is, they have you with the taste (authentic and awesome), so I know I'll end up back here again...

Note that when it's super busy, they will not do take away orders!",4
681306,KuCD9EZxUUgWu0XZkl7YLw,HZjLErXWi1vZWMgsAjBEeQ,"Get to know the owners here if you're a spicy food lover- Szechuan Chinese is the way to go! Overall good quality, but on the oily side. This is to be expected for this type of food. Read on, I'm recommending the four to five star dishes.

We came with a huge group and tested their kitchen with ravenous appetites. It's an impressive sight to see a group of Asians, not one over 5 foot six, demolish 30 some plates in less than a couple hours. Coney Island All American hot dog eating contest, here we come!

For appetizers the pig ear disappeared in seconds and the tofu slices were second. For main dishes I highly recommend the Mapo tofu: the tofu was soft and silky and the dish got the flavors right. Also good is their stir fried kidney (sounds strange but walk on the wild side!), tasted fresh with a consistency between squid and bamboo shoot. Lastly their home brewed chicken soup finishes off a dinner that set your tastebuds on fire.",3
681307,sgHVGq71wszphYhTMOK0ng,HZjLErXWi1vZWMgsAjBEeQ,"I've been meaning to try this place and last night, I finally got to go with one of my friends. My friend had already bee to this place about twice before so he knew his way around, which was very helpful! I was pleasantly surprised that when I walked it, it was already semi-busy -- it wasn't like SLAMMED but it held a good decent amount of people. Almost all of the tables were already taken. 

So my friend and I got seated, then some menus arrive, and then I start looking. Well, almost nothing looked familiar. Which was fine, but sometimes it's a little overwhelming but I do know that the one thing I want was LAMB. Anddd I left the decision to my friend HAHA :)

He ended up ordering lamb with cumin, fish and pig intestines boiled in chili oil, and chong qing spicy chicken.

Lamb with cumin: this dish came with a bunch of jalapeno peppers, red peppers, onions, and cilantro. It was delicious and by far, my favorite. I simply love lamb and cumin -- it is a wonderful taste. If you are unfamiliar with cumin, you may not get used to the flavor right away but trust me, this is the way to go. There is no better way of eating lamb than having it cooked with cumin. Definitely a dish you have to order when you're eating at Yunnan Garden. I also loved eating the jalapeno peppers from this dish too. Some were spicy and some were real spicy!

Fish and pig intestines boiled in chili oil: they actually messed up our order and gave us fish with pork instead of pork intestine but they later on corrected it. Anyways this dish didn't seem spicy to me at all ... but that's probably because I was eating the jalapeno peppers from the lamb dish? In fact, it really didn't do anything for me. The fish was good to eat and pig intestines is always a favorite of mine but the flavors were kind of bland. I was expecting some spicy action going on and this dish did not deliver :(

Chong qing spicy chicken: we originally ordered this and asked them to sub chicken wing for it cause according to my friend, it tastes better....but that didn't happen. Apparently they didn't have chicken wings. This dish, like the previous, did not deliver. I wasn't too interested in the flavors of this dish but one of the reasons could be that I was never really interested in popcorn chicken to begin with. And other than the numbing effect from the chicken, there wasn't much from it. The flavors just didn't wow me or captivate me, and wasn't really that spicy.

Perhaps I'm just not into the Yunnan style of cuisine. 

One thing that I did NOT appreciate was that at the end of our dinner, they pretty much rushed us out even though there weren't any customers waiting for a table. When my friend went to use the restrooms, a server literally came over and asked if I wanted to box one of my dishes -- which was fine cause I was done. Then she boxed it, bagged it, and proceeded to take all the dishes, including the tea. Before she even finished, another server came with the check. O....kay? When I put my credit card down, it got swooped up quick and was charged in a minute. 

I filled out their portion of the receipt. Then I was filling out mine with the final price but before I got to set the pen down or put the receipt in my wallet, the server came over here and decided to explain to me that the receipt I was holding was mine. She said that I didn't need to sign it and it was my copy to keep. Thank you for that but you could have at least waited to see if I really was going to give you both copies first. It's like saying, ""Oh thank you for giving me both gifts but you didn't have to!!"" Well gee, they weren't both for you but thanks for assuming. I know which copy is yours and which is mine. I mean, I supposed it's nice of her, but I was already annoyed that she took away the TEA before I was done and that just kind of annoyed me a little bit more. 

I typically like to enjoy a cup of tea or two after a meal and before I leave the restaurant. I appreciate their fast service cause sometimes, it is hard at other restaurants to close the check. But damn, my friend didn't even come back from his restroom trip and you already took away everything AND charged my card. He couldn't even get a last cup of tea. I've never had that happen to me at a restaurant before. And I guess I know now ... you do not take my tea away from me! 

Would I come back? Probably. I'd come back just for the lamb with cumin dish. Maybe try something new as well. But I'll remember to have to hold onto my tea stuff at the end.

A tip. Try to bring someone Chinese with you. These servers loved talking to us in mandarin and unfortunately, that was not our native tongue. We understood but we couldn't really reply. Their English wasn't that great either. There was a younger server whose English was decent -- she at least understood what we were saying to her in English.",3
681308,gkBYuh19e9vm3whNgno8nw,HZjLErXWi1vZWMgsAjBEeQ,"I've actually been here quite a few times, twice in the past month or so. Probably been here maybe total 10 times or so, so far? But none of the times have i seen this place so packed. Last time i came here, granted it was xmas day, so it got to the point where my friend and i ""dap toi"" (cantonese saying) which pretty much means, multiple parties sitting at the same table, just for the sake of having a table to use, period. 

This time, i came with my friend, on a sunday night, and it was pretty packed, almost full, but not to point where people were waiting at the front for a table. 

The two times, had some overlapping dishes so will describe it when it comes

Lamb with cumin: This time, my friend is a huge fan of lamb and cumin (skewers) so i decided to order that. Both this time and last time, flavor was pretty spot on, if anything that i had to critique, was not enough lamb. Aside from that, the jalepenos was a hit n miss on if it was spicy or not, but flavor wise, with the cumin... Delicious ! Probably was the ""spiciest"" dish of them all. 

Chong Qing La Zi Ji (Spicy chicken w/ chilis): First time, i had ordered this, i was expecting it to come as cut chicken wings, but this time, it was like, popcorn chicken. Cuz i SWEAR, thats how it was before. Thinking it may have changed, we decided to eat it. After talking with my mom, who i have came here many times with before, she said you had to specially request it to be made with wings. Ok, so this time, I had specifically asked the waitress for chicken wing, she said ok. When the order came, it was the ""popcorn chicken"" style again. Asked another waitress why it was this, and not the chicken wing i had asked for, and she mentioned they dont do chicken wing, only this style. HMMM.... (more later) but back to flavor, it was like popcorn chicken fried with dried red peppers. I mean, its seasoned nicely, but hey! wheres the spiciness ?! 

""Water Boiled Fish"" (Fished cooked in chili oil): Didnt get it last time, but ordered it this time because this friend loves spicy. Originally, i had asked for water and pork intestines, but the first time it came out, I dont know if the waitress who took our order didnt understand (more later) or what, but it came out fish and pork. like pork cut into little strips. Asked a different waitress, had it re-done with fish and pork intestine (why they use pork instead of pig, i dont know....) When it came out, its either their chef changed or style changed. i dont recall the sauce being so thick. Back then, when it came out, you could almost swear theres like a centimeter of red chili oil on top. Flavor was fine but as with the previous dish, not spicy. 

So usually after dinner, not only for chinese, but any other cuisine as well, you like to sit there and rest, drink some tea/soda/water/etc, and let the food settle a bit before leaving. For some odd reason, they seemed to be rushing. I mean, if it was busy, like it was on X'mas, its understandable, but it wasnt THAT busy. I had went to the restroom while my friend finished up eating. After i came back, i was told that the lady came to box up leftovers, cleaned EVERYTHING up including our tea and tea cups, brought her the check, took it and charged her, and brought it back, all within the period of me going to the restroom. WOW! I mean thats great they are so fast, but what the heck? We felt really rushed at the end. NO GOOD ! 

I swear they used to be more spicy, and better on their accuracy. I mean, even the mapo tofu was spicy enough to make me choke sometimes, let alone these few dishes we had ordered. I was sweating, but no where near how much i used to sweat, due to the spiciness. 

Ok now to emphasize on the ""more later"" parts. Since being seated, they love speaking to you in mandarin. Granted both times, we were able to understand, but this time, we understand, but arent fluent enough to reply. I'm not sure if its their style to be against those who can't speak mandarin or what. I'll probably give them one more chance, with my mom next time. If still off, welp.... you know what that means..",4

When we went one evening we were the only non-Asian people in the restaurant.  Service was quick but not what you would call friendly.  At exactly 10pm (closing time), the waitress came over with the check and asked us to pay then so they could close out the registers.  

The food, however, was fantastic.  The entrees come with huge portions and are definitely not the Americanized fare you find in most American-Chinese restaurants.  My partner got a dish of lamb ribs about the size of a finger.  I tried the kung pao chicken.  The chicken was delicious but extremely spicy.

The ONLY downside is, the staff is a bit awkward if you're not Asian. I'm half Asian, but I don't look like it. The bf is very white. They weren't as friendly with us and not as tentative to us. And the waiter was very awkward, like he didn't know what he was doing. 
But you know what??? It's so freaking good, I don't give a shit!

 This is the place the Asian's go to. So - that's your sign.
We had -

Spicy beef dry pot
Spicy lamb pot
Spicy pork and wonton soup w/ rice noodles
Kung pow shrimp

Everything...EVERYTHING was amazing. Probably some of the best authentic Chinese food I've ever had.

I definitely recommend the pots - if you're looking for something different and full of flavor.

Also, this place is insanely cheap. We for 4 dishes for $50. That is insane. There was only two of us, but we love leftovers. Most places we go, we pay $60+ for 2 dishes with drinks.

We waited for almost 15 minutes, no one came to apologize for the mess up, and what really pissed me off and finally decided to walk out of the restaurant is when I told the the owner about what happened, he replied and said regardless if we made a reservation or not, they are too busy, if they don't have a table ready for us, we just have to wait!

I'm with  my family and my brother so we walk into this place and it is packed and we are the only non-asian people in the place (I took that as a good sign).  Anyhow when I asked for crispy noodles the waitress looked at me like I was from Mars.  The Chinese lady in the table next to me came to my rescue when she overheard me and knew what I was talking about and began explaining to the waitress what I wanted in Chinese.  She quickly smiled and looked at me and said they don't serve crispy noodles here, at least not the type you are thinking of.  

I'm thinking boy I must look like your typical American moron, so I quietly began looking at the menu for dishes that looked familiar.  I settled for a scallions and onions, a kungpao plate, some of the speciality fried rice, a noodle bowl with some of the more exotic meats like stomach, and a couple of other dishes that were recommended by our neighbor friend.   I must say I have never eaten such good food.  All of the dishes were amazing. It was one of the most enjoyable and best tasting meals I have had in a long time.  I wasn't the only one in our group that felt that way.  We all raved about how good it was.  I don't think we left a crumb of food on any of the plates.

Ok, it fantastic but...

Its the best Chinese food in Las Vegas for Yunnan style food. If you are from North Dakota and eat Egg rolls and General Chows chicken, you will not like this place. Go to Panda Express. Do not expect beef and broccoli.

If you have an understanding of very fresh Home made Southern Chinese food and like spicy well made dishes, this is your place. (They do have some non-spicy dishes)

Do expect super fresh, very well made food. (Not much sea food here).

The have cold appetizers that are great. After you get a table, go up to the cash register. You will see all of them laid out. You can get 3 on a plate. I like the dried beef, cucumber and cabbage.

They have a fish dish that is simple and does not smell like fish. No bones. Not one. Its so tender. Its the fish filet in brown sauce with garlic. Its not spicy. I think its #58

Their soups are very good.

I love their beef in spicy szechuan sauce and the wonton in chile sauce. Kung Pao chicken is great!

You can feed 8 people for under $100. 

The decor is sparse. But the food divine. Do not go here on Christmas (oy vey). 
This is real Chinese food. Tour buses full of people from China go here. 

The wait staff is very attentive. You can take a cab from the strip. Its not far. Just off Spring Mtn Rd. It is hard to find as its hidden in a strange strip mall. Good for me, I know where it is.

This is not your typical Chinese food style. Many dishes are spicy but there are some that are not. Give it a try. You will love it.

UPDATE: 4/30/14
Looks like they raised the prices a little bit.
Just as good as ever.",5

My pork with preserved vegetables was delicious and authentic, with real Szechuan pepper. The wait staff don't have much English and our waitress tried to talk me out of that dish as especially spicy but I was glad I went with it. I've missed food like that.

The Ma Po Tofu was also equally amazing; tofu was excellent quality and flavors were very pleasing.  The Spicy chicken had me drenched in sweat but was well worth it.

I ordered the rice noodles with spicy ground pork and it looked good but after the first taste.....Disappointed!!!! 

There were no sriracha!!!! Seriously? !!!! How come you do not have sriracha??! You have to have sriracha at any Chinese restaurant! !! 

The soup base was OK but when you mix the spicy ground meat with the noodle.....it was wayyyy to oily!!! It was not even spicy.

 Ri long",1
681349,HVfjivncqvtXt_5i_-SF2g,HZjLErXWi1vZWMgsAjBEeQ,"Dad and I went here for an early dinner; it was memorable.

Food:  I ordered the chongqing shrimp and ma po tofu; dad ordered fish and garlic in brown sauce.  My shrimp dish didn't come with extra peppercorns like I asked but tasted very good still, the ma po was spot on, and Dad's fish in brown sauce was the best of the evening.  His fish was very tender, huge pieces of garlic and ginger provided for surprising taste explosions and the brown sauce was delicious.  My shrimp was spicy and tasted delicious; however, there's simply too high of a chili-to-meat ratio for my liking this time; plus no extra peppercorns for the tingle sensation on the tongue.  The ma po was silky smooth with a delicious, rich-red chili base, fresh scallions, and tofu that when you break them open they reveal pure white.

Service:  Our waitress that took the order was clearly irritated.  She started off by mean mugging  a customer (who had just walked in the door); saying, ""I want to eat my dinner"".  Now I totally understand being hungry and needing to eat but, YOU WORK IN A RESTAURANT; you can eat anytime; at least try not to look so mean infront of us.  I repeated my order three times, the third was the charm, after I told her I didn't order three of the same dishes but one dish that was totally different.  I asked for extra peppercorns upon examining my spicy shrimp and found that there were hardly any, so I asked a nearby staff member who when asked if I could have extra peppercorns she replied by shaking her head ""no"" and looking at me like I was a dumbass.  After Our first serving of water that was the last time we saw any service for at least three quarters the entire meal.  The entire staff were seated at the large main table in front of the door, all texting, all the time making brief eye contact with us and ignoring our H2O needs.  Finally, I just stuck my hand up high while holding my empty water glass when the young man was looking my way and shook it; he understood and thankfully left the pitcher on our table.  After we had our fill I had to do a similar gesture to get someone's attention for the bill.  One thing is for sure; the service sucks but the food is great!

Atmosphere:  Clean and tasty water, complimentary hot green tea with meal.  Table seating with a small deli-like section towards the front of the restaurant.  Seating space is somewhat limited and just a warning:  Avoid sitting at the first table to the left of the door, you'll be blasted repetitively by either hot air from outside in the summer and cold air in the winter...not fun.  Very plain interior, could use some authenticity, unless this is authentic yunnan-style restaurant interior?

Price:  Not too bad for the quality and taste. i wish they provided more information on their menu regarding the ingredients in the dishes.  For example; what kind of fish did we have tonight; we have no clue and the waitress couldn't understand our question to provide an answer, and what deliciousness is in their Ma Po Tofu.  I'm not suggesting they reveal every single ingredient, but the main ingredients would be nice.

Overall:

I would definitely come back.  I think I'll stick to their seafood and the Ma Po Tofu for sure!  I'm really curious how their lamb tastes...looks delicious.  Authentic Sichuan flavor to be sure.",5
681350,9wqbWythcS-MoFzNqmugIw,HZjLErXWi1vZWMgsAjBEeQ,"One of the better meals we had off The Strip. We ate Cumin Lamb, Dry Chili Chicken and beef chow mein.

Easy to miss the ""street"" since it's a small sign for a parking lot and not an actual street so slow down once you're near to avoid missing it.

We got our usual go-to szechuan dishes: the suai ju yui (water cooked fish in Chilli oil sauce), mapo tofu (no meat), sautéed string beans (no meat), and spicy sour clear noodles. Also got a 3 choice cold app plate. Good portion sizes as we took home the majority of the tofu and fish dishes despite the fact that we were starving since we just finished a bikram class.

Food came quick after we ordered and everything was flavorful with lots of garlic/spices, not overly or just simply oily like some szechuan spots.",4
681353,Qn9_-b4YH4XdOzbs8L16UQ,HZjLErXWi1vZWMgsAjBEeQ,"This place is Terrible. I can't believe I wasted a Vegas meal on this place. Where do you go for the best Chinese food? Chinatown right? WRONG. So we walk into this place and are greeted with obvious shock and surprise, like what are you doing here? It was bizarre to say the least. We sit down and look at the menu, lots of choices most of which are spicy. We sat there for quite some time before a waitress came to take our order, she couldn't speak English very well so we pointed to the item which was also written in Chinese. The food comes out one dish at a time. We ordered house fried rice. Which turned out to be shaved cured pork belly, not bacon mind you..think salty pork, green onion and rice with an overwhelming flavor of fish sauce. It was also quite oily. Our second dish of pork spare ribs in sweet and sour sauce comes. The flavor is good but there is very little meat and mostly bone in bite sized pieces. It's not cool to be fishing in your mouth for bones especially when you feel like your being observed by patrons and staff alike. The third dish of smoked duck comes, clearly it is liquid smoke, not true smoked meat. Nothing good about this meal. I am not a rude person so we asked our server to box the leftovers so as not to insult them. I told her she could just put it in one box. I believe this offended her as she was adamant that they be put in separate boxes...ok, we walked out of there and immediately threw it in the trash which was our intent from the beginning. Hence the one box. Don't go here...fair warning. Hard lesson learned. I will be eating on the strip for my Chinese food fix from now on. I almost forgot a very angry lady came inside to complain about their delivery driver, apparently he cut her off or something in the parking lot. She asked to talk to him but the waitresses never went and got him. They were rude to her and she left very upset.",1

Everytime were in Vegas we get good here but what a disappointment. I was gonna give them a chance if the food tasted the same but it didnt. I think the prices for the food we got were outrageous.

This is Szechwan Chinese food at it's finest. 

Short recap - this is a get in and get out kind of place. It was INSANELY busy last night and they were trying to just get people seated, served and get them out. 
Again, don't expect excellent customer service here, just expect the best Chinese food you may ever have here in the states. It's the best. 

We brought my boyfriend's parents here last night and they haven't had much authentic Chinese food, and they were very impressed. 

The best thing we had last night was the Rice Noodles w/ Sweet and Sour soup and spicy pork stew. I can't even begin to tell you how amazing the taste is with this soup. It's a perfect blend of spices, herbs, the cilantro that gives it that nice topping and just the pork itself...mouth watering. 

We also shared:
Cured pork with green beans, which was okay. It was more like cripsy dried out bacon. It was the only thing I've ever ordered that I wasn't a fan of. 
Cumin Lamb, always a favorite. Not too spicy, but the cumin in it is very strong. So be prepared. 
Garlic Shrimp, good, but not my favorite. A good dish if you can't have soy. 
Chongqing Spicy Shrimp, awesome. This is one of the most recommended dishes and I see why. It is friend with tempura, but it's so bold, spicy and full of flavor.

Overall, I absolute LOVE this place. It's so good and the prices are still very reasonable for the amazing quality this place has. They raised the prices by $5-7 per dish. But again, it's so worth it. 

Be prepared to wait, but also be prepared to be amazed. This is Chinese like you've never had it. You'll never wanted Americanized again.",5

We came on Christmas Eve since we were with our Chinese relatives from china and they much prefer Chinese food over American cuisine. Found this place with a quick search on yelp. There is ample parking and this is located adjacent to the Chinatown plaza. We had a party of 9 and was still seated right away. Let me just take a moment and add a fat shiny star for their extra speedy service. Have you been to jimmy johns before? This is seriously almost as quick as that but way more quality food. I swear this place gave me my dinner faster than any fast food places. I wouldn't say the service was good but the speed makes up for it. 

As for the food, it is so good! Even my Chinese relatives said it taste like the food in china! Definitely not americanized. I loved the chicken feet and even bought some extra for later. I also really enjoyed the pickled sprouts, cucumber, mapo tofu, and spicy fish. My spicy chicken mi fen noodle was good and warm! Not too spicy and tasted so good with the other appetizers we ordered. I was very stuffed and we still took a lot of leftovers:) it was definitely one of those homey, satisfying meals! If you are in Vegas and craving a good, delicious and simple Chinese meal, this is the place to try! I enjoyed it more than those fancy American expensive dinners:)",4

We ordered a general tao, vegetable fried rice, and fried dumplings (I think), and they were all really good and tasted fresh. I don't even really like general tao, but this one was great! 

It was a little pricey, costing $22 for three items, but the portions are pretty big.

Although it was midafternoon, I was still surprised that we were the only diners in the place. Maybe that's because the food was hit and miss.

Whenever I try a new thai restaurant, I always order the pad thai. This was a goopy concoction with oversweet sauce and rubbery shrimp. Not appealing at all. My husband lucked out in ordering the beef and snow peas. The meat was served in a tasty teriyaki sauce with crunchy snow peas, onions, and water chestnuts. His fried rice was so-so, and our spring rolls were obviously frozen, but each of our soups (egg drop for him, hot and sour for me) was good, and our server was prompt and pleasant.

This restaurant is far enough away from my house that I'll probably never return. But Little Dumpling better step up its game if it wants to lure diners in a strip mall that's filled with other ethnic offerings. Next time I'm in the neighborhood, I think I'll stop in next door at Geisha House. (Or I might just opt for a Costco hot dog...)",2

It was like going to work ER at the emergency room. The containers were all heavily sauced as they had been thrown around like basketballs. Check out the pictures of the attempted triage of the nasty situation here if you want. 

This was outrageous and we really thought that people should know what they're getting to go from here.

Kids sweet and sour comes with the sauce on the side which is nice the chicken and rice are enough food the horribly awful  ragoons should just me left off the meal bc they are defiantly the worst in town. 
Decor is kinda intimate so it's very surprising they have a kids menu. First glance this place does not look kid friendly.

 I ordered water to drink and he got pink lemonade. This is going to sound crazy, but that water was disgusting. It was stinky and had a horrible after taste. Seriously! Water! I got nervous because I've never had ""bad"" water while eating out. My husband's drink had the same fully after taste. 

I had the corn and egg soup. It wasn't bad or good so that was kind of a wash. 

My husband hand the chicken chili mint. That's his favorite Thai dish. It didn't really look or taste like the traditional chicken chili mint. It wasn't really spicy and was covered in a thick sauce which is not normal either. I had the General Taos Chicken lunch meal that comes with, fried rice and crab rangoon. 

The Chicken was good at first but half way through the extremely sweet taste was too much. It was almost like it was covered in a marmalade. The crab rangoons which are always my favorite were also extremely sweet in the filling. It was almost like frosting in taste and texture. Not pleasant, so I didn't finish the 1st one let alone touch the second. The fried rice was bland. I mean really bland. It was eating white rice that just looked brown. 

Needless to say, we won't be going back there at all. I guess we've been spoiled with the food at other places like the Bangkok Orchid in Green Valley.
 
Now if I could just get this awful after taste to go away! It's been a few hours!",1

It was ok, it didn't exceed expectations nor did it disappoint. the service could have been better considering when we got there, we were one of two parties there at the time (we had two people, the other had three) but it was ok. the lighting was very dark but I think is was a blown out bulb so easy fix. we got the family meal A. with egg fu yung and pad thai with bbq pork fried rice. The spring roll and cheese ragoon was pretty good. the spring roll had a nice light crunch and the veggies inside were tasty.  the cheese ragoon could have been a dessert but im not complaining it tasted like the filling of a cream cheese pie with a nice crunchy fried shell. the egg fun yung was different from what i had in the past and it was deconstructed.  the egg was just egg and onion and the rest (veggies and bbq pork) was just on top. The gravy could have used a little more salt and so could the eggs, the pad thai was ok. a little too sweet for my tastes and the sauce was very thin and didn't really stick to the noodles. The bbq pork fried rice was a little bland but very dark in color which was also a little different from what I have had in the past. I was happy I tried this place as I was not disappointed or surprised. I dont mind trying small hole in the wall places as it may be a hidden gem.... looks like I am still on the hunt.",3

Ok, first thing first...there is barely any thai items on the menu. I asked if they made pad see ew and was told no! Most items appeared to be chinese of panda express quality. I ordered yellow curry and my boyfriend general tso chicken. After 10 minutes the waiter returned to tell me they didnt have any curry! Its on their menu?? So I ended up just ordering potstickers and a thai tea. My boyfriends chicken came up first and it looked like it was covered in a thick, jam like sauce. When you picked up a piece it actually had strings of sau e from it like a thick syrup. Gross! My boyfriends ice tea sat empty on the table the entire time and my potstickers finally arrived 10 minutes after his meal. We had to remind the waiter about the thai tea which was honestly the best part of the meal. The pot stickers were average at best.

I notified a waitress that we were seating ourselves.  She brought us menus, our food, and then we sat and sat waiting for our check when we were finished.  My husband was ready to walk out without paying when I finally just walked over to our waitress again and told her we needed our check.  Honestly, there are not that many tables and there was plenty of wait staff, but the whole timing was way off.  The couple next to us ordered their food not long after us, but ended up just watching us eat, as their food never came.  We would have just walked out.  We left before they were ever served.

I will list prices with the items as I recall them. Taking a browse through older reviews, I see some items have almost doubled in price. 

First of all, we over-ordered. This is common for us. We had...

Pan fried pork buns. $12. So, I'm usually not a fan of any bun or dumpling if it has an excessively thick dough surrounding it that seems uncooked. Luckily, it was a bit airy and crispy, with delicious pork in the middle. Not a lot of juice or soup, but still tasty. Served upside-down.

Stir-fried spinach with garlic. $14?! Simple and to the point. It was good.

Seasoned cold tofu. $7-8. Standard appetizer if you're familiar with it. Simple and tasty.

Eggplant and basil in a heated pot. $16?!?! I loved this dish. Good, strong flavors and perfect over rice due to the thick consistency of the sauce. I think I should have put the flame out underneath it, though. It got too mushy by the end.

""Three sauce"" chicken in a heated pot. $17?!?!?!?! So, the sauce is a very strong ginger and sugar with some other things type of flavor. Delicious flavor, but the cuts of chicken were so fatty I couldn't eat half of it. It's just random pieces.

Tea. Free? This had to be some of the most intense jasmine tea I've had without being bitter.

So yeah. It's confusing. Why is a place off the strip putting up some of the highest prices I've ever seen for Chinese/Taiwanese cuisine? Insane. I mean really, why is an eggplant dish $16?! I'd rather go to Bund Shanghai a couple blocks away. It's cheaper by a lot, and more delicious (although not exactly the same cuisine, but still).",3
735636,UO2_0pgC2tTkTQia0VBhiQ,NhpdNYXoRofaa649drCz3g,"China Mama is fighting for their three stars with me. More things disappoint me about this place than impress me on more reasons than one.

The restaurant as a whole is a nice place and the staff was very friendly with my family. When I opened the menu, I saw the prices of the items on the menu. Personally, I think the prices of the items on the menu are a little high. My family ordered vegetable chow mien, vegetable fried rice, braised tofu (I think), crispy beef, and sweet and sour fish fillet. When the chow mien, fried rice, and braised tofu came out, I personally thought that we could have gotten a little more food or the prices could be a little less, but I like large amounts of food in front of me. I did enjoy the fried rice and chow mien though, I thought they were cooked really well. These two would justify a higher rating in this review, but the crispy beef and sweet & sour fish fillet brought the rating down. The crispy beef was good and so was the sweet & sour fish fillet, but they put too much sauce in both and it was too sweet. In the crispy beef, about half was beef and half was carrots, which was a turn off, and then it was paired with too much sauce that was sweet. The sweet and sour fish fillet had even more sauce than the crispy beef did and it was too sweet. When you got to the fish after wiping all that sauce inside of your mouth, the fish was delicious, but I couldn't get past the large amount of sauce and the sweetness of it. I don't believe you can ask for sauce on the side for the crispy beef, but the sweet and sour fish, you most definitely should. 

This isn't a bad Chinese place to eat at, just don't order something sweet and sour unless you put the sauce on the side so you can control how much sauce you put yourself. The prices may be a little high, but the food does taste good. In the end, the decision is in your hands.",3

The seaweed strips in it really add a unique flavor that I have missed from others. The soup dumplings are fantastic and be sure to ask for the side of ginger.

My boyfriend didn't like the sweetness of the crispy beef, but I definitely enjoyed the taste and the perfect crisp. My boyfriend liked everything else greatly.

All my favorites hadn't changed and the tastes were consistent. Beef roll is always a must and I like a lot of their buns. Their menu is extensive, so it's hard to narrow it down during the ordering process. I like a lot of their veggie options, so I usually order at least one. There are so many options in town, so that explains why I don't come here as often as I used to, but it's a good option when you're craving variety.",4

The dumplings were ok but the high price tag made them even less attractive. At 11 dollars for 8 dumplings in which the majority of them were broken...not worth it.

Oh Yelp... 

No, more accurately, oh Las Vegas Yelp.... 

I don't know what to say. I got on Talk and BLASTED the mediocrity that is Las Vegas Thai food. Boo, hiss-hiss, what a meanie I am! Worse part is, I think I'm banned from every Thai Restaurant in the city. Now where am I going to get my pineapple fried rice and sweet and sour chicken??? Mercy... please! 

China Mama is a Las Vegas institution of sorts, so I have to tread lightly. I *think* it has to do with Las Vegas' most beloved food critic (who shall remain nameless), who seems to have a soft spot for China Mama. (TBH: his glowing praise is what got me to try it.) He probably likes it because not every other dish is saturated with ketchup, soy  sauce, and fried chicken (aka, Panda Express). But if this is the ""best"" Chinese food in Las Vegas... I dunno what to say. 

The food is okay, it's authentic, as authentic as the food I ate growing up in SGV. And it's a welcome break from Orange Chicken and beef chow mein. But c'mon... it's authentic mediocrity. The XLB are decent and waaay overpriced (8 dumplings for $9). The beef in their beef roll is nothing special, although their flour pancake was awesome. Again, another $7. Their chicken corn soup was disgusting. The best dish of the meal was the gringo boyfriend's Beef with Broccoli. Oh... and an extra 50 cents for a BOWL of white rice. Wut? 

I'm not trying to be a cheapskate, but to Asians, especially Chinese, the price point of a meal is important. If a restaurant's food is mediocre in taste, it better have an excellent price point. This place would be banned in the SGV on principle alone,  it's mediocre (sometimes bad) food with a very high price point. 

So, why the 4-stars? Well, I gotta get my beef roll fix somewhere. I have to give it props for having so many of my hometown's favorite dishes. And I don't want to get Mama mad. You know how China mamas get....",4

I'm very picky about my Chinese food. Nothing here like NYC, San Francisco, or believe it or not, Sao Paulo, Brazil. 

China Mama was reccomended to us by someone at one of the Chinese Foot Spas. Either they have warped taste buds, or I didn't tip them enough and they were getting even with me. 

First, good luck finding parking in this center. If you find a space, it truly is a pot of gold. It will be your one great accomplishment and more satisfying then your meal. 

We went with another couple, so we were able to order a variety of dishes. I found them to be a cut above Panda Express, and that's about it. Service was slow, and a couple of the dishes were on the cold side. When we sent them back, they must have been given first in line at the microwave oven. They looked exactly the same, just now steaming. 

I do remember the ""hot and sour"" soup, the chow main, and my standard for rating, Kung Pao Chicken. Not worth even taking home and reheating for a lunch.

Tough to park, slow service, and over priced.

735656,u9qMQ26V0eNaPBX_fMR9lA,NhpdNYXoRofaa649drCz3g,"I brought my parents here for lunch and I have to say that my Chinese baba and Korean mama were not too China happy. I could tell, of course, they were trying to be supportive of their ""radical"" daughter and relished in my lunch spot decision-making since they saw how excited I was to try it but underneath the approving smiles, I could tell they weren't impressed. China Mama serves a floral Jasmine tea, which I'm not a big fan of. I'd rather have my usual black tea to wash the grease down my esophagus, but that's just ME! I think the dishes here had a Northern Chinese influence and I'm more used to Hong Kong style, which I understand isn't their fault and I am completely open to trying everything (trust me when I say everything).

At first I was extremely overjoyed to hear that there was a restaurant in this city that serves soup dumplings. I could barely contain my excitement walking through the restaurant doors but my heart dropped just a little when I saw how empty it was. There were a couple tables having lunch when I went at 12 noon on a Monday. So, back to the soup dumplings. They were just OKAY... They didn't taste homemade and the texture was very doughy and dry. I was expecting the soup inside the dumplings to be more thin and broth-like but had a pretty thickened consistency, I'm assuming from the starch of the dough it was wrapped in.

Also, here's a question for some other China Mama patrons:

I ordered the Beef Dry Noodle with the hand pulled wide noodle. The density of the noodle was fabulous! BUT there was a very unusual flavor to them. My mouth got numb every time I ate them and it's a fuzzy feeling I've never experienced before. The beef and veggies in the same dish did not have this effect on me. I AM NOT allergic to anything (thank goodness) but am wondering if maybe I got a bad batch? The noodles tasted like some sort of chemical or cleaning solution? We asked the server if she could tell us what was in the dish to see if there was just a spice or ingredient that I am not familiar with but to no avail. I didn't want to make it a bigger deal than it really was so we left it at that. So, if any of you have ever tried it and know what I'm talking about, tell me if I'm crazy or if this is how it's supposed to taste! Thank you in advance for your cooperation! This strange taste made the noodle somewhat unbearable for me and I tried it a couple times, only because that's my motto; Try it twice, to be precise! 

Here are some gems I DID find on the menu:

Spicy Wontons! - SMOTHERED in garlic with a spicy chili oil sauce 
Beef Rolls - thinly sliced beef wrapped in a wonderfully oily, slightly crisp tortilla with a little hoisin (tortilla reminded me of Roberto's and I kept dipping this bad boy in the garlic chili oil concoction that came with the wontons)
Spicy Meat Combination - I love pig ear! There's nothing better than gelatinous meat!

All in all, China Mama was good but not great... And this was heartbreaking! I SOOO wanted to make this my, ""You've gotta try this place!"" recommendation to colleagues and friends but I guess I'll have to hold out until I find ""the one"". You'll get your soup dumpling fix here but don't expect it to be the best you've ever had. 

Stay classy Las Vegas and thanks for stopping by.",3
735657,N5BMMU2z47IMlckcAKeEpA,NhpdNYXoRofaa649drCz3g,"Four-and-a-Half Shiny Stars for China Mama Restaurant!  I'm super picky about my Chinese food because many of the restaurants cater to the Western palate.  China Mama is as authentic as it gets!  The restaurant is located off the main Las Vegas strip in a small strip mall.  The restaurant offers Taiwanese and Mainland Chinese food.

My table mates were very safe with their food offerings, but I threw in a couple of my favorites.  To start, we had the Mongolian Beef.  I didn't order this, but I'm glad that someone did.  The dish was created with very tender and flavorful beef sauteed with white onions, green onions, and a hint of garlic.  The flavor was outstanding, and I think this was the best Mongolian Beef that I've ever had!   Grade:  A!

The second dish was the restaurant favorite, Xiao Long Bao (XLB).  The XLB came out 8 to a serving and was served piping hot.  Each dumpling has a bit of juice in it and it had very strong flavors of ginger.  Delicious and fun to eat.  Grade:  B

The third dish was basil chicken.  Served in a little pot with a gel flame to heat the dish, the chicken was cooked with a soy glaze and heavy hints of basil.  I again didn't order this, but glad that someone did.  The flavors were bold and strong.  Grade:  A-

The fourth dish was stir fried green beans.  Typical string beans sauteed with green onions, garlic, and dried shrimp.  It was delicious!   They added additional flavors in this dish that made it taste more savory than the typical way it is presented in other restaurants.  Grade:  B+

The fifth dish was the spicy fish hot pot.  This dish can be ordered as non-hot or as bit arsh hot that you can stand it.  We ordered the dish as spicy.  The fish was generous, delicious and hearty.  There was cabbage (napa cabbage) below the fish.  The soup was presented in a soup-oil broth complete with spicy red peppers!  One thing that I missed about this dish was that it didn't have the typical szchuan peppercorns that numb the tongue.   The dish was spicy, but it didn't have the depth that it normally has with the peppercorns.  Grade:  B+

Service was great!  There was two main waitresses that worked the 20+ tables.  The younger of the two (daughter?) was very pleasant and allowed me to practice my Chop Suey Chinglish (I tried to speak Taiwanese / Mandarin / Cantonese all at once).  She understood me 100% and I had a good laugh!  The older waitress was a bit more serious!

This is a great place ot take family and/or friends.  They have an extensive menu of items (7+ pages of dishes!).

It's always hard for me to find a place that can make dan dan noodles just right and this place is always spot on! I usually don't go during rush hour but when I do go, the staff is always courteous and attentive. The fact that the staff is also all Chinese and joke and speak Chinese really makes this place feel like home (: every time a friend a craving Chinese food, I always recommend this place first!",5

735660,CeQisMQLelNsidEpDxWjsg,NhpdNYXoRofaa649drCz3g,"On my last visit to Las Vegas, I treated my parents to early dinner at China Mama's, based specifically on the reviews on this site. I am always a sucker for great reviews, and certainly appreciate the candor of peoples reviews.

I have to say that after having visited China Mama's, I now have found my 'go to' Chinese restaurant everytime I visit Las Vegas. Having been to some of the best Chinese restaurants in San Francisco and NYC, I wouldn't say I am an expert on Chinese cuisine, but will say that I've tasted some wonderful dishes from coast to coast, and what China Mama offers, is almost up there with the finest of the aforementioned cities. 

As a rule of thumb, whenever I visit a restaurant for the first time, I always chose the 'safe' dishes-- In other words, what you would consider to be the main/staple dishes of the restaurants cuisine. This time around, at China Mama's, I decided to order myself the Shrimp Chow Men with the thick home-made noodles and Sweet & Sour Chicken. My parents ordered themselves the Combination Chow Men with the regular noodles and some Won Ton Soup. 

I'm assuming the Won Ton soup is already made in a pot they keep warmed up throughout the day, because no later than 10 minutes after we ordered the waitress brought it in a large serving bowl, with small bowls for everyone at our table. I'm not really a fan of Won Ton Soup, but the waitress encouraged me to try it out. I am glad she did. Add some of their home made hot sauce and you have got a super delicious mixture. I wasn't really trying to eat much of it due to it being 110 degrees out, but I have to say, it was extremely tasteful and the flavoring just perfect. As far as the actual Won Tons, at least to me, I didn't find much taste to them. But the flavorful soup more than made up for that.

My parents and I were thoroughly impressed at the serving size of our dishes, once the chow meins and sweet and sour chicken came out. Being our first time at this place, we all piggy-backed off each others plates to savor everything we all had ordered. It was far too much food, though. Despite there being three of us, we pretty much had at least 1/3rd of each dish as left overs. Which was great as we got to-go boxes and were able to enjoy the rest back at our strip hotel.

Having thoroughly enjoyed our dinner, I will certainly be back to China Mama's my next trip to Vegas and plan on going deeper into their menu to explore other dishes. Good looking out fellow Yelpers!",4
735661,gSk2zeLCjDGDb4ovrB2okg,NhpdNYXoRofaa649drCz3g,I've been coming here for years. Service is great for both pick-up orders and dine-in. The sizzling seafood soup broth is delicious!,4
735662,_Ba75KrAk4mYLYaWhhoFeA,NhpdNYXoRofaa649drCz3g,"Las Vegas is known for the many restaurants owned by famous chefs such as Bobby Flay and Gordon Ramsay but my most recent trip to Las Vegas and California was about discovering Taiwanese food. We had driven past China Mama and I remember thinking that it was a bit of a hokey name and that I probably wouldn't try it based on that. To my surprise, a few days later my sister said that she was going to take me to China Mama for Dandan Noodles. 
China Mama is in what is considered Chinatown and is a typical Chinese restaurant. There are mainly rectangular tables for 4 and a few round tables to seat larger groups.  The decor is simple. As you walk in the wall at the entrance is full of plaques with reviews and awards won. There are a few chairs at the entrance for a very small waiting area but we were there on a week day for lunch and were seated immediately with no wait time. You can peek into the kitchen as you make your way to the tables and there is some food housed in the refrigerated glass case just outside the kitchen area. 
China Mama's menu consists of noodles, rice, pastry and a la carte dishes. Noodles were a selection of chow mein, noodles with soup and some not so common items such as Dandan noodles and cold noodles with shredded chicken. The pastry section does not exactly contain what North Americans will call pastry. There is a selection of bread (Chinese style) stuffed with vegetables and or meat; familiar dumplings (boiled or pan fried and won tons and Chinese style pancake. Pancake is dough pan fried. The sweet variety has a layer of bean paste in the middle.
The rice dishes are pretty familiar fried rice with different meat and vegetables and the a la carte menu seemed fairly standard aside from offering frog legs. I have to confess I didn't take a thorough look through that section. We ordered Dandan Noodles, Crispy layered pancake, Mama's special pan-fried chive buns, and pork stuffed pocket bread. 
The crispy layered pancake arrived and I'm not sure what we expected but it was a surprise, it was strands of dough placed in a circle and then pan fried till crispy. Our waiter must have known we didn't know what to do with it so took the time to explain that this dish would be ordered instead of rice to eat with other more savoury dishes. As dessert, the pancake would be sprinkled with sugar. He brought us some sugar so that we could try it as a dessert as well as a savoury. The bread is pretty plain but was excellent dipped in some hot chilli oil or as he suggested sprinkled with sugar. It reminded me a little of East Indian paratha but crispier. It was good dipped in the extra sauce from the Dandan noodles (sans sugar of course).
The Dandan noodles arrived in a huge bowl and the waitress came and mixed it all up for us. There was more than enough for two or three people especially when you are ordering other dishes as well. The pork stuffed pockets are a definite must try if you go. Minced pork with Chinese parsley and seasoning stir-fried and then put into pockets of bread which are then pan fried so that the bread is crisp on the outside. It is the same dough as the layered pancake. The chive buns are a little greasy on the outside but look like steamed buns filled with chives and scrambled eggs and then pan fried to crisp up the bottoms of the buns. The photo shows the dish as it first arrived and then there is another photo of the individual bun. The filling of the chive buns were a little on the bland side but we decided that it would go well with the leftover BBQ Roast duck we had at home and they did. The Dandan noodles were al dente with a thick flavourful sauce. There was more than sufficient sauce for the noodles; in fact we were able to boil up some noodles at home to add to our leftover dandan noodles and sauce for a full meal the next day. I'm definitely going back the next time I'm in Las Vegas.
Prices are extremely reasonable and wait staff efficient, friendly, and helpful.",4

The beef stew noodle soup is really good, you could choose thick or thin or cats ear type noodles, but we chose the traditional one--- it came in a huge serving bowl, which is great for sharing, the beef cuts  are very tender and flavorful.  I also agree with the other yelpers that the beef roll is 'must try'. 

The only minor thing I don't like is the  jasmine green tea they served--- the jasmine was overpowering for my taste and felt that I'm drinking soap tea, but my daughter likes it. 
Service is fast and efficient. We also came about 3 PM and the place wasn't so busy at about this time. Worth giving the place another try.",4

Dont know what's wrong with them. They're getting more rude as time goes on. Today we took our 80yr old farther here for early dinner. Told one of the  waitress (who has been working there at least 5 or 6 years) that it seemd very cold at this table since we have elders with us & if we can switch to another table that the air wont blow directly on us,  she raised her voice and said all restaurants in this country are the same, she also said bring extra clothes next time when u r coming here.",1

We had a few other things that were pretty tasty too but what I mentioned stood out the most. I was very impressed with this little place and is by far one of my favorite Chinese places that I've been to so far. I like that they serve jasmine tea it's different from the typical green tea that is served most places. The portions are pretty large so it is great for sharing.

Technically located on Jones, but just steps from Spring Mountain, China Mama had long been on my 'must visit' list thanks, in part, to strong reviews from several palates I trust.  Every bit an unassuming space, a veritable 'hut' in the lot adjacent Chada Thai, it was on entry that friends were located at a nearby table and with the extensive menu quickly perused under the watchful eye of a server who seemed intent on making sure there was never a moment of pause throughout our 70-minute stay an order was placed - the seven item onslaught soon to begin as the table filled quickly with far too much food for any three people to eat.

Beginning with items from the oft-raved ""pastry"" section before progressing to selections delineated by the origin of their protein, the meal began with Mama's signature Beef Roll and with the pan-kissed noodles stuffed thick with supple beef and light scallions both flavors and textures popped, a similar compliment due to the unctuous  pancake - the poignant flavor profile bolstered by a side of thick hoisin-like sauce that paired beautifully both here and with plate of intensely smoky bone-in duck.

Delving next into a steamer of XLB that was a bit light in soup despite excellent sapor from a ball of briny pork it was onward to walnut shrimp that our meal progressed and although occasionally overwhelmed by mayonnaise this version was perhaps the most impressive of the afternoon, a large portion of crisp and sweet crustaceans more than justifying the $18.95 menu price that proved on par with those at Blossom for best I've tasted in Las Vegas to date.

More than sated at this point it was almost comical just how large Mama's Special Pan Fried Pork Buns turned out to be, and although some were regrettably packed up as leftovers due to a frank lack of capacity the crispy exterior yielding a pocket of seared pork amidst rich aromatics still enticed me enough to eat three, a steamer of red bean buns intended as 'dessert' picked at simultaneously with subtle sweetness proving an excellent juxtaposition to the brine of the pork while the creamy filling was forgivingly light at the end of a rather substantial meal.

No different than many of the eateries surrounding Spring Mountain in terms of scene and service but excelling with regard to the food China Mama is every bit worthy the high praise it has received from persons both local and distant.  Admittedly a bit more expensive than Cathay House or Chang's but far superior to the former and without the dim-sum service issues of the later a large-group exploration of a more extensive swath of the menu seems pertinent.",4

The cons:
-  I hail from LA so the prices were a bit steep for this variety of Chinese cuisine.  Nonetheless, enjoyed my time here.

As a group of 6, my friend and I went to this restaurant for dinner.
After we sit, one of the waiter was pushing the cart through, and almost hit my friend, and stained her new coat with the grease from unwashed dishes. My friend was suggesting them to be careful, and the waiter was quite impatient and said "" such a trivial thing"". He was totally disrespectful, and rude to us.

My wife came in later and try to pull a chair to sit, and another waitress throw her a comment saying "" you can sit on two chairs"", implying that she is over-weighted. 
We were shocked and did not order dinner there and left.

Staining a customer's coat might be trivial to the restaurant, but it is never trivial and pleasant for anyone to see the grease and stain all over his/her newly bought down coat of $200.
The discriminating language used against my wife is absolutely insulting, and even hostile.

They do this to try to cover up a sewage smell coming from the restrooms but instead now smells like sewage and bathroom perfume mixed together. We decide to stay but try to get a seat in the back of the restaurant to avoid the smell. They had just opened so it was not busy at all but the two waitresses totally ignored us as we waited to be seated. I walk towards the back of the restaurant to get the waitresses attention when she starts just yelling and pointing ""you no sit yourself, you go back there and wait.""

This place also delivers which is amazing at a charge of two bucks. 

The only reason for four stars is because the food here can sometimes be slightly oily at times.",4

I would rather go to Panda Express or China Go Go since the food is better and cheaper. The food didn't have much taste and very greasy. My wife and I ate there and then both got horrible gut rot all night. Yeah, it's one of those kind of places. Have not plans of going back there.",2

Their food is good - not the best ever but consistently good. The lunch specials are a great deal. The portions are huge for the price and they are fast and friendly.

Portions size great for the price.  Service was good and the place was clean.

We ordered Walnut Shrimp which I expected to only have about 12 shrimps inside.  I was wrong. Fried and coated perfectly!
Salt and Pepper Shrimp again more than the expected 12 shrimps in the order.  Good seasoning and just the right amount of heat.
Mongolian Beef was average but good.
Corn Egg Flower Soup was perfect for my hangover!!
Crab Rangoons had too much cream cheese.  I would have liked more crab inside.
Mango and Honeydew Boba was refreshing but the boba seemed over cooked.

Mabo tofu, honey walnut shrimp, Mongolian beef, wor wonton soup, & the salt and pepper squid are my favorites from this place. They give a huge portion. I can never finish in one sitting and they give plenty of rice.

We are new to this side of town, and tonight we were at our new house painting - none of our dishes are here yet so we figured why not get Chinese? So we ordered from Bobo - Mongolian beef with fried rice, 2 egg rolls and a wonton soup. 
It came in about 40 minutes (a little slow, but the delivery guy was nice). When I opened the package up I was disappointed to find no spoon - I have no dishes so I can't eat my wonton soup. However, after looking at it, I didnt want to eat it anyway...it was super oily and had some kind of gross bright purple mystery meat in it (pork? Chicken? Something more sinister? Honestly I couldn't tell). My boyfriends Mongolian beef was okay, although not at all spicy like I had ordered. Fried rice was greasy and bland at best. 
Sorry Bobo, you won't be our new Chinese takeout place :-(",2

My co-workers don't have the greatest taste in food and I was walking in blind (hadn't checked the Yelp). It looks a bit sketchy from the outside, but usually the hole in the walls are decent. So in I walked while quickly scanning reviews.

It's located on Sahara in the Smart & Final shopping center a couple businesses down from the Biscuits Café. 

One of my co-workers has been frequenting this joint for 6 years is what I've been told. So the nice lady did not bother to give her a menu because she was getting the usual. I quickly scanned until I found the lunch specials. Lunch specials include your entrée choice, soup, low mein and fried or steamed rice. I decided to go with the Cashew nuts chicken and steamed rice. She provided us with a Styrofoam cup of arrowhead water that she kept cold and full the entire time. I wasn't totally keeping track, but the soup came first only about 2-5 minutes after taking our order and the food followed maybe 5-10 minutes after the soup. Food was extremely hot and totally delicious. I actually had to let it cool off before I stuffed my face. The one thing that stuck out the most for me was the chicken. It wasn't chewy and rubbery like I normally find while eating Chinese food. There was plenty of food in each portion, so much that I couldn't finish mine completely. 

There was nothing negative about my visit. Fast, friendly and good food! I'm looking forward to trying it again!",5
752665,YWtzmimv3NjY_fNqNWoHng,Xo9a2Vm83Fao6MpprxWcKw,"One of those days when takeout Chinese and the TV are all you can handle?
Come here and place your order, while you wait you get a complimentary bowl of egg drop soup, then it's back home to your sweatpants and Netflix. You know what I'm talking about.

Best option is the lemon chicken- it's like the chinese food version of junk food, but the version here has two gigantic servings of chicken and is practically swimming in a generous amount of the perfectly sweet lemon sauce. Mad cheap with a side of rice for like $8.

If you're going the healthy route, the shrimp and vegetable stir fry with brown rice is also a good option- lots of snap peas, broccoli, carrots, and celery in a flavorful sauce with several shrimp. Combo also comes with an eggroll, rangoon, and a fried shrimp, also for $8.

Order both and add in a Big-Gulp-sized Thai tea and a tip for a date night around $20.

I didn't have a single dish that I would consider good and I tried fried rice, lo mein, mapo tofu, beef w/ broccoli, a spicy chicken dish, some pork dishes, steamed dumplings, egg rolls, crab rangoon and pretty much every dish except the mixed seafood one.   Even the steamed rice and basic things like wonton & hot and sour soup were not very good either. Panda Express is a lot better than this place. For the same price as this buffet, you can go eat at Ping Pang Pong which is the best Chinese food in town. Don't waste your time.",1

The food is good, always the same quality--between good and great, never something amazing. Service is good and recently they've been opening a little earlier than 11. Sushi is decent, never got problems with it. 

One star off for the food and service just being good, not spectacular.
Another star off for lacking in some areas. Deserts and fruits are their weak points--and I love deserts! 

Go here if you just want a no BS asian buffet. Good all around, but not great at anything.

EDIT: I've been here for dinner. Not exactly worth the extra $$$ for the dinner service, but they do have different dishes. The coconut chicken (which is the ""leftovers"" bits of the chicken (skin, tendons, scraps) at lunch) turns to coconut shrimp, they add in some seafood, and the choppy tri-tip mix.",3

I get there and its an Asian/Chinese buffet. Not impressed. Even the decor was non descript. I was dreading eating there but I did it for my aunt. Pleasantly surprised, the food was actually OK. Nothing special but there's the standard fare. I was surprised there was honey shrimp, crabs, and prawns as the higher cost items. Service was fine. 

Mostly locals eating here. The best thing about this place that bumped it to 3 stars is the just under $13 price tag for dinner. I am not sure how they make money.

Not worth the drive but if you're in the area (maybe to visit the ridiculous number of car dealerships) then hit this place up.",3

Any buffet with crab legs is a winner in my book, but for some reason the crab legs here were a little skimpy on the meat =( I shouldn't work so hard to crack open a leg to find NO MEAT inside. 

Anyways.. They offer other variety of foods here from sushi to french fries and wonton soup. They serve fruits here along with ice cream, but I did find the ice cream to taste a bit strange.

If you enjoy Buffet @ Asia then you'll probably like this place as well since they both are pretty much tied in my book.",3

The food wasn't bad at all. There were certain items that I had to pack my plate up with since they were my favorites! 

The place was bustling and packed on a Saturday evening at around 8:30pm - but we didn't have to wait, we were quickly seated at a booth when we walked in. The food kept being refreshed since there were a lot of diners- this is a great thing! 

They have a decent selection of Chinese goodies and other asian flavors. 

I ended up with a plate stacked with cream cheese wontons and gyoza...Somehow it seemed like the right thing to do. They were so crispy and gushing with cream cheese goodness. So bad yet sooo sooo good! They make them very good here. 

Plus their sweet and sour sauce and gyoza sauce sealed the deal! I'm a saucy girl, and I dunked my gyoza and wontons like there was no tomorrow. Super yummy! 

They had oysters on a half shell that were cleanly shucked, tasted sweet, and didn't get us sick after eating... That's a huge plus in the books! 

The crab legs and butter with lemon was a hit for me! (Only served at dinner) 

The vanilla soft serve was creamy, sweet and a perfect ender to the gorge fest! 

Here is a list of everything that I could remember from the buffet: (trust me, there was a ton more) 
Frog legs
Oysters
Fried chicken

I don't think the use much if any MSG. The steamed fish, stir-fried clams and the spinach dishes are always my go-to. Everything else is pretty good but these 3 are best. For quick Asian food fix, this beats Panda or take-out shops any day. 

Him: The fish here is amazing. The flavor is nice and light and it breaks easily when you eat it. It feels like it flakes apart. You don't have to really bite it. They have good sushi too. It's not like other sushi restaurants, but it's still just good. I like the noodles too. It tastes like the Chinese noodles I like with extra onions which means extra-flavor. Only go for lunch. Don't go for dinner like other people do who just go for the crab. I like crab but they have skinny snow crab and it's too weird because it doesn't have much flavor or meat like Dungeness crabs.

759843,Ta7OKtRlAroC_qVmMJewMQ,5YgXxBUzhf3qh8F8wYSqsA,"Decent buffet- it's not on the Strip, so don't expect five star quality, but it's a decent option for a large selection that isn't packed with mediocre dishes of low quality.

Sushi selection is large- about 8 different rolls with at least one vegetarian and one fried option, but most are variations of Philadelphia and California rolls. Primary fish used are crab and spicy tuna, lots of avocado in use here but in one roll it had more of a guacamole flavor to it. Not the best quality fish, but large selection for a price under what you'd usually spend on a single roll at an actual sushi restaurant.

Soups are fresh, won ton was good but broth was a bit too oily for my liking. Fish used in cooked dishes (baked salmon, grilled seabass, seafood delight) was underseasoned and over cooked.

Other items were decent: salad bar and dessert area had the usual choices, plus an octopus salad that had way too much jalapeno for my liking. Chicken wings were fried but tasted fresh. Chinese options weren't overly Americanized or greasy: beef and broccoli, a sad-looking lo mein, several tofu options.

Well, my mother and I are huge fans of cheap buffets with great food and especially seafood! This place was about 25-30 minutes away from home, but we don't mind the drive if we get to try something new.

When we came in (around 630pm) it was pretty busy, but we were seated as soon as we came in, which was awesome that we didn't have to wait. There's people that complain about how old the place looks and the seating but I didn't mind it at all. That's actually not something I really care for anyway when I go to eat somewhere.

They had a WIDE variety of food. Sooooooo much. I don't think I can eat for another two days! Their crab was delicious especially with the hot butter. They are SMALLER crablegs than what you'll get paying $20 bucks at a casino buffet but it's all you can eat so what does it matter? It was hot, delicious and sooo worth the $12.49.

They had so many different foods to choose from and it was of good quality. I'm not a massively picky eater but I can be and I really enjoyed eating here.

Plus the only meat I eat are seafood and very picky with it so we like that this place always has something for me (crabs and some shrimp) instead of going else where paying a fortune and I don't touch much of the other entrees. But really this place is CHEAP! The service is good. There are a couple of gals that we really like having as servers, one of them is Jenny. They refill drinks and check back on your mess and empty plate constantly, the guys not so much you have to flag them just to get a refill. Also don't hesitate to ask for extra crackers since they only give one per table but they are whiling to give you more if you just ask. We took my dad here this past Sunday for dinner. He was amazed how cheap the price was and pointed that they were A LOT cleaner that the other asian buffet in town (Asian Buffet - which we really dislike) that his friend took him too not long ago.
We were talking about how cheap the cost of the dine was and how worth it it was but did notice how other table around us didn't seemed like they tipped much at all and some at all. We weren't trying to look and talk about how much other people tipped and what not we just individually noticed how cheap their customers can be. Food was CHEAP, quality was...chinese food and service was decent and we felt really bad. We follow our standard of doubling tax for a basic eh, so so service and triple for a good service. But not tipping is just plain RUDE. Don't eat out if you *won't tip. Its Vegas people! Yes, it is their jobs but these employee gets paid minimum if not just a bit higher than minimum due to the fact that they depend on tips who also have families depending on them.
We get it the service was bad and not tipping can probably justify that but like said servers are good its a buffet do you really expect your servers to chat with you?
We feel bad for their servers I hope their hourly are higher than we believe they get.",4

I was very disappointed and even thought the lunch buffet was $8.99 it wasn't worth it for what we ate! Gross & will never be back!,1

Still lots of choices--potstickers, chow mein, fried rice, sushi, all the requisite Asian items, plus pizza and french fries. Desserts aren't too exciting, but I like the fried donuts. And there's always the fresh fruit. The service is good--your used first plate is magically gone before you get back with the second! For me, the variety is the draw so I give it four or four and a half stars.",4

So I haven't forgotten how good it is.  My friend also wanted to try because he heard rumors about this place.  I must say I was a little disappointed because they used to have anime scrolls on the walls and different anime series.  So I miss seeing them on the wall.  I wonder why they took them off the wall?!?!?  Hmm.....  Anyways, past is the past and it's time to move on.  Their sushi is the bomb.   They have more variety of sushi then any other asian 
buffets I went too.  Customer service is excellent.   They always make sure your drinks are always filled.  Your never going to be left thirsty. I'm definitely going to come back here again.",4
759855,oRrVfaSWZw5xCp6FjO3UUA,5YgXxBUzhf3qh8F8wYSqsA,"I've eaten here quite a few times, including today. Mostly for lunch. To me, this place is one of those places where you can expect good food for a cheap price. This place definitely delivers that much.

For $8.29, the food is pretty good. You have your Chinese-American regulars, such as orange chicken, wonton soup, dumplings, fried rice, chow mein, etc. But you also have steamed fish, pork ribs, clams, vegetable tempura, Americanized sushi, and... *trumpet sounds* a soft serve ice cream machine.

They have a pretty good assortment of food choices. I personally prefer to get a cheap Chinese chicken wing craving fulfilled here during lunch. Plus, their apple strudel dessert is one of my personal favorites. For those with kids, don't fret, because they have french fries and pizza for them little picky eaters.

A positive thing to note is that they have salt & pepper shrimp WITH the head and legs on. You can eat the whole thing. And I just love that salt & pepper taste.

The restaurant interior is nice, but it reminds me of when I used to live in less-than-ideal areas. The seats are kind of sticky and graffiti in the restroom is noticeable. However, I don't really mind since I know I'm getting a decent meal at a very affordable price.

Overall, this place is one of my go-to spot for a cheap lunch. All of the food here is pretty good and you won't break the bank eating here.

PS. You can print out a coupon from their website, ranging from 10-15% off, depending when you use it.",4
759856,30HzbELTQ2HkPSTb1XgVhw,5YgXxBUzhf3qh8F8wYSqsA,"I like this place a lot. It's not bad but I like to go on Sundays because of their oysters. Surprisingly, they are fresh and juicy just like any oyster bar out there or even better but this one is steal deal. Not fancy, just casual. They do have limited food but I'm okay with it. 
They also have fresh sashimi at their sushi stations. Again, limited rolls but I truly understand. 
Just a big boo hoo on their dessert. My only favorite was their cream puffs, which was seriously filled up with cream.",4
759857,so5tRFThFOM9c1Ld6l0y6g,5YgXxBUzhf3qh8F8wYSqsA,"It's decent. My go-to place whenever I feel like pigging out. 

I've been here so many times I can tell you what they are serving for lunch and dinner.

It's the same thing every day. 

My only complain is sometimes the place gets too busy and it gets dirty. One place, our table smelled like fish and I completely lost my appetite. 

Also, the servers get so occupied, they can't really refill my water and give me enough tissue LOL gets me frustrated and wonder why they can't just give it us as soon as we are seated. No one really survives a buffet with one anyways.",3
759858,vgK6b3hdr7jKLI4COMTsYg,5YgXxBUzhf3qh8F8wYSqsA,"This is honestly not a bad deal at all for an $12.99 AYCE.  For that price, you get crab legs, crawfish, shrimp, clams, mussels, and probably 40 other dishes that are all decent to quite good.  Plus, you can use the coupon for $5 off the bill!  Only exception was the sushi section where I thought the nigiri were not quite up-to-par.  Service was typically stiff but very timely.

Here's what I liked:
- Crab legs were great, and unlike most places not salty at all.  Only if I saw that giant pot of melted butter earlier...
- Seasoned crabs also, which I did not have but mum said was good
- Raw oysters!!!!
- Crawfish was yummy, they put some type of seasoning on it that was great.  As with any steamed crawfish, it's a pain-in-the-ass to eat though.
- Mussels in the mayo-based sauce was great, mussels were plump
- Clam in some type of garlic(?) sauce was also great
- 4 types of soups - miso, wonton, hot & sour, and egg drop were good
- Several flavors of ice cream
- Fried bananas were awesome!
- Mandarin orange - the canned kind, but I love those
- The apple strudel-looking thing looked really good, but did not have room in my tummy
 
Didn't like so much:
- As mentioned above, stay away from the sushi
- Desserts were not great.  I had the cream puffs and they were awful.
- Fried rice tasted like the ones at fast food places, not Chinese restaurants
- Overall Chinese dishes didn't look impressive
 
With at least twice as many good as the bad, and with the goods being so much bigger in stature, this place gets big ups.  4-star food, not quite, but 4-star deal, it is.

I am not a huge fan of buffet settings, because to me, the items are usually added on to the old items sitting there for god knows how long!

The Krazy buffet on the other hand was delicious. They had a nice unique variety of flavorful dishes to choose from for $10 per person.  Probably the best $10 i have ever spent at a restaurant.  Their items were fresh and and the customer service was great! (5 stars) 

I discovered this place across the street from my place of work and tried it out with a few co-workers.  They had a pretty decent self serve sushi bar.  Seafood was fresh and that is all that really matters to me when it comes to sushi.  

Let's just say i liked this place so much that i wanted to make sure they were consistent with their food service.  They are consistent every time!

For dinner, which starts at 4pm, they add crab legs & oysters... Just be sure to bring your patience with you because some of the servers dont understand english, are kinda rude, and it gets so packed with people who bring their little kids, and let them run around unattended while yelling and screaming, as if the buffet was a personal playground.

But the real downer for this place is the service. It's abominable. They refused to honor the child's price for my 11-year-old, though the signage clearly states that kids 12 and under ate a lower price. The entire staff wasn't just careless or disengaged, they were downright hostile. I can't understand why anyone would come back here if they are always like this.

I noticed that Dragon Wok was in the area.  I decided to stop in and was greeted or should I say ignored by one rude young lady.  

I ordered General Chicken with Chow Mein and it was actually not bad.  The Chicken had what we call fillers, meaning, celery and carrots, but usually other places stop there, this had some broccoli, onions and bell peppers, this was a surprise.  I like how they added the extra stuff instead of just celery to add to the meal.

The meal came with soup and I got a kick out of how the lady walked up to me after I sat down and barked, ""Do you need soup?"" Well I don't need soup but I would like what I paid for!

There are a few things that I feel you must have like chicken fried rice, garlic butter and a really good soup and salad. The salad was good, not great but good. It was kind of like a 1000 island - ginger dressing that we all ate. I notice that everyone at our table kind of passed on the soup. At first I thought I was the only one but literally everyone took a bite or two and pushed it away. I was disappointed with the fried rice. When you compare it to other restaurants it was very plain. Lots of white rice that did not get blended with the soy sauce and butter. Again, it wasn't very good. The service from the staff was great, the chef was very friendly but I think the menu needs an overhaul.",4

The second thing you need to know is that they charge almost $4 for fried rice.  Not a huge dish of fried rice, a little bowl of fried rice.  Most other teppan yaki placed in town include it!  Well at least the good ones do.  The shrimp was not very good and the filet wasn't cooked well.  I ordered medium and it came out medium rare, and it wasn't really seared, more steamed.  You know how steamed steak tastes?  Well that was it.  The chicken was pretty good, but maybe on the dry side.  The ginger sauce was probably the best of all of the components.  Seriously, forego this place and try a local one instead.  For my money, Geisha on Sandhill and DI is far superior.  They give you fried rice as well as soup, salad, and an appetizer, I usually get the shrimp and vegetable tempura, and your choice of soda or small sake if you order the Geisha Special, and it's either $35.95 or 37.95.  The Geisha Special includes a shrimp appetizer, usually three pieces and then chicken, steak, and lobster.

At Lillie's, I got the special, can't remember the name, and it came with chicken, shrimp, and filet, it's a choose three situation, or you can get lobster and two others.  If you want really good teppan yaki and really want good value for your money, Geisha at DI and Sandhill is the way to go!

Come to think of it, the 2 stars here might be a bit generous.

The waitstaff was not that attentive, drinks ran empty a few times, they crowded us in at the table by maybe an extra person or two, they let people smoke e-digs, so for you, maybe that's a plus, but that shit stinks.

The new york steak was flavorless and very fatty.  The chef was almost comatose and barely going thru the motions.  The onions were still raw when served and the shrimp left a lot to be desired.

Ambience:  Nice decor, kind of a modern asian theme.  I would say more on the casual dining side then fine dining.  Pretty quiet at 11:30am
Service:  There were a lot of servers (ratio was probably 2:1 servers to customers) so there was never a problem to get anything.  Food came out at a decent pace.  Check came out fast when requested.
Food:  I had the beef congee (porridge) and I thought it was good.  It was very simple and I added a touch of soy sauce to it.  The beef were small chunks but soft and delicate.  I would definitely get the dish again.  My friend thought the pho was ok (filet). I ordered the appetizer sampler (2 potstickers, 2 egg rolls, 2 shrimp tempura, 2 pork dumpling).  Each item came with its own recommended dipping sauce.  The dumpling and potstickers were both very good.  I also had the Vietnamese ice coffee.  You can't really go wrong with that.  
Value:  I must warn you that this place is pretty darn pricey.  The appetizers were over $17 for literally 8 pieces.  The pho was over $16.  I guess its a Palazzo thing...

There is no music what soever and you can totally here everyones conversation from across the entire restaurant. I went with a group of six on a friday at 8pm and you would of thought that there was some sort of seniors only early bird special going on.

We came here on a Saturday at 11:30 a.m. after a night of partying and noodle soup was a must. The place was pretty empty so we were seated right away. We ordered wonton noodle soup, pho tai (comes with filet mignon), and shanghai curry noodles. The broths for the wonton noodle soup and pho were light and seasoned just right. Both dishes also came with a ton of noodles. The shanghai curry noodles were my favorite. You could smell the freshness of the curry and the noodle was not too oily. Service was also on point.

For not wanting to drive off the strip for noodles, this place was great. The only downside are the prices. $18 for pho??? Way overpriced.",3

The remaining items are large family style dishes. They are pretty good but definitely over priced. For two of us with appetizers and entrees it was $150 with tip. Honestly I did not feel that the food was much better than PF Changs or other similar chain restaurant.  However, the service was excellent and our waiter was friendly, helpful and quick.",3

We hadden ook de rijst met pekingeend besteld. Je zou verwachten dat in zo'n chique restaurant de eend op z'n minst een filet is maar neen er zaten allemaal hele kleine stukjes bot in. Je kon niet anders dan met je handen de stukjes af te knabbelen om vervolgens de kleine stukjes terug uit je mond te moeten vissen. 
Eerlijk gezegd is een simpele Panda Express minstens even lekker en véél goedkoper. 
Positief puntje : gezellig interieur.",1
772368,-tUOZK4Qnn_146LsPThm2A,js12Ev8XKlh36gZeGHzQnA,"Note to self: NEVER dine out without first checking Yelp. I had done my research before going to Vegas, but since I was with my daughter and I like to have flexible days, I didn't want every meal planned out and reserved. So we hit a few places based on proximity, hunger factor, and what sounded good. This was one of those MISSES.

Our hotel room TV made Zine sound so fabulous. They really played up the black pepper beef, so that's what I was craving. And my daughter and I love dim sum, so they drew us in with that as well.

Well, there is no dim sum. They've got appetizers that you would see on any Asian restaurant menu. Period. Dim sum? Not really. Ambience was really nice. Service was really good. Food was MEH and it was outrageously expensive. Our meal was $104 and we had no alcohol and we didn't even eat the $30 plate of Walnut Shrimp. Yes, $30 for what you get at any Chinese place. Only this wasn't good and my daughter ate one shrimp and then pushed the plate aside. They really should have comped us.

The black pepper beef, I will grant them, was super tender. But it was flavorless. Literally. And it was $32!

We also shared pot stickers (standard) and Vietnamese Egg Rolls that came with a clear sauce that we couldn't figure out if there was any flavor at all. It definitely wasn't fish sauce. I love fish sauce. These rolls were really bland.

So Let Me Repeat: If you want to throw away your money on bland, overpriced food, this is your place. If you want better food, go to McDonalds. If you want to spend your money on fabulous food, go to Gordon Ramsay Steak or Raku. Those were my two planned dining experiences and they did not fail me.",2

The ceiling has lanterns hanging from the ceiling with a soft red lighting. The servers were very quick.  
We ordered a hot and sour soup which is okay. Just like any typical hot and sour soup at any Chinese place minus the price. 
Chilled jelly fish was missing sesame oil and a little more salt. It was so bland. Jelly fish is one of my top favorite things to eat too and it was a little disappointing how bland it was.
The soy marinated chicken was delicious!  But the portion sized was a little pricey for a quarter of a chicken leg. $16 to be exact!
The chicken feet I would say have to be one of the best dish I had there. The skin fell off the bone and it was so flavourful!  
Siu mai was good but not great. 
I will not be back but my experience was not unpleasant either. I'm just use to the more traditional Chinese cuisine.",3

Also the service flow was a little awkward, our appetizer order was taken before our drink order and then our main entree order wasn't taken until all the appetizers were served and almost finished.

I had the Kung Pao chicken which I had asked to be spicy and though it was delicious was blander than I would have liked. 
Service was fine. I believe there was a bit of a language challenge in that I asked for a couple of things that took two tries to get. I also had to flag them down once...so a bit more follow up would have been good.

The worst dish was the BBQ beef--very salty, rubbery, and greasy. They had a stir-fry of assorted vegetables that was an expensive letdown of salty, messy, and mushy broccoli, canned baby corn and mushrooms, zig-zag shaped carrots, and cabbage slathered in this salty, cum-cloudy, gelatinous sauce from Mars. Of course, the saving grace was the chicken katsu but I think that's hard to get wrong.",2

I cannot make the broth at home because it probably has at least 50 different spices (which makes it taste so awesome)! The portions of meat are great.

The hot pot was not to heavy but really delicious, warm, and just hardy enough. The warm moist food really helped clear my sinuses before another full night of partying from dusk till dawn. The delicious Vietnamese iced coffee gave me the perk I needed to really prepare myself for this last night in LV. The vanilla mochi for desert is a must have. Over all it was a casual, and satisfying experience. However, they made a mistake when splitting the check, and I ended up get charged once for the entire price then again for half the price...

The two plates were beef and fish balls with vegetables (enoki mushrooms, cabbage, tofu).  The spicy soup was delicious although it would have been even better if the spiciness was toned down just a tad.  The light plain soup base became flavorful once it was infused with the beef and vegetable flavors. The beef was fresh, and it was a good amount.

When we were trying to get seated, we didn't know where to sit and we asked the hostess in the front and she said in a rude way that we had to stand over there, where it wasn't even obvious. All there was, was a sign but no ropes to indicate there was a line up. That didn't exactly sit well with me before my meal began. I just thought of it as whatever since she wasn't going to be part of my eating experience and everything was going to get better. But it didn't get better...

We quickly got our drink orders, but it took the waiters more than 15 minutes to get our food orders. Nobody came to see us after our drinks got dropped off. I don't know why it took so long for them to see us but I was pretty impatient at that point and something dramatically good would have to happen for me to have a good time. Lucky me, it stayed the same.

I ordered their fried rice, pork belly, and their beef hot pot. For the price that you pay for the amount of food you get is most definitely not worth it. The food itself tasted alright, but not so delicious where they can skeet by with giving you the amount they did. The pork belly was fattier than I was expecting, and I already know pork belly is fat, but this pork must have not had any muscle. The fried rice was greasy. My plate was very oily after I finished my plate of rice and although it tasted good, it was probably far from good for me. When it was time to pay, the waiters disappeared again! Like yo, why do you guys disappear like that, it isn't cool! 

To say the least, I feel as though it is overpriced and the service was terrible. I wouldn't recommend going there. Chinatown is very nearby the Gold Coast, I would say go eat somewhere else in that area as opposed to here",2

It's like we were invisible.

We finally flagged down the busser to get the propane changed. Maybe the tip should go to the busser?

The waiters just walk around aimlessly. The hostess actually took our order. Majority of the time they walked out of the kitchen with out bringing anything out. Waiters at other restaurants actually work for their tip. These ones just don't care.

The hotpot is just mediocre compared to what you can get in L.A. I've seen way better hotpot at an average hotpot restaurant situated in a grocery store in Beijing.",1

The wonton soup was good with all the vegetables that was inside.  After we got done eating that.  The waiter gave us the rest of the food that we ordered.  The only thing wasn't satisfying was the BBQ chicken and roasted duck that was served cold.

It's not the nicest place, but for what we ordered it was good. I got walnut shrimp and wonton noodle soup. The shrimp was good and tasty. Crunchy where needed. The broth to the soup however had no taste and the noodles were kinda hard. My boyfriend ordered duck and basically ate the whole thing. He really liked it. It was good but I've tasted tastier duck at Sam Woo. The sweet and sour soup was just as named. And the crispy noodles were thin and crispy. 

The customer service was good. They were nice and accommodating and continuously cleaning our table off because we did order a lot and it got pretty messy. They were also filling up waters constantly so no problem there. 

Their bathrooms were okay. And there was a cart full of dirty dishes by our table, I wasn't so sure about that. But they did clean it out every so often. Didn't really bother us but I was just wondering if that was supposed to go there in the first place.

It was barely cooked, or deep fried enough at all. The ""HongKong Style Wonton Noodle"" soup had very little flavor. The noodles in the soup were a bit hard. The noodle soup also smelled of some sort of chemical, as if it were formaldehyde or something. I also did not receive the steamed rice that I was supposed to get with my order. I ordered my food to go. I don't live so close so it wasn't worth me returning back to the store. I ended up throwing it all out. A total waste of $17 and some change. I don't like to post bad reviews much, even when I receive bad service. I tend to focus on the positive, and try to give the benefit of the doubt. However, I couldn't help but post about my experience and the quality of the food. I'm still trying to get the horrific after taste out of my mouth, just from the little I tasted. I've been to many different Chinese and Asian restaurants around town, and I'm not the pickiest of eaters. This place has to be the very worst that I've ever come across.

But a good restaurant would always be consistent with their food items...therefore, I was utterly disappointed.  I was embarrassed that I took my husband here, and was his first time to dine in at this restaurant.

The service was quite decent for a Chinese restaurant though.  They served us a pot of tea, and offered free rice if we wanted it.  We politely decline the free of charge rice offering.

I was really afraid I was going to get sick  off this place. Thankfully I didn't get sick, but I definitely wasn't raving it was the best food either. 

I got a couple plates- chow mein, fried rice, chicken on a stick (i really dont know what it was called), a few other things... and everything was average. The sushi was better than grocery sushi, but still a largely noticeable difference to an actual sushi restaurant. Plus one of the rolls was warm when I bit into it, instant fear and regret set over me. I'd like to thank my stomach of steel for saving me from that one. I got a plate of crab legs, saying to my friend ""you can't screw up crab legs."" But I was wrong. Don't get me wrong, the taste was fine... but just about every other piece I cracked open didn't have any meat in it! Crab legs are not easy to open so I was definitely not happy about that. The best tasting thing I had was the baked bananas, those were delicious.

The dessert was average... below actually. I got this little cake with pink frosting on top. No real flavor to it. What I think was ambrosia... but it was nothing but marshmallows (isn't it supposed to have fruit?), and a soft serve. The texture was... off, but the taste was ok. 

We didn't have any problems with the service. The lady was nice and after getting our drinks pretty much left us alone. Considering it cost about $15 to eat here at dinner time, I won't be back. For $15 I could've got a MUCH better meal elsewhere and not had to fear for my life.",2

living in Vegas my whole life we have had a lot of Chinese food places come and but this place never fails to be fresh.

if you are into sushi they have an entire sushi bar and its very fresh and kept up to date they even have little stickers of when they were put out on the buffet so you can ensure that  it is not too old

they have an amazing selection of Mongolian barbeque and it's like a pic your own Chinese food and they cook it fresh for you it is to die for

this place is pretty big and seats a lot of people has a lot of traffic so very rarely do I see a wait but it is always packed and because it is always packed the food turnover is incredibly quick  very rarely have I seen dishes cold,  empty or close to empty usually its full fresh heaping piles of goodness that you can scoop on to your plate

they have fresh crawfish hot and cold they have a good soup selection and a great Chinese selection all the way from fried rice to want on soup too fried wontons to pot stickers to muscles to hot wings to pizza for the kids

it is definitely worth the price you will not regret going

My Mom likes this place mainly because she loves to save a dollar. It was Extremely busy. I think it was because Sunday is seafood night I suppose. There were 3 adults and a 3 yr old (who was charged half price). The total price was around $53.

Places like this is why I don't really care for buffets because of it's cattle like ambiance. Shoulder to shoulder waiting to be seating to engorge on mediocre food. Sign me up! I am a sushi addict and their sushi IS grocery store quality. Meaning it has been sitting around way ahead of time. Only difference is the grocery store usually doesn't have too much of a selection. But if stuffing your belly is the goal..who cares..right :P Nothing fresh about it..it has a nice selection though.

867886,ojMjGmnOEwtzplHpio1UBg,kALWQ76kSTrt_WhdjLAs3g,"Been here several times over the past couple years so I guess a review should be done. Like all other buffets, you pay one price and get going. Most places dont include a drink in the price but this place does so thats a plus.

I went for lunch ($9.95 total with tax) on a monday afternoon around 1:30. You would think the place would not be that busy but it was packed as usual. 

Like other visits in the past, their set up has not changed. You have 4 islands. One is usually designated the sushi bar (not very good imo). Another is the fruits/dessert bar (its ok). While the other two are main entrees like fried rice, soup, wings, beef ribs, steamed fish, fried squid, peppered beef, green beans, and pot stickers. These items mentioned are what I usually get because they are actually decent.

So the food quality is still the same. Not awesome by any means, but good enough for me to consume and be satisfied. Originally when I first tried these guys a couple years ago, the lunch price was only 7 bucks. My how times have changed. The dinner price is usually about 3 to 4 dollars more because they have crab legs.

Service is ok and it shouldnt be any worse. Heck, you are getting up to get your own food. All they need to do is get your drink and clean up your excess dishes. Nevertheless I still at least put down a dollar for tip as long as they are consistent.

The minus 2 stars are mainly for the price increase and the bathroom. Im sure they try to keep it clean but those idiot vandals always seem to write stuff on the walls, mirrors, sinks, etc with sharpies or with something actually sharp to engrave it. Sometimes I come in there to find that there is no more soap or paper towels. Also they will charge you if you get too much food and then dont eat much of it.

To put it in perspective, I will still come here occasionally just to switch things up a bit but due to the increasing prices, the timeframe in between each visit is gonna get longer and longer. As long as the masses keep coming here, they will continue to raise it until they notice attendance starts going down. Its all about supply and demand.

The food is always fresh and they serve huge meaty king crab legs and fried crabs too. The fried chicken wings tastes like you made them at home. There's a variety of vegetables and rice dishes the sweet plaintains are to die for. Dinner starts at 4 pm til 9 pm. There are fresh oysters and clams and sushi too. Non alcoholic drinks including Chi Tea are unlimited. Instead of ice cream you'll get more of a frozen dessert not milk based and a variety of fruits, jello, cakes and cookies and sesame seeded nuts. There's also a huge wok where you can pick your ingredients and they will cook it for you.

The staff is very friendly and they will pass by your table often to remove the plates.  Because I love seafood I go here often. It's very family friendly and usually the wait time is about three minutes. If you are arriving with a large party call ahead to reserve some tables. The decor is relaxed and comfortable booths or you can dine at the table with chairs if you choose. I prefer a booth because it gives us extra room for all of the yummy dishes we get. Asian ribs there are tasty just a bit too over cooked for me. In the back of the bufet they do offer peel and eat shrimp which sometimes can be on the pasty side. They also have delcious pepper shrimp which I love.

Pizza never has sauce it's mainly bread and cheese so I don't bother with it at all. I am not a frog leg eater. My family has said they are fried a bit hard for them. There's also baked Tilapia and Swai fish too which is delicious. The lunch isn't as great as the dinner because even though they have a good selection of the basic foods there's no seafood during lunch except fish.

Looked as if no one cleaned it for months! Also the sushi they served was very gross. Not fresh at all! Tasted like nasty gas station sushi with the rice all mushed together as of it was made from a machine.,1

Decent variety with all your standards and the Mongolian grill is always open if you want something super fresh. It's always pretty busy which means everything stays relatively fresh. This isn't the Baccahanal Buffet at Caesars but definitely my go to place if I'm having a hankering for a plate full of Americanized Chinese food.",4

The service, 4 stars - we had a very gracious and attentive server who allowed our party of 7 to split our bill without any hassle. 

The food is 3 star, on its own - definitely not bad tasting food, but realize that you'll be paying $16-$20+ for an entree that, for the exact same order, would run you $6-$8 in an off-strip restaurant. I'm okay occasionally paying more if I see an increase in quality; for Beijing Noodle, this is not the case. 

I had the Yangzhou Style Fried Rice (Shrimp, diced Ham, diced carrots, peas, $17) and the Singapore Style Rice Noodles (Shrimp, diced BBQ pork, scant bean sprouts, a few shreds of julienned bell pepper, $17). They were average, but edible, and on-table soy sauce and sambal oelek were welcome spices. 

The wait, 1 star - we stood in line for 40+ minutes on NYE, which I guess is standard (? - I don't think so...), but they also will move any VIP's to the front of the line, of which there were many the night we came, lengthening our total wait. 

The cross-contamination of food items, 1 star - beware that because they make wheat noodles fresh in house, it's almost impossible to avoid allergen contamination with non-wheat items. If you are gluten-free or gluten intolerant, you're gonna have a bad time, which I did less than an hour after eating at this location (a reaction so severe it mimicked food poisoning). My bad.  

Won't be returning here in the future. Better (and safer) eats elsewhere.",2

Service-The same unattentive service you expect expect in chinatown.  Waiters need training and more discipline.  It does not look good to stand around playing on your phone or speaking overly loud where customers can hear your conversations.  

Hostesses-not very host like these girls need replacing.  Do some work other than just standing up front and then ducking in the back

I came here for the hand made noodles and thus put in an order and informed only after I ordered that there were none available.  I then asked the waiter to inform me when the chef was making more so we could put in an order.  NOPE had to spot the chef making more and flag down our waiter to order.

Incidentally, this Anglo is a former long-time and informed habitue of Silicon Valley noodle places, a frequent Vegas visitor, know my way around Vegas Chinatown, always have a car to get there and know how to get there with vehicle and sanity in one piece.

You can expect luxe decor and I've always found the flavors and food quality quite adequate.   HOWEVER, the prices will be double, there can be a significant wait on weekends at any normal meal time, and the service will be the same authentically haphazard affair as at ""authentic""  places everywhere else .    I suspect these latter considerations prime many reviewers to be more sour on the food itself than it deserves.

I like the fact that you can watch them hand pull noodles towards the front of the restaurant by the entrance. They also have several fish tanks that adds a splash of vibrant color from the otherwise contrasting white decor.

The food is freshly prepared, but overpriced compared to your typical Chinese restaurant, but what isn't in Vegas? 

They have a rather extensive menu to entice just about anyone. 
-Lead by Executive Chef Li Yu. -Attire is casual. -Average price of an entree is approximately $25. 

These are the following dishes I've ordered at Beijing Noodle No.9: (2 adults, 2 children) Ordered far too much. Our eyes are bigger than our stomachs..evidently.

-Special Seafood Soup (one size) $113.99/ individual bowl. (The flavors were very ""clean"", but too bland in my opinion.)

-Braised Sea Bass in a sizzling clay pot $23.99 

-Walnut Prawns in Mayo Sauce $20.99 (I actually really enjoyed this dish, the prawns were huge, fried to perfection, and absolutely succulent.) 

-Beef Chow Fun $16.99

-Braised Beef Brisket & Tendon Noodle Soup $16.99 (you can choose what kind of noodle to have it with. I opted for the more traditional choice for this dish; hand pulled/ stretched noodles.)

-War Wonton Noodle Soup $16.99 (This was a very ordinary dish that I wouldn't order again.)

-Green Onion Pancake $7.99 (I requested for it to be extra crispy which was delightful.)

-Xiao Long Bao, Soup Dumplings Pork (6 pieces) $12.99 (I definitely prefer Din Tai Fung's XLB) 

-Pork and Chives Dumplings (Boiled or Pan-Fried, 6 pcs.) $10.99 

-Shrimp and Chives Dumplings (Boiled or Pan-Fried, 6 pcs.) $12.99 (I opted for Pan Fried for both orders.) 

-Seafood & Egg White Fried Rice $16.99 (Ordered this in lieu of white rice, it complemented the other dishes very well)

-Seasonal Mushrooms w. Black Pepper Sauce $15.99 (I was quite disappointed when this came out with mainly white mushroom.) 

-Pea Leaves w. Golden Garlic $19.99 (Paired well with the fried rice mentioned above.) 

-4 Thai Iced Teas $6.99 each, we added boba (bubble, pearls etc.) but I forget how much extra they charged. 

-Sichuan Dan Dan Mien $15.99 (I believe we ordered this with the knife-shredded noodles to change it up a bit.) 

-Beijing Pancake Wrap with Cilantro (1) (Beef or Honey BBQ Pork) $8.99 (We opted for Beef, and if I remember correctly we all enjoyed it.)

I know I'm missing a few dishes, but I think it's safe to say that I pretty much ordered something from each section/ category on the menu. We ate ""family style"" and shared so everyone gets more choices, making this review easier. The food portions were fair, the food didn't taste bad, but it was more Americanized to be completely honest. I can see why the reviews for this restaurant is all over the place; it is overpriced, and didn't taste necessarily ""authentic"". 

Service wise: We were seated quickly, and the servers were friendly and attentive. 

Overall, it's a nice concept, but not a restaurant I'd ever crave. I do agree with other reviews that it's overpriced, but again, we are talking about Vegas. Everything is overpriced in Vegas.. maybe we're paying for the experience. Will I return, possibly, but it wouldn't be my choice. I'd go if someone else wanted to eat there. Personally, I'd rather eat at Bacchanal Buffet next door because there's definitely something for everyone, at one set price.",3

Food was top notch.  We had spicy dan dan noodle, steamed dumplings, and the BBQ pork pancake.  All first rate, and loaded with flavor...spicy, but not palate-deadening,   Pancake was authentic as all get out ...just like I've tasted on street corners of TaiPei.  Dumplings weren't to my taste, but hubby happily scarfed them down.

What brings it down to 3 stars only? The staff was horrendous. Not just one person but everyone involved. 

The restaurant was quiet when we arrived. Yet, the hostess made everyone wait for tables (empty ones that she later sat them at anyways). 

My parents are 7 Star (aka they usually get to skip the lines) and she told us that she'd sit us next, nope, she didn't. She sat others next, which was fine if they didn't wait forever also to be seated.

She often disappeared into the restaurant and customers were just waiting outside like, ""Where the hell did she go?""  

Then when we sat down, the waiter wasn't too polite either. He sometimes talked back to my parents just because my mom wanted to make sure he used the hand pull noodles and not the other kind. He replied with, ""WELL DUH."" Um thanks dude.

I chose panda express style items and expected the taste as panda's as well. I was starving enough to appreciate if the food was editable.

While i was waiting for my food, i was watching the noodle soup open kitchen. An old man was non stop making hot noodle soup. The way he cuts the noodle with his long finger nails, the way he dips his thumb in the soup, the way he touches order paper, wet towel, and food back and forth, I was loosing my appetite already.

I finally got my food, the cold bread crumb sized fried chicken pieces tossed in sodium spice. Seriously, garnished green onion pieces were bigger than the chicken pieces. Also the chow mein was served cold, soaked in oil.

I received a glass of water and I placed my order. I ordered the chicken and seasonal vegetables. She brought me over a fork and set it down without a word. I tend to get a little irritated at that, because I'm a white person, I'm an ignorant who can't use chopsticks? 

The food came out ridiculously fast but I was a bit leery the chicken was undercooked. It tasted okay and I never got sick but it didn't seem particularly well done. Similarly, the vegetables were cut a bit haphazardly. Typically, vegetables are cut small enough to easily pick them up with chopsticks. These vegetables were left in unmanageable chunks.

For our main courses we ordered Mongolian Beef, which came with steamed white rice.  The beef was tender and the vegetables that it came with were fresh. This was probably my favorite thing I ate.  The rice was a small portion, I would have liked more rice with my meal, I don't remember if they charged for more rice..... But, I'm sure the helpful waitresses would get you more if you asked..... The combo Chow Mein was equally as good, lots of vegetables, meat and had the perfect amount of saltiness. Overall I had a great experience.... Shout out to Chris the Assistant Manager, he's a rockstar. Prices are on the average to expensive side, nothing out of the ordinary for Las Vegas Strip prices though...Use your Total Rewards card for discount. I will definitely be back!

Side note:  This restaurant doesn't deserve the 2.5 stars it currently has.",4

Stir fried Lobster is pretty yummy. My FAV thing on the menu is the XO Hand pull Noodle. Being part Asian, this stuff is done perfectly.

I sent my crispy chicken in tasteless sauce back.  The chicken was either over cooked or frozen, depending on piece.  Chicken chow mein and general tso's chicken were both awful!  Portions are tiny and price is way too high.  We all left feeling very unsatisfied and maybe a bit sick.  There are plenty of really good Chinese and Thai places that will deliver to Caesars, which cost much less and have better food.  Stay away from this place.",1

The noodles are indeed hand made and taste very fresh but there is almost zero flavor with any of the food they offered in their large menu. And I'm not some white dude judging Eastern food from a Western palate. I love Chinese food. At it's worst, Chinese food can at least be salty. This food lacked anything. It was like eating nothing. They brought out sriracha and everyone at our table used copious amounts of it to add anything to it.

We had a large group of 9 people and shared a big table with a lazy Susan and were sampling a lot of things. 

The soups, the plates of varying kinds of chicken and beef offerings, it was extremely bland. I've never had Chinese food not taste like anything. It was like eating air.

Food was on the expensive side, but only mediocre. I've had better at mall food courts, but maybe this place is healthier or something. Waitstaff seemed pleasant, however seemed unknowledgable about the menu and were slow. I asked for a recommendation and the waiter just kind of struggled. Food came out irregular and slow, which was odd considering half the room was empty. My dad got the duck soup which came out first. He finished eating the soup, and then we sat and waited for everyone else's food to come out. Portions were small, no one in my family came out full. Also rice is not included on entrees? 

And the crab fiasco. My mom wanted to get the crab but we wanted to check the market price. We asked the same waiter and everyone at the table all heard $16.99. When we got the bill it was $59.99. To be fair there was a possibility that we heard the waiter wrong (plus he had an accent), but I doubt it. Looking back I was more shocked than upset, but the crab price was just a ""nice"" topping to a bad dinner and service. We felt we were deceived and now this mediocre dinner was definitely not worth it. I talked to the manager and she was quite understanding and took off some of the price of the crab. When signing the bill, she had to clean off the table so I had space to put down the bill, just to show how incompetent the waiters were.

We ordered pot stickers, mushu pork, and chicken fried rice. Pot stickers took forever, we were warned about that but still. They were ok, nothing special or great. Mushu pork and rice was gross, I only ate it because I was starving. The meat was just blah.

Then you notice some shit.

You notice the presence of the uncanny valley, eerily tucked into the botox-frozen veneers of the two silicone enhanced, Bebe-minidress-bedecked Chinese fembots. You notice that for some reason these Stepford wifeys have five neon-colored drinks set out for just two neon-colored people. You notice the chef, with his dead mackerel eyes and creepy, all-upper-teeth grin looks EXACTLY LIKE THE DUDE LO PAN FROM ""BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA"" and is pulling apart what are supposed to be some tasty noodles but are CLEARLY the pearly white remnants of an immigrant culture's broken dreams.

BUT broken dreams are what Vegas is made of, amirite? Our server said to us, ""people come here because they like the experience of a real Hong Kong style restaurant"" and I was like NAH YO I checked that privilege at the door when I saw the Chun Li waitress costumes and $20 price tag for a bowl of congee. Fuckouttahere with that. BUT when you're eyeballs-deep in a hangover after one too many mega turnt #selfies from the night before, that congee and a pot of jasmine tea is a godsend, even if you're getting price gouged in a tweaker's funhouse version of a real Chinese restaurant.

I loved the Spicy fish the waiter recommended, and I also liked Buddha beer, which I hadn't tried before, but neither was different from what I'd find elsewhere for half the price.

I especially recommend the mini wontons in hot chili oil appetizer and the eggplant in szechuan garlic sauce entree. Service is accurate and prompt.

Rule of thumb, a Chinese restaurant isn't authentic if the service is great, and even the service here is pretty authentically bad! Still above average for a Chinese restaurant though! Also, I was also pretty excited about my visit to Bejing Noodle No. 9 because your typical authentic Chinese restaurant resembles a hole in the wall, but this place is really REALLY nice inside! Of course its the strip on Las Vegas, everything is nice inside!

I couldn't believe that my girlfriend, a Chinese native, when on vacation from our San Francisco suburb where most of the good food is Asian to come to Las Vegas to eat MORE CHINESE FOOD. The prices aren't great but then again, that's a recurring theme if eating on the Las Vegas strip. These prices would never be acceptable if you found this restaurant outside of Las Vegas, but it works here on the strip. 

As far as the food goes, it's pretty fucking good! Any place that serves hand pressed noodles, barring any major setbacks is automatically four stars in my book. To take this even further they even have a prep chef you can see from outside the restaurant through a window hand pressing the noodles like some sort of culinary show.

My girlfriend ordered beef noodle soup and Xiao Long Bao and it was pretty bomb, I really didn't expect to find such good Chinese food in Las Vegas. I splurged and went for the $30 duck meat fried rice, which was the best fried rice I've ever had. And for $30 it better damn well be. I also ordered the Shu Mai which was actually pretty average by San Francisco standards, but still hit the spot. Also, this place gets bonus points for using real tea leaves in their tea. We ordered the Pu'er tea and drank all of it!

If your comfort food is xiao long bao, xiao mai and beef noodle soup and you're in Vegas you should check this place out. If the extent of your Chinese food experience is Panda Express and kung pao chicken you should also check this place out so you can get a glimpse of authentic Chinese food.",5

The female hostess have no interest in helping you and there is a big sign in the front that says ""allow the hostess to sit or check you in"". Something of that sort. However, there is no smile, no welcome, no nothing. Maybe it's a cultural thing............maybe not since I'm familiar with the culture and it's nothing like how we saw. We finally sat and was greeted by a nice gentleman. Sure he was nice, and took our order but after that, we never saw him again. Literally.......No one ever came to refill our drinks, ask us how our meal was, bring us napkins, straw, our bill? We had to track down everyone for things...

All the negative reviews of this place say the same thing. The level of service is awful. Caesars Palace needs to do something about it. 

Think about it..............",3

My wife and I were intrigued by the hand twisted noodles, but as far as taste goes there was nothing special.  Food was plain and boring.  I had been meaning to go to this place every time I was in Vegas because I love the restaurants in Caesar's.  Needless to say I was highly disappointed by this one.  Service was ok, but they took forever to bring us our rice, which we ended up canceling because of the noodles.  Great concept, poor result.",2

Being starving late at night in Vegas when you need to wake up early and not break your bank is a rough place! So, when I checked into Caesar's I walked a few steps towards the palace tower, saw this joint and committed. 
I asked for the bar, which she suggested I do a table (weird) so table it was! My waiter was prompt and my food came quickly as well. The food looked like it was going to taste greasey and bland. It lived up to my expectations. The tofu was prepared okay, but this claimed vegetarian dish has a sauce that reminda me of the congealed fat when you store pot roast at a cold temperature. 
Everyone in the restaurant seemed about just enthused as me. 
Had I not been starving and had this meal not been $25 pre tip, I may have just nibbled. I would not really suggest anyone try it.",3

871007,k0polzeLGFiGCg7jpiE6mQ,bCRrLdBLel3y73tA8w6C3Q,"I am very surprised by the number of poor reviews for Beijing Noodle. This is a very authentic Chinese restaurant and there are no P.F. Changish dishes going on here so maybe that's part of the problem. I am only knocking it down from 4 to 3 stars because the service( even for a Chinese place) is challenging and in true fashion it's hard to get away from the MSG here. 
 Some general notes-observations that may help:
To get real hand pulled noodles is such a treat!  Quality takes time and costs a bit more plus Beijing Noodle No. 9 is in Caesars Palace- not Circus Circus. Do the math.   This is the kind of place you just need to time correctly to get the most out of your meal and to  suffer the least amount of aggravation.  During the peak lunch and dinner hours expect to wait for both seating and your meal. If you are down for waiting for the real deal then this is it, yes Chinatown is cheaper, but again you are in the ""Palace"" and the convenience and surroundings are unbeatable. 
If you can heed the tips above and want some authentic and satisfying Chinese freshly pulled noodles then your patience will likely be rewarded.   
Beef with Hand Pull Noodle -sensational and complex beef flavor.Not all that spicy a advertised.

The XO sauce works well with the velvety noodles but the MSG is a bummer for me.

Asparagus and Scallop in XO sauce- well executed by not my favorite of the lot. 
The scallops were a tad sandy and that is always a no-no.

The pulled noodles are as good as I anything I can remember from Hong Kong or Macau. The star of the establishment are the noodles, it's a noodle house dressed in a fancy box at Caesars. Translation, don't expect a sauce or broth bomb. You are getting exactly what they are advertising. I for one have enjoyed this place on several occasions. Don't go there when you are super famished or you will just go nuts with the process.  I for one will go back and enjoy their fine fare again, patience in hand.",3
871008,jlZXFt4fhWNEp7bALEGdJw,bCRrLdBLel3y73tA8w6C3Q,"Definitely not worth the wait as many have posted.  The place is new, and the quality of the service and organization reflects it.  However, this is Las Vegas, and one would expect experienced management to be running the place to ensure that tables are quickly seated and turned over.  We waited in line for about 40 minutes.  BTW:  Even the gold, platinum, whatever members of the casino in their own line were kept waiting.

Okay, first of all the furnishings:  guess there was a special at Ikea because the chairs were you typical plastic, Ikea, collegiate dorm seats.  The restaurant is noisy.  After sitting there for about 15 minutes, our server took our order.  Waited another 15 minutes for it to come out.  We ordered the soup bow (6/$12) and the Beijing Zhia Jiang hand-pulled noodles ($18).  The soup bows were luke-warm and chewy.  The hand-pulled noodle dish was also luke-warm, very bland (even we had to add some chili sauce!) and very skimpy on the toppings.  By this time, we just want to get out of there.  Took another 15 minutes to get our check and pay.

Bottom line:  Combined 90 minutes of waiting for about 10 minutes of luke-warm food.  Maybe after a few more months, it will get better.",2

I have to say I was grossed out by the cheese they used on it. I normally recommend this place.. but I guess they have been cutting back like the Luxor has. For that I'll rate it as A-OK for the price.

I did notice the Fried Rice was especially great, had more flavor than usual,  still a bit bland though.  I loved the Soft tacos I made, wish they had sliced black olives. I tried using whole black olives but they tasted awful.  No big deal I left it off the taco.

I have to say the price you can't complain but the green beans were really old. as seen in the picture I snapped.  I left disappointed thinking they might of gotten better.  This experience just didn't cut it for A-OK this time.. I've experienced Better.

Plus the cashier that rang us up Edna was saying I couldn't use my Buy One get one on Bconnected Mobile app.  YUP!   I flash my App at The Orleans and they just zap it with the bar reader!!!

Dessert station was a waste of space, just a bunch of pie and some soft serve. 
The server was like 80 wearing a ridiculous amount of makeup. She looked like she just crawled out of ""fear and loathing in las vegas""- not a good look, she also smelled like cigarettes and when I asked her how she was doing, all she said was fine and looked at me impatiently as if I was inconveniencing her by asking how she was before giving her my drink order.

The prime rib was okay. The desserts were the highlight and loved that you could get 'fresh' slices out of the display case vs. pre-sliced dried out pieces on plates like most buffets.

I consistently wasn't sure if I would get to a bathroom in time for 30 hours straight.

Under $6 for lunch from 11am-4 pm.  Mama Beijing I will be back,3

888145,aXZixBFrrE4YANzFjj6dfw,oWiicnW4twnBLFT3sAVpGA,"I stopped here while in town for a convention and I must say that for the price, my meal here was a far better value than meals I've had on the strip for twice as much $. This place is very small and although it mostly does delivery and take-out I enjoyed the cozy atmosphere and decided to eat-in. I ordered the General Chicken, a favorite dish of mine, and this place cooked it perfectly and added a good bit of pepper to kick it up a notch. Also, this was a quaint family-run small business which was evident by the manager helping a grandson with his homework as I walked in- the same manager was very friendly and struck up a conversation with me which was much-appreciated. All in all a highly enjoyable meal and atmosphere, wish I lived in the area so I could come back often!",4

Better than some of the more expensive places around the strip! Family dinner with soup, fried won tons, 2 entrees and fried rice was more than enough for a family of 3 at a reasonable prices.",5

888151,mNq-HVLhc7UYYH5Zglm4QA,oWiicnW4twnBLFT3sAVpGA,"I don't like to make negative comments but I was very very disappointed with the way they treat customers. Not sure about food which may be good or not. Anyhow I when call to order, it was nice and simple until it was 1 hour and half late, I understand it could be busy from time to time and business can be out of control. What ever it is you don't treat customers like this. I.e I was slammed off the phone type of rudeness. Already late, didn't offer to give discounts, I waited and waited, called more than twice to check order, guy finally came but didn't to come to the door and ask me to come down and when I said I couldn't he slammed the phone, I called the manager, she then slammed the phone on me and refused to pick up when called again. They may be busy but a quick word thank you or I'm sorry I will offer something to compensate will be better than slam. I don't think I can get the money back for this at all. Rude and unprofessional behavior. They can act like this because I already paid for food and tips. Unbelievable",2

It's the quintessential hole-in-the-wall that has a ton of delivery traffic so it is loved by locals. While the dining area is small it is unique and enjoyable. The Manager is super friendly greeting you with a smile at every opportunity. The food is fantastic, and leave room for green tea ice cream.",5
888153,x2oF0IDZuNqeWPAdbaFASA,oWiicnW4twnBLFT3sAVpGA,"This place is okay. It's not the best Chinese food I've had, but it'll do in a pinch and plus it's close to UNLV. If you're on a budget you can't beat their lunch combos only $5.95 and their dinner combo for one only $8.95. With the lunch combo you get an entree item, fried rice, and soup. With the dinner you get an entree item, choice of noodles or fried rice, an appetizer, and choice of soup. Between the two soups they offer -egg drop and hot& sour- I'd go with the egg drop. Both times I've gone I've had the General Chicken which is pretty good, so I'd recommend that. The noodles aren't bad either.Overall this place is good; great prices, delivery, accepts credit cards, and close to UNLV. Try it out!",3
888154,13H5jkLiSGOIhaPFWToXuQ,oWiicnW4twnBLFT3sAVpGA,"Hard to believe this place only has two reviews on Yelp.  We were in town for the Mountain West Basketball Tournament and wanted to get away from ""The Strip"" and find something to eat before the game.  While driving around the UNLV area, we noticed Mr. Bejing in this little strip mall type place next to a pizza place and a sandwich shop.  We got there just after 4pm and their menu said the lunch prices ended at four.  The server said we could still get those prices so that was great.  My friend had Kung Pao chicken and I had chicken and broccoli.  The food came out quickly, was piping hot and tasted really fresh.  Everything from the service to the food to the prices were great!  I had some hot and sour soup that was very good as well.  We really didn't want to get gouged for another meal in our hotel or around The Strip and felt like we hit the jackpot in finding Mr. Bejing.",5
888155,o6HlV3v_2BkbNVAcalIMaA,oWiicnW4twnBLFT3sAVpGA,Lunch special is definitely worth it hefty serving and freshly made I ordered the garlic chicken soooo good! Small and cozy in here and good service,4
888156,IGpgNYaR0ucjslkkiKsjaw,oWiicnW4twnBLFT3sAVpGA,"In this case, the Yelp general rating and reviews here have let me down.  Nothing about Mr. Beijing was above average, I'd actually put it a little below average. They meet about what I expect for this kind of place if they are not preparing food to order.  It all tasted like buffet food that just came out of a warming tray.  The service was incredibly fast which is telling that they weren't actually cooking it to order. Stale & flavorless, barely warm, and didn't look particularly appetizing.  Generally sesame chicken is not quite so yellow, it looked more like lemon chicken with sesame seeds, but it was definitely an attempt at Sesame chicken, but the meat was stale and had an odd flavor and the sauce didn't taste like what I've come to expect and again, was mostly flavorless. The most surprising thing to me was the white rice, it was actually undercooked and crunchy. Or maybe it was dried out and overcooked from sitting around too long.  I have never had a low-end chinese restaurant screw up white rice.  I'll at least give them 2 stars because other than the rice it wasn't inedible.  I probably should only give them a single star because in my home city, a 4 star rating on a place like this would be a neighborhood favorite that cooks everything to order, and a place producing food of the quality I experienced at Mr. Beijing would only be visited by folks who don't know any better. Vegas seems to have high end overpriced places o' plenty, so I expected the standards for lower end stuff to be a bit higher.  I'm disappointed that I was wrong about that.",2

Ordered Szechuan Chicken and disappointed in the quantity of chicken. Very disappointed.  Also ordered wonton soup. Wontons are so over cooked they disintegrate upon touching. 

Food is tasty, just underwhelming in presentation. At $22 it's priced in the high side.",3

I ordered the honey pineapple shrimp with pork fried rice and the rice tasted nothing like fried rice. It was orange and disgusting and the shrimp has a thick glaze and a weird taste.

Very little meat in either dish and nothing, but shredded carrots, celery and onions and mushy. Fried rice was not very good. Sadly no leftovers for the morning, had to throw it.

A huge mistake that could easily make someone sick. I called, and they said they would send a new dish. That replacement took over an hour and a half to arrive (so 2 and a half hours spent waiting for food). No apology, no offer of refund. I asked about getting a refund for that dish (not the rest of the food) and they said no. Shady business with bad customer service and low quality food. The other dishes we received were cold, congealed and flavorless. Would not order again.",1

Location: Can be easy to miss if youre not paying attention, it kind of blends in among the other stores. But just look out for some asian props and you'll see it. 

Vibe & layout: Went around lunch time on a tuesday and were seated down immediately. Really chill place nothing special.

Customer service & food: Our waiter was super super nice. Letted us know about some specials they had and options. My friend ended up going with the lunch special for orange chicken? w/fried rice and egg drop soup, I went with the garlic chicken w/fried rice and egg drop soup. For the price definitely a great bang for your buck place. Egg drop soup was on point. Personally I liked my friends order than mine, I'm not too much of a veggie person and didn't know mine came with a whole bunch haha. Loved how the food was steaming hot when it came out too :)

I've been going here for a couple of years and the owners wife still remembers me and my family. Lunch special is $6 huge portions and you also get soup. The hot and sour soup is the way to go. Also order a side of chicken wings. I've brought many of my friends here and they've enjoyed it just as much as I have. I don't really write reviews but for Mr. Beijing it's a must.

888177,KfvZQOQrjbORTbEldVmMeg,oWiicnW4twnBLFT3sAVpGA,"I have been craving quality Chinese fast food for a couple of months now.    No that is not an oxymoron, QUALITY and FAST FOOD can be a great combination.  Oh yea and reasonably priced, there no since in overpaying for sh***y food, granted people pay for sh***y food everyday but that's none of my business.  So on to this review...
As stated above I have been craving quality Chinese fast food for a while now, I live walking in Chinatown so it should be easy to find what I'm craving for right????  No, not really, now don't get me wrong they have great Chinese restaurants in Chinatown, but I am and was more looking for the ""Cali-Style"" Chinese fast food.
FYI: IF YOU HAVE NOT DOWNLOADED THE YELP APP TO YOUR PHONE, YOU NEED TO RIGHT NOW...ok download it after you read this review.
Coming from the gym, I pull up the Yelp app and do a search for Chinese food that was somewhere in the area of the gym.  Mr. Beijing's pops up, what caught my attention was the highlighted orange message that read ONLINE ORDERING.  Ahhh Shiggy, I can order my food before leaving the gym parking lot and by the time I drive to the restaurant my food will be ready??  Yes, yes this is what happened, I ordered my meal at (via online) at 8:11pm, I got to the restaurant at 8:21pm, the lady at the front asked if I was there for PICK UP.  I said yes, I walked over to the side to sit and wait for my food.  My buttocks barely grazed the seat before the lady yelled out PICK UP READY.  Wow, I didn't even get a chance to check-in yet, all I could say was ""Whoa, that was fast, Thank You.""

I ordered the SPECIAL DINNER C, I promised that's the name.  

The SPECIAL DINNER C comes with the following:
- choice of entrée (multiple options)
- egg drop or hot and sour soup
- choice of fried rice or chow mein
- choice of one the following: egg rolls, cream cheese wonton or friend dumplings

All for $8.95 w/ tax it comes out to $9.76, that's right under $10.


So I got the Orange Chicken entrée w/ fried rice, egg rolls and egg drop soup.  Like a kid waiting to open presents on Christmas day, I couldn't wait to get home to unwrap that plastic bag, and flip open the lids of those styrofoam containers.  And like the happy fat girl that I am, I started to do the happy dance.  Yea Buddy, flipped that 1st lid and ""POW"" a massive amount of rice and orange chicken.  More than enough for one person more like enough for 3 people.  Next lid flipped, Egg Rolls ""POW"" ok, more like ""Chime"" (2)egg rolls, with sweet and sour sauce., and the last, egg drop soup, no adjective for this one, it was egg drop soup (I'm not an egg drop soup fan, it's not my thing but it came w/ the meal.)

Looks can be deceiving, it looked super yummy but I had yet to taste it. 
Fried Rice - Fluffy, not greasy, not sticky, good flavor, the peas and carrots were not mushy, still had firmness to them, in addition to that fresh diced onions were in the dish as well.

Orange Chicken - this is always a hit or miss at Chinese fast food restaurants for example: overcooked, chewy chicken with soggy breading drowning a some kind of orange like sauce. NOT THIS CHICKEN here, yes, the chicken took a dunk in orange sauce but it still had crispiness to the breading.  A nice crunch when I bit into the chicken, tender and juicy.

Egg Rolls - Light and crispy, flaky, in my opinion no sauce is needed.  I wish I had ordered extra, they are that good.

Egg Drop - I didn't try the sorry

Overall experience, awesome place, I cannot count the amount of times that I have driven by this place.  Heck, I didn't even know it was over there but thanks to the trusty YELP app I came across this gem.  And that's why I am giving them 4stars.  I really enjoyed the food here, but the true test will be when my mom comes and visit, she is a Chinese fast food connoisseur, but for me it's still 4stars.  This is just my opinion, try it out and tell us what you think.",4

894527,30AWtYmX3BLxb8SYI8YNwg,GmAGA39Wjv3MLT2ju5ALQQ,I had never been to a PF Chang's before eating there in Las Vegas but I was highly impressed with the experience. We ordered from the lunch menu which also came with a free soup. Julia D had tofu and brocoli and I had chicken fried rice. The portions for lunch were huge (I expected smaller) and I ended up taking the rice to eat as an afternoon snack. The combined spend for the two of us was only $30 which made it excellent value and I would happily recommend it to anyone in search of a hearty lunch in Vegas.,5
894528,n3aDkQNmTXwf7V7u3bovdw,GmAGA39Wjv3MLT2ju5ALQQ,"The setting and the view were very nice, but after coming here I will never come back to a PF changs. The prices are WAY to much for what you get, and it really pisses me off when I can go down the street to Henderson and get better Chinese or Thai for a quarter of the cost. I know they are in a prime location here but the food is the same price in all the locations even the ones that are not prime. 

And the restroom is a five minute walk away which was very annoying 

The server was one of the best servers I've ever had. 

Come here for the experience and great customer service but don't come here for the food because it sucks!!!!!!!!!",1
894529,FCYhQWBhaM-amJhZdKaTWw,GmAGA39Wjv3MLT2ju5ALQQ,"Not much to say, standard PFC food, pretty good, atmosphere might be a bit nicer than average, service was just ok on our visit.",3

We started off with the egg rolls and they were the best egg rolls I've ever had.  Then came our entre, we ordered the shaking beef & pork lo mein for my husband and I to share.  My husband loved everything but I couldn't eat any of the meat because it was extremely salty, both the beef and the pork in the noodles were very salty so I just ate the noodles.  With that said I wouldn't take any one with high blood pressure to this place.  I don't have high blood pressure and I couldn't eat this meat.  If for some reason we decide to give this place a second chance I will have to order a vegetarian meal.",3
894531,-UEYh31yTS-O2JEwFTMDIQ,GmAGA39Wjv3MLT2ju5ALQQ,"Yes, P.F. Chang's can be found pretty much anywhere.  I like to stay at PH, so this is always a convenient place to get some fake Chinese food.

My only gripe is that I called in for a take-out order and eat in my room.  I phoned in and they said it'll be ready in 15-20 minutes.  I get there at the time they said and I paid.  I waited an extra 30 minutes.  Almost an hour to get my food.  What?

And the best part?  I tried ordering a soda and the cashier for the take-out.  He still wanted to charge me almost 4 bucks for a soda.  No complimentary soda after standing in front of you for almost 30 minutes after the time they said my food would be ready?  Whatever.

It's not like the take-out line was super busy either.

I like this place out of convenience.  I think they deliver to your room too?  But I don't want to mess around with the service fees/taxes/every other fee they tack on.  Stop being lazy and pick it up and eat while you're getting ready for a night out!  Unless you want to eat there too.",3

We were there recently and apparently some beauty pageant was going on because about 50 women wearing sashes with state names walked by as we were eating.  Needless to say, all the guys around were gawking.  That aside, the food was great as usual.  I really like everything here, but the one thing that always stands out for me is the flourless chocolate dome.  Please, save room for dessert.",5

894534,onhCHKYVTHSTjd0fnzuXeg,GmAGA39Wjv3MLT2ju5ALQQ,"Food is indistinguishable from any of the Chinese spots you can order by meal numbers.  Therefore, it's overpriced. I wouldn't mind paying what I did if it was a good meal but it wasn't memorable.",2
894535,jXBYQdQ40BbcRwo_Hf6gSA,GmAGA39Wjv3MLT2ju5ALQQ,"This was my first time eating at a P.F. Chang's restaurant and I was not impressed by their food. The flavors just weren't there!

I eat at Chinese restaurants regularly in the Bay Area and I'm not a fan of non-authentic Chinese food but I thought we'd try ordering take-out and bringing it up to our room at PH. I do have to say their take-out counter is very convenient and is located next to the entrance.

We ordered the shaking beef which was too salty.  I'm a fan of salt but this dish had way too much.  The Dan Dan Noodles were ok. It was a little mushy and lacking flavor. I've had Dan Dan noodles at a lot of other places but this one tasted different. Cheesecake was good but tell them to put the raspberry sauce on the side, it tastes gross.

Overall, if you 're looking for some take-out, staying at PH, hungry for Chinese, and have enough points on your Total Rewards players card so you don't have to pay for your meal then order here and try different dishes.  P.F Chang's is just too overpriced and their food is just ok. Total price for shaking beef, Dan Dan noodles and cheesecake was $37. We could have eaten at Gordon Ramsey's BurGr again for the same price and had a good meal but were too lazy to sit down and eat at a restaurant in addition to BurGr being super busy.
I suggest going to the Rio and eating at KJ Seafood and Dim Sum if you feel like Chinese. They have much better food!",2

This year was a 5 star because of our waiter, Greg.  He was funny and on top of everything.  He started our night off great. 

As for the food P.F. Chang's food is always good but if you are a true Asian food connoisseur then this place is not for you.  In the end if want good food and drinks that are reasonably priced in Vegas. This is a great place.",5

We ordered the honey chicken, pad Thai, Mongolian beef and fried rice.  We also had spring rolls and crab Rangoon for apps.  It all was great and some of the best fried rice I've ever had, which is an odd thing to say but it was delish so it's a must have on my list.  Our waiter was quick, friendly and he knew the menu well so he made great recommendations.",5

The ginger sauce on the mixer plate though, will clear your nasal way if you have any issues. It's that strong! Lol. We sat outside since it was such a nice day and had entertainment as people walked by the guy covered in gold paint, posing as a statue & scaring people. The little birds were flying around and eating rice that fell on the ground (cute but a bit annoying). Our server was decent and wait time was minimal. Overall, it was good and we are likely to return.",4

They are also dirty with dried saliva on the outside.  So when we are walking away, the man comes and opens the door.  We are greeted by the host who hasn't moved an inch because he is behind his counter with his iPhone in hand and drinking tea or soda....so I ignore that....we are seated outside.  The window that faces the strip had some dried substance that looked like mucus or something...ick!!  So we are moved....then we are looking at the menu prices...I don't wanna pay that much for food when I am surrounded by mucos and saliva with bad service...I picked up and left & probably won't return....shame on you!",1

the look and feel of the restaurant was nice. next time, I'd love to eat upstairs in the private area where they had a wedding rehearsal dinner going on.

We ordered chick wraps and the chicken salad. Nicolas birdsaw was our waiter. I repeat Nicolas birdsaw was our waiter. He made sure with a smile of course we knew who he was. The food was good. Nicolas birdsaw actually originally wasn't our waiter but because we moved and no waiter came to serve us he took over. He was very friendly and had a dry sense of humor.

It was so convenient to our location that we ate there for lunch 3 times during our stay. The food was so fresh and flavorful!! One of the exciting experiences was sitting on the patio, enjoying a bottle of Hess Cab, all while people watching.  Tyler was our server and he treated us so well!  We even had one of the managers stop by to see how our meal was and just chat with us for a bit.  That made us feel special!  Her name was Kristi.  Kristi, Tyler, and the whole staff were so kind and friendly to us.  It was a great experience and definitely merits a fourth lunch visit in the near future.   Thank you PF Changs",5

This past weekend we were heading there for dinner and my cousin (who is diabetic) wasn't feeling so well.  We were seated immediately with no reservations and the manager was so sweet, she brought her a glass of fresh squeezed orange juice.  She came over several times during our visit and checked on us.  We had an awesome time (there were 7 of us).  We ended up finding out she was from Washington State and she even worked at the restaurant we frequent in WA.  Planet Hollywood PF Chang's is awesome!!

It was the first time any of the five people in our party had been to Chang's, and we weren't sure because it is a chain restaurant.  Everything we had from appetizers to dessert was great, but the best part was our server Jose.  To say he should be mentoring every server in Vegas, would be an understatement. Although he was quite busy, he made us feel like we were his only table.  We liked the food and service at Chang's so much, that we made a second trip before leaving town.

Sesame cucumber- under was soy sauce.. Really salty...

My entrees came and it tasted like the plates have been sitting there for seven minutes. Outside was warm/murky inside was a little hotter.

I ordered lo mein (chicken fried noodles) and coconut veggie curry.


Best was the curry but kinda salty and they give you a bowl of rice. With tips, Total was forty dollars. Blah.",3

We had just gotten into Vegas and this location is not ideal because of all the people outside of P Hollywood trying to get u to join things and what not. We asked him how the hell can we get out of here and not pass the people out front? And he gave us directions to go out the side door Hahaha. 

Anyways, the food was so so. It's a PF changs. Not terrible but not great. Dan Dan noodles kind of watery. If you're hungry and have a coupon like we did it's worth stopping",4

We were with a large group (about 24 people) and the menu had already been chosen by the person holding the shindig.  The meal consisted of: vegetarian lettuce wraps, fried green beans, pork dumplings, lemongrass salad, Kung Pao scallops, honey chicken, mongolian beef, pork lo mein, and brown and white rice. 

Perhaps it was because of the size of the group, but everything (except the Mongolian beef) seemed really greasy.  Greasier than usual.  And the scallops were overly fried and greasy at the same time.  Still, I left with a full stomach and satisfied taste buds.

Their Moscow Mule was fabulous, though.  The service was really slow because it was only one server for about half the meal.  Once he had backup, things went much better.",3

I love Asian food but I've had better at hole in the wall restaurants than I've had at PF Chang's. The pricing is a bit high, but I understand because it is a nicer atmosphere. People rave about their lemon chicken but I think it's a bit average. I don't know... I just don't get the hype.

My coworkers and I went to this location for a dinner meeting and were sat in a very nice, private room. They only left 1 server to deal with all 20 with us, so both food and drink service was very slow. Orders were forgotten and it took over 3 hours for us to eat.",3
894572,4c3q_E8gxuXrYIAvuzd1ZA,GmAGA39Wjv3MLT2ju5ALQQ,"I have ate at the St Louis resturant a few times and was never dissatisfied. This is my first visit to the las vegas location and I was a little disappointed in the service and the food. So to start off we are waiting to be seated the hostess trys to stop one of the waitress to seat us and she mumbles something back in the lines of she is busy so the hostess starts to seat us and another waiter jumped in and seated us. It took about 10 mins before waitress came and took our drink and food order. We get our soup and i ask for the won ton strips takes almost 10 mins for that and us to get straws that we didnt get when we got our drinks. The servers says sorry about the wait on the strips were busy....now my husbamd and i look around and wonder how are they busy? Yjere was not a lot of people in the resturant at the time, maybe 7-10 at the most. After the soup and lettuce wrap which is hands down my favorite thing the resturant serves this dish is amazing the balance between the chicken and water chesnuts is perfect.  My husband got the shrimp fried rice which he enjoyed but he said it could of had a feew more shrimp in it bit overall grest dish. I ordered the pepper steak it was a little on the salty side and not hot like it just came off the stove asaid from that it was good. The desert was a fav of mine i order it from where ever serves it tiramisu, the portion wad small for it to be a shareable dessert we did the changs for 2 for 44.95 so its a good thing my husband does not eat dessert.  It took forever after i ordered it for it to come, my biggest complaint was the slow service, she told us 2 different times our food was on its way out and it never came til 15 mins after the first time she told us. Not my worst experience at a restaurant but not the best either",3

My hubby and I come here every year on our wedding anniversary for lunch. (4 years total now). As soon as we land and check in to our hotel we come to P.F. Changs! The service is always pleasant and the place itself is wonderful. The decor is great and very clean. Here are some of our favorite dishes. Appetizers: The egg rolls are a must try. Very crispy and taste so good with the choices of sauces. We also enjoyed the pork dumpling and the chicken lettuce wraps. Oh let me not forget the northern style dry rub ribs which are absolutely delicious. Now for the main course. You must try the Mongolian Beef with pork fried rice. The beef is so tender you can't stop eating it. The drinks and beer are really good as well. I personally like the cosmopolitans. Trust me you won't be disappointed. They also have a happy hour where you can eat and drink for a great price. After you're done eating you can go right outside the doors into the Planet Hollywood Casino and have some fun. Overall this is one of our favorite places.,5
894575,GA6TUoMIlO0a9QEuxYg4Cw,GmAGA39Wjv3MLT2ju5ALQQ,"Usually PF Changs is a place with great service and food, this location lacked both. I came here with my family of seven on vacation in Las Vegas. We came around noon and at time, it wasn't busy.

First off, our server lacked the intelligence to take our order. I wasn't sure if she didn't understand what we wanted to order or if she wanted us to buy the more expensive dishes in order to get a bigger tip. Either eat, it didn't seem like she cared of providing good service.

The food was god awful. Everything was dry and had little to no flavor. The rice that came with the dishes were extremely dry. If I were blindfolded and eating their rice and bits of paper, I wouldn't have known the difference. We ordered the salmon and asked it to be cooked well. It came out with the inside still pink/slightly cooked. 

Overall, everything was poor. I enjoyed the restaurants decor. That's a plus.",1
894576,nnTQ4REJL8ZvXmBHTLZGRg,GmAGA39Wjv3MLT2ju5ALQQ,"I've invented an invisibility formula. Sort of. 

From now on whenever I don't want to be seen or talked to I'm going to go to the P. F. Chang's at Planet Hollywood in Vegas. My wife and I were shown to a table fairly quickly, which was good. But I was convinced that we were going to witness the second coming of Christ before a server approached our table. This was bad. We had just been book shopping before coming in here and I was thinking that maybe I had time to read my new book before we were waited on. I could have written one.

A waiter, suddenly remembering that he had a job, finally came to our table and thanked us for our patience. There was no apology offered for our wait. Just an 'Atta boy' for hanging in there. He asked if he could start us off with some drinks but since we already had an eon to stare at the menu we were able to give our full order right away. I ordered the Chang's Spicy Chicken because there's nothing like sweet & spicy chili sauce when you're feeling ill-tempered. I didn't even bother to take a picture of my food to go along with this review. So if you've never seen what spicy chicken looks like - or a bottle of Budweiser, than I'm sorry to disappoint. But whenever I can't give you a picture - I WILL give you a thousand words.

Everything started to proceed somewhat swimmingly from here -  and 'swimmingly' isn't a word I use very often so that's a testament to how much better things really were going. We got our food pretty quickly and it was good. The waiter even came by asking if he could get me another beer. He was probably trying to get me drunk in hopes that it would increase his chances of getting a decent tip (didn't happen).

Then the invisibility formula kicked in again and we could no longer be seen or heard for another extended period of time. My wife asked if I wanted to get dessert but I was worried that might take another eight hours. I just wanted to pay the bill (or the 'check' as Americans so charmingly call it) and get out. We were finally able to get the waiter's attention and hand him our credit card. He disappeared without a trace for about ten minutes or so. I was starting to think that they truly didn't want us to leave. This must be how Henley and Frey felt when they wrote ""Hotel California."" And Don Felder too. A staff member eventually approached us and said that their credit card machine was down and that they were waiting for it to come back online. Later on it did. And we left - never to return.

""Hotel California"" has always been a work of mystery with no one truly knowing what the lyrics are really about. I do. Me, P. F. Chang, and I suspect - H. G. Wells. Along with Henley and Frey, of course. And Don Felder too.",2

We normally get the Orange Chicken and Mongolian Beef and it was flavored just right, not over-salted. The appetizers came out quickly, the food was delicious, and the service was excellent.

You guys are awesome!",5

This is yet another time I faced horrible service. 1st off, waited for about an hour for the food to arrive and no one even cared to come and talk to us about it. Second, we ordered 3 drinks and given 4. We ordered 2 shrimp fried rice and 1 chicken. We did get 2 of the shrimp 1st and after waiting for another 20 mins, got the chicken one (for the person in our group who avoids shrimps), which had shrimp at the bottom. Ok mistakes might happen, but when we asked about this, the waiter simply waived it off saying ""I ordered whatever you guys asked for, the kitchen messed it up, and it wasn't my fault"". I wish I could get up and leave right away.
I would have given a minus -1 star if that option was available. This was my second if not third (if I could remember correctly) with PF chang's.

  I really hope this location works for them, because it's never that busy in here.  They are just far enough away from the hustle of Chinatown that they'll miss out on some business, but at the same time, it's quite obvious that everyone in here knows each other, and the wait staff is sure to recognize you if you are a repeat customer, which you should be.  

All dishes I've had here are great, from lamb dry pot, to mushroom/pork, and boiled beef/tofu dishes.  All cheap, and large quantity.

All the dishes were authentic Hunan.  While eating, my husband said that if we could nail reasonable airfare in the future, we would come back for another meal.

Today is our first time visit this restaurant.  As we (4 of us) sat down the first thing we noticed the sticky table.   So we had the waiter come over clean the table one more time.  We ordered 6 dishes as we were excited to try all the popular dishes.  The end result was such a disaster.    Everything taste extreme salty and oily.   The entire experience was awful.   The owner also try to sell some dishes is not on the Manu also without inform us about the price.  She recommended us a chicken dish all we got was broken end pieces with crash bone!  The presentation was like someone s leftover.  It's salty with no flavor!!  We are Chinese and we know what is good Chinese food.   This place feel dirty and definitely is not good Chinese food!  It's terrible!! We will never go there ever again!!   Sorry it's this bad!",1
897675,qt7hcZ_qftjO0kmlXfKJew,40axkHtNTmROdIMQJ_gOsw,"It's your average Chinese restaurant interior, nothing special and nothing fancy in decor. In fact they use plastic table setting. It's a family owned business and the dad I believe is the chef and the mom runs the business with her two sons whom take the orders. The mom is very sweet and personable, hands on and interactive. She'll even advise you if you ordered too much, which is a rarity in Chinese venues! Ha! The menu does not have pictures so if you have never been to this type of cuisine before it'll be hard for you to order. I would recommend going off by the pics on the wall or asking the owner for assistance. I ordered stir fry pork and pepper very traditional in ""Xiang"" cuisine. I'll always order the Duo Jiao pepper fish which is typically steam fish in a  pepper broth but I requested to have a whole fish instead of just the head. Both dishes were authentic in flavor, you will sweat and your sinuses will be cleared! The fish is amazing here, it's just a whirlwind of flavors so impactive and immediate when you take each bite. I recommend drinking tea to mellow out the spiciness and not water.",5

Their carpet so stink that I am so gross out. I think they should change the carpet.. The booth is not comfortable at all. When I arrive, it was hot and bright. I requested to be seated very close to TV. They said no. Those table weren't occupied! I always did like the spicy fish head and tofu bean curd.

We took the mother in law who is from the panhandle of Texas and she was completely blown away by the grub.
You people who bitch about not getting your tea fast enough or sticky tables or food too spicy a should just continue to go to Mac D's and KFC and stay out of restos that you can't comprehend.",5

She said it was okay and nothing would be awesome because she's from China. So, I decided to try this place because I was in an Asian mood. 

First of all, the location was not too difficult to find. It is in the same plaza as Jinya Ramen.  My friend had already been sitting there, and we chatted so we were not ready when the waitress asked us if we were ready to order. 

We ordered the chicken gizzards with pickled radish, lamb with cumin, pork tongue, some fish. Now, the meat entrees all tasted and looked exactly the same. It was as though they just changed the meat. The entrees had bell peppers, cumin, and just all in all tasted the same. 

We really wanted fish and tofu, so we asked them if they had any dishes like that. They told us they could add tofu to the fish, but it would take about 20 minutes. We were fine with that. Our fish came out, and they asked the table behind us if that fish was theirs. The couple said no, and they brought out our fish to the table.  Later on, they said they made a mistake. They brought out another fish without tofu, and gave it to us. My friend told them. We wanted tofu. They said oh we gave it to the wrong table. Uh... How is that our fault. We specifically wanted fish and tofu. The owner agreed to bring out a new dish with tofu in it. The fish tasted really good. It was really soft and delicious as well as the tofu.  The fish was my favorite part of the meal. 

They do get quite a few tour buses. We were sitting there eating, and the owner would receive a phone call every so often telling them how many people the tour guide was bringing. I guess they get a lot of business from that. I prefer Yunan Garden way more!",2

The bamboo shoot chicken soup and the rod was the best, albeit everything was served cold and all the  food wasn't served at the same time. I think it should have been $50 per person. the dessert was horrible, it was sesame ice cream with chocolate cookie, the ice cream tasted like nothing and the cookie tasted bitter.y vegetarians friends got a fruit plate and that was def more enjoyable than or fancy dessert. again, the food was decent, just too bad they were served cold!

Some of the food (cod) was cold, some food was overcooked (scallops, sirloin). The waitress was giving our wine to another table, after which she said ""I was just checking"".

All the food was excellent.  Service was excellent as well, except for a mix up where they served me the same entree twice.

Also, their take on Peking Duck was seriously lacking.  It was basically two pancakes with duck skin inside them.  I'm not even sure if there was duck meat.  For 40 bucks extra that was pretty lame.  The table next to us thought so too.

My favorite dishes were the Crispy Duck salad, a great combination of unique flavors, on the sweet side but still refreshing. My favorite dish was the Black truffle Roasted duck. the rest of my party loved both these dishes and the res of what we ordered was great too. The dumplings were unique and a definite as well. The braised lobster with spinach noodles was delicious and a quite a different dish that it was very enjoyable to try. Just hate messing with the shells from the lobster. 

The atmosphere is intimate, upscale, and modern with interesting water lighting on the far wall. I enjoyed how you could not see the rest of the restaurant except through some patterned walls. It feels like a labyrinth but I very much enjoyed this concept as I do not experience this very often in Las Vegas as most of the restaurants are"" see and be seen"" type atmospheres.

(OK enough British slang).

Not your neighborhood Chinese.  You won't find sweet sour here.  Dishes are individual courses.  Some are meant to be shared, others not.  

On this evening, without looking at the menu, asked the server to just bring our party, some of the best dishes.  The result:

Crispy duck salad.  Incredible balance.  The richness of the duck balanced by the bitterness and acidity of pomolo, earthiness of pine nuts and texture from pomegranate seeds.  

Braised abalone with black truffles.  Soft, tender, impregnated by the sweetness of Chinese wine, the earthy flavor of the truffle the aroma enhances the sweetness of the abalone.  

Peking duck with caviar.  Not the classic Peking duck (this one has some breast meat attached) but wow, soft pancake, pungent scallion and snappy cucumber, crisp duck skin and to top it off, caviar whose oceanic flavor adds an incredible, unexpected complexity. 

A delicate, crisp quail with Chinese five spice and chili sauce, a perfectly roasted Chilean sea bass with Chinese honey whose sweet but bitter notes brings out the natural flavor of the fish, an nontraditional fried and steamed dim sum platter whose freshness, taste, and quality, will put all but the best to shame rounded out the meal.

Service is very efficient and friendly.  The wine list, well chosen.  Typical Vegas resort prices.

Staff is very polite & helpful when asking questions about the menu. So this is my first experience of what I call fine dining and first experience of a Michelin star restaurant.

We arrived at the restaurant at 8pm. 8.01pm we were seated, and given the wine menu at 8.02pm we had bottled water, and by 8.05 we had our wine, tasted and poured in both glasses!
So about the wine and water, we never had to pour any into our glasses, there was always a waiter around to do this for us. Top service.

The food is only what I can class as the best I have ever had, starter, main and deserts all highly rated. I recommend the mango\duck starter and sea bass cooked in honey for the main. The wait between courses were minimal. Even though we only had a table for 2 hours, it didnt seem rushed to put away a bottle of red and 3 courses.

The atmosphere of the restaurant is very nice, warm and welcoming, as soon as you walk in you are greeted and asked for your coat and then escorted to your table. There is an ambient lighting. The tables are quite close to each other, which is always an issue to me especially when having private conversations, however on a Saturday night because the atmosphere and noise levels its not much of a problem.

Its not crazy expensive, but for me its not cheap. You could easily blow what we spent on good food on a night out, so its worth a visit if you have a special occasion. Its opened me up to a whole world of fine dining and given the opportunity I shall be returning!",5

Its like they took the sweet side of the chinese flavors and fused it with american sized portions and pricing.

We opted for a more carb-free version and shared this between 6 people:
+ crispy duck salad which had lots of sweet, salty, and fatty flavors going on.  best dish IMO
- seared scallops with fresh mango in chili sauce which was cooked well but nothing extraordinary on the flavors.
- Jasmine tea smoked beef short rib, the waitress cut it up for us but it seemed like a typical dish.
-Stir-fry lotus root with royal trumpet in sweet XO sauce was definitely on the sweet side and overwhelmed the natural flavors of the lotus root and royal trumpet
--Lobster soup with tofu and Chinese yellow chive was probably the worst soup dish ever.  for the price we paid (it was like high 20s) it was a small little bowl that barely had any lobster.  What happened to family style dishes?
-Hakka braised pork belly claypot, pork belly was melt in your mouth tender with a sweet sauce.  nothing spectacular.
+Braised lamb shank with Chinese herbs was pretty good as it was meat falling off the bone and not overseasoned.  It might be to gamey for some, but it was perfect for me.
+Roasted Chilean seabass with Chinese honey was another good one that had the fish just flaking off
-Crispy chicken in lemon sauce which reminded me of a chicken katsu covered in a lemon sauce. nothing extraordinary.

Total bill came out to about $465 with gratuity and that included a round of drinks.  

Ambiance was definitely really nice as everything was well decorated in the restaurant, hip music in the background, and dim lighting (although too dim for my friend as she could not read the menu).  Service was really good as they were very tentative and water cups were never empty.  A plus side is that they escorted us to the club afterward and we did not have to wait in line to get in.

It was the price and food portion that would deter me from coming back.  I could have gotten traditional chinese food without all the nice service and ambiance for about $100.  But its Vegas.. just roll with it sometimes.",2

I was excited to try Hakkasan and went with a buddy of mine.  We are lucky to have been to a lot of great places in Vegas, so we were looking forward to eating at Hakkasan.  As suggested by the server, excellent service by the way, we ordered two small plates and two entrees.  For the ""small eats,"" we ordered the Hakka Steamed Dim Sum Platter and the salt and pepper squid.  For the entrees, we ordered crispy roasted duck with kumquat and mustard sauce and a special from the Chinese new year menu, a sea bass dish.

The small plates were both disappointing.  While looking over the menu, I asked what ""Chinese Honey"" was since I had never heard of it before.  As I suspected, it was just a made up ingredient that the kitchen created and labeled as ""Chinese honey.""  Either way, the dim sum was bland and overpriced.  I could have gone to Ping Pang Pong or Cathy House and gotten much better dim sum for a quarter of the price and larger portions.  As for the salt and pepper squid, both Ping Pang Pong and China Mama's are much better.  

The Chinese new year sea bass was exceptional.  It was super flavorful, had great texture, and I would order it again.  As for the crispy roasted duck with kumquat and mustard sauce, it severely lacked balance and needed some type of sweetness.  Otherwise, it was simple bland with one note of flavor related to the mustard.  

All in all, Hakkasan is a lovely restaurant with great service.

We did share the entrees and each of us got three bites. The service was mediocre for a place  that charges these prices, very little interaction between the waiter and our party.

928129,kCix5URl47acwIWGq6Jl_g,Ieuv-XET6SR_qIscZzgD-A,"*** Review is for Spring Restaurant Week 2014 menu ***

This was a late addition to my Restaurant Week lineup.  I'm so glad I made the change.  I was warmly greeted at reception and asked to wait until one of the people who seat you arrived.  A short time later, I was taken to my table through what appeared to be a maze of small hallways and dining spaces.  I was seated at a table in a section near the bar that was L shaped.

Soon, the server, Carmen, arrived and she asked me about drinks.  I ordered an iced tea and that was brought quickly with a small container of simple syrup.  I had studied the menu online and I knew what I wanted except for the main course.  I asked Carmen for her advice.

For the first course, I went with the stir fried spicy quail with fresh lily bulb.  The dish was prepared with Chinese 5 spice and chili sauce.  It had a really nice tang but it was not overpowering, just very good!  There were two legs and 2 wings--a very ample serving for a starter.

For the main course, I went with the stir fried venison with spicy yellow bean sauce.  There were three thin slices of venison in a great spicy sauce.  With the venison, I was served two sides--a small container of fried pak choi with garlic and a small bowl of vegetable fried rice.  Carmen brought me a knife and fork for this course knowing it would be easier to deal with the meat.  I had requested wooden chopsticks (they don't have them) because I am very poor at using plastic chopsticks.  Things slip off plastic chopsticks very easily even when I'm just looking at them.  I'll have to bring in my own wooden ones or my screw together metal chopsticks that were a gift.  Again, the dish was spicy but it was not overpowering spicy.  It was quite enjoyable.

There is no choice for dessert.  You get a passion fruit panna cotta with, as the menu says, citrus supremes, guava gelato, and blood orange sorbet.  Carmen had me listen to a crackling sound when she first brought the dessert.  She wouldn't tell me what it was but said I should try it and we'd talk about it when I was done.  I had two things in mind for what it was.  I was correct with the second idea.  They put some pop rocks on the panna cotta to make a bit of a texture play.  The panna cotta was very good.

To sum up, the food really is the ""dog's bollocks!"" (Thanks R).  Portion size was just right and they downsized the sides because I was dining alone.  The room is delightful--not one large room but made up of many smaller areas.  The restaurant really isn't all they big in the great scheme of things.  Service was excellent.

Before bringing the bill, Carmen brought me a coupon good for $50 on my next visit as long as it's used before April 10.  She said, ""It's like having your dinner tonight for $.14.""  I will be back and use the coupon.  I have to do the sea bass which she said was their most popular dish and is excellent.  

One short aside:  I can hike in the desert where there's no trail.  Leaving last night without an escort, I ended up almost in the kitchen.  Then I realized I had almost made a complete trek around the outside ring of the place.  I did make it to the door and was somewhat embarrassed getting lost in the small space.  It's a like a maze!

I'm glad that Restaurant Week gives me the chance to try some new places that I normally wouldn't.",5

928133,toouJRlu4wHzG0iroqyh4A,Ieuv-XET6SR_qIscZzgD-A,"Ponied up at bar before it got too busy. No one at the bar but me and a couple others. Hakkasan restaurant is UBER sexy but I was a little put off by the snotty female bartenders. Even the lady sitting at the bar next to me noticed their dismissive behavior without my saying a word. 

For starters, it took forever to be acknowledged. When she finally comes over, there was no smile. No friendly greeting. Just a plain face and a cocktail napkin put in front of me and a blank look. She eventually loosened up, but only after I made an effort to connect with her. Should be the other way around though. Just saying. The lady next to me with her BF asked the other bartender what was in a particular specialty cocktail she was making. Bartender looked at her and plainly said...vodka. Then walked away. Wow!!!

If I were giving out stars for service, I'd dole out a 2+. But the quality, creativity and showmanship of the cocktails made up for the bad behavior of a couple mean girls.  

My first cocktail was a vodka made with quinoa. It was really smooth with a sweet, clean finish.  After dinner I ordered the Smoky Negroni cocktail (Ransom Old Tom barrel aged gin, Antica Formula vermouth, Campari and Grand Marnier smoke infusion). Tasted very similar to an Old Fashioned. Classic with a twist. Very good! 

For food I ordered the Hakka braised pork belly clay pot. Very tender and full of garlic and gingery flavors. It's a little rich, so I'd recommend sharing this dish as an appetizer. 

Like most LV restaurants of this caliber, be prepared for a $$$$ experience. 

Enjoy!",4
928134,qsuVn4gHNHrV6zb4jRoeuA,Ieuv-XET6SR_qIscZzgD-A,"Amateur hour as far as management and staff.

We had someone at the table with a shellfish allergy, which was announced, and both the kitchen and service staff mixed the order, which almost ended very, very badly.  The only thing they offered for their extreme mistake, was a bottle of wine.  That's just not what someone who has just medicated themselves should be offered.  Oh yeah, they didn't comp the dumplings that almost killed the person.  Not even kidding.

Anyway, the food was ok.  Some good (duck salad) and some bad (dumplings, hot and sour soup and smoked short rib, which was really quite terrible).

Expect to pay more than you should, and if you have any allergies at all, I just wouldn't trust these folks with your well-being.  Hope that helps.",1

In hindsight we should have ordered another small plate or vegetable because we were still a little hungry. We got the house made macarons for dessert, which were good. The reason I am only giving 3 stars is because the chicken dishes were average at best. I can't comment on the other meat or fish dishes but hopefully they are much better, especially for the price.

We tried a huge variety of menu options. The things that stood out to me were the dumplings and the Hakka noodles. Don't waste your time with the Chicken with satay sauce. It is far too sweet with an overwhelming amount of fennel. The stir-fry ribeye and the Wok-fried Wagyu with sesame sauce were both very good but not out of this world.

They had a wonderful wine selection. And, were extremely helpful in finding me a wine based on my descriptions. It was one of the best Pinot Noirs I've had.

And that's too bad, because what a restaurant it is!  The menu is made up of modern takes on Cantonese classics, but the flavors never steer too far away from the originals.  The dining room is impressive and very easy to get lost in (leave a trail of bread crumbs), but the friendly staff always helps you find your way back to your table.  The bar is long and beautiful and features an impressive cocktail program.  Bring a small group of friends, get a bottle of sake (or wine), and choose a number of dishes to share.

928149,_6ctAi06WXAixqSzpFQpuQ,Ieuv-XET6SR_qIscZzgD-A,"Absolutely my favorite place to dine in Vegas. Here's why:

THE SERVICE - the staff is fantastic,they are ever-present but not hovering,very polite and approachable and are more than happy to answer any questions you might have. My favorite server is Maggie,she's waited on us a couple times before and remembers me by face - a rarity when you wait on a multitude of people. 

THE AMENITIES - everything in the place is class; they have an ice bucket in every section,so the servers can come and freshen your beverage at any time. Paper towels or hand dryers in the bathrooms? No sir,there's an attendant who hands you a warm towel to dry your hands. 

THE FOOD - oh my god. The food. If everything else in this place was sub-par,the food would still get them a 5-star rating in my book. From their starters to the custom Hakkasan cocktails they serve,everything is one of a kind. Vegetarian and gluten-free options are available on the menu as well. 

My favorite options on the menu are the crispy duck roll appetizers (well,anything duck,really) and the braised pork belly platter (literally melts in your mouth). The dim sum is superb as well,as they feature a mixed platter as part of their signature dishes which includes seafood and poultry. 

A must try,definitely. And when you're done (if you're on the guest list),you're more than welcome to go through the back entrance into the 3-story nightclub that feature some of the top-tier DJ talent (Tiësto,Calvin Harris,Hardwell,etc.)in the world!",5

Even the veg members of our group had plenty to eat with the prix fixe menu they arranged for one of our friend's last nights of freedom (before he is sentenced to a term not less than 25-life, to be served in an environment of tartan sweaters, baby showers, and Home Depot runs).

Yea, there is almost zero talk of the food in this review... This is what happens when I file a field report two months late.

928166,aoNoCf1OGETEURCAGrWzTQ,Ieuv-XET6SR_qIscZzgD-A,"Words cannot describe how much the BF and I love the Hakkasan restaurants.  We were amazed by the Miami location, so we knew we had to try the Las Vegas location.  We planned to go to the Hakkasan Nightclub that evening, so it was perfect.  The restaurant and club is located in the back of the MGM Grand Hotel.  The signs made us walk through the entire casino, but you can just walk straight back and miss the twists and turns. 

The ambience and decor, like the Miami location, was beautiful and trendy, but it was way busier than I anticipated for a Thursday evening at 11pm. But hey, that's Vegas I guess!  Our server Carmen was a gem - she had a great presence and engaged with us throughout the entire experience.  

For starters we got the Crispy Duck Salad (which we had in Miami) and Seared Scallop with Fresh Mango in Chili Sauce.  The duck salad was of course amazing, with pomelo and pomegranate.  It is so fresh tasting but at the same time heaping with duck meat and crispy skin!  The scallops were good, but my amazing.  Although the mango and chili sauce was killer.  

For entrees we decided to get the Roasted Mala chicken with cucumber and cloud ear mushrooms and the Hakka noodle with mushrooms and chinese chive.  The Mala chicken was out of this world.  The portion was huge, more than enough for two people, but we kept eating because it was so darn delicious.  The chicken was tender and the skin was thin and crispy.  The sauce was flavorful, actually reminded me of a more mellow sate sauce, and complemented the chicken wonderfully.  The cucumbers were nice touch as they cooled your mouth down from the heat of the sauce.  The Hakka noodles were also amaze balls.  The noodles were a perfect texture and size (yes, I am so picky about the size of my noodles) and the mushrooms and chives tasted great mixed into the dish.  

I got the Hakka cocktail, which is vodka, sake, coconut, lime, passion fruit and lychee juice.  It was so refreshing and I love the taste of lychee juice in my cocktails.  I didn't finish it, so Carmen asked if I wanted a cup for it so I could bring it to the club.  

Side note - I am always amaze how reasonable the prices are for such a highly rated restaurant.  

Now here is the secret - if you dine at the restaurant and you want to go to the nightclub, just ask your server.  Carmen led us through a back entrance, where we went up a set up stairs and were id'd by one set of bouncers outside the Ling Ling lounge.  We then walked through the lounge and gave our restaurant bill to another set of bouncers who stamped our wrists.  After that, we walked right through a skinny hallway and then BAM, you walk right into a massive, yet intimate, wraparound club which envelopes the main DJ stage. 

Hakkasan, the restaurant and nightclub, are experiences that must be tasted and felt.  A review does not do it any justice.",5

I was originally planning on ordering the dim sum platter but for $28 for 8 pieces (so, $3.50 a piece the size of a chicken nugget--or smaller), I couldn't justify ordering this when I know you can get 4 pieces for $2.50 at most Chinese/Asian restaurants.

Instead, I opted for the crispy duck salad for the same price and MUCH MORE BULK.... more bang for your buck for sure! AND, it was out-of-this-world-delicious! There there small chunks of crispy duck skin, pieces of pomegranate and citrus, and lots of greens. My friends kept re-dipping their forks onto my plate.

My friend and I shared the hot & sour soup and it did not disappoint. It came out steaming hot, so be careful, but the taste was perfection. Again, probably overpriced, but one of the cheapest items on the menu.

I got to try the scallops from my friend and the shot rib from my other friend... both delicious. There wasn't one bad dish that we tried. We also paired the meal with a bottle of red between the 5 of us and were all able to have at least one glass.

The service was impeccable. The service was very commendable. I would highly recommend coming to dinner here.",5

The food was good, but they cut the portion in less then half for those who wants to take advantage of this event. We left hungry... shame on you, Hakkasan, that's NOT the way to do good. No way I need to pay that much and get so little for the money.",3
928171,pJfsD_5-kvt4F6KBt167KQ,Ieuv-XET6SR_qIscZzgD-A,"Hakkasan's Restaurant Week menu looked like a winner, and after sampling its offerings, my dining experience here proved to be that and more.  

First off, the place is quite classy and elegant.  It has an upscale ambiance with seating divided into small cloistered sections by iron and wood partitions.  Cushioned half-booth seating features different colorful Chinese dragons embroidered on off-white expensive-looking fabric.

For the appetizer course, a Steamed Dim Sum Platter featured a woven basket holding big bite-size morsels of Har Gau, Scallop Shumai, Chinese Chive Dumpling, and a Black Pepper Duck Dumpling.  The fat dumplings were all very well made by hand, and delicious.  I liked each one, as well as my bite of Diane's Crispy Fried Prawn Dumpling that was rich with prawn meat, enhanced by fruity and sweet but not overpowering Plum Sauce, and decorated with Fried Rice Paper Noodles sprouting out of the prawn's top.

An add-on of Vegetarian Hot & Sour Soup was excellent, suitably spicy, and filled with delicate thin noodles.  But in retrospect, I wish I had instead ordered the Hot & Sour Soup with Chicken because I was later informed that it was identical to the vegetarian variety with chicken added, and both soups were priced the same.  To help wash everything down, I enjoyed excellent house-brewed Mint Decaf Hot Tea, with the tea leaves blocked by a tiny strainer. 

My entree of Roasted Chilean Seabass with Chinese Honey, alongside a few fried Enoki Mushrooms, was very tasty.  Sections of well-cooked moist white fish burnished by the honey flaked off nicely onto a fork.  Fine, generously portioned sides of glistening, stir-fried Pak Choy with Garlic and Egg Fried Rice rounded out and embellished this portion of the meal.

Inventive Summer Exotic Cold Watermelon Soup with assorted berries and Lychee Sorbet brought our memorable dinner to a refreshing close.  Service was exemplary throughout the night, and wet towels were produced at meal's end for a nice final touch.  It was a great Restaurant Week meal.

In sum, Hakkasan offers a very refined Cantonese dining experience that is expensive, but worth it!  Now that I have had a taste of its stellar cuisine, I will surely be back to enjoy more.",5

928179,sl4Vb1_bD6JVeYAIeJLRsA,Ieuv-XET6SR_qIscZzgD-A,"A friend and I came here last night to have their Golden Week prix fixe menu offered during two weeks coinciding with the Golden Week in China.  Except for a service glitch, the meal was excellent!

My dining companion and I decided we'd like to try the crab and sweet corn soup as well.  This was brought first and even though we were sharing, we were not brought smaller, separate bowls so we just ate out of our communal soup bowl.  The soup was not exceptional in any way.  In fact, I tasted just like egg drop soup.  

We were not finished with this extra soup when servers brought out our small eats--the Peking duck and the steamed dim sum platter.  This was the first of two times when we were rushed by bringing out dishes when we weren't ready.  It didn't happen again when it was made clear that they should hold up on more main dishes.

The Peking duck was fantastic.  Small pieces of duck with a small amount of breast with crispy skin, a thin rectangular pancake, and some crispy cucumber.  The duck was topped by Tsar Nicoulai Reserve caviar.  The flavors of the caviar with the duck and the crispy cucumber was great.  The dim sum platter consisted of har gau, scallop shumai, a perch dumpling, and a black pepper duck dumpling.  The flavors were again wonderful!

The mains started arriving a bit too quickly and this is where we asked them to wait until we were finished with these first ones.  The three mains brought out were the braised whole sea bass in claypot, the crispy prawn, and the fried rice with diced abalone.  The crispy prawn was a spicy dish.  It had three green peppers with heat and it was served with dried chili and cashew nuts.  The sea bass was perfectly cooked and there were nice pieces of tofu with the bass.  The fried rice was very good!

After a break, we got the last two mains--spicy Szechuan rib-eye beef and the roasted crispy chicken.  The beef was a star of the meal.  The beef was in a rich sauce, not very spicy at all despite its name, and served on a bed on enoki mushrooms.  The chicken was fairly moist and the crispy skin was a delight.  The mushrooms with the chicken were wild mushrooms and the chicken was in an oyster sauce.  

For dessert, we got black sesame and chocolate dumplings with ginger/yuzu tea.  There were some small boba like lime balls on the dumplings and the dumplings were filled with a semi-sweet chocolate.  Wow!  What a way to end the meal.

We were each given a large Hakkasan bag--a takeaway gift--of two yuzu macarons with a chocolate cream filling.  They did make it home, but I ate them later.  The chocolate cream and the macarons were perfect!

This was a special meal and it's not a 5 star review for me this time because of the service.  With a meal like this, pacing should have been better and dishes not brought out before others were finished.  Our server, Leigh, was very knowledgable and very pleasant and she answered questions when we posed them.

Hakkasan remains high on my list.  It is Las Vegas Strip pricing plus, but I think it's worth the splurge now and then.",4

With Michelin stars decorating locations in New York as well as London, and a similar menu of modernized Cantonese cuisine from Chef Ho Chee Boon offered here in Las Vegas, it was only a matter of time before I visited Hakkasan at The MGM and with the 2014 ""Golden Week"" menu proposing an opportunity to experience a number of plates without investing in a $250+ Peking Duck or $35 fried rice it was with a friend that I finally sat down to dine amidst the darkened labyrinth beneath America's most lucrative club.  Grand in size, with soaring ceilings and dark woods juxtaposing white leather and signature styling, a meal at Hakkasan begins with check-in at an outer atrium and soon to be led between several dividers that serve to break the room into a series of alcoves it was expectedly the wine and cocktail list that arrived first, the upsale on from the start and continuing as the a la carte menu was presented with no mention of Golden Week to be found.  Pleasant and competent in service, despite obviously ignoring the notes in my reservation requesting the special menu and a seat with good light, it was with a single a la carte option that our meal began and with the intricate broth surprisingly vegetal to balance the sweetness of fresh crab I only wish we'd have had more time to enjoy it - the first course of dim sum and duck arriving hot on its heels with no more than two bites enjoyed.  Opting to set aside soup in order to focus on the progression of tastes it was with a sampling of the aforementioned duck that Golden Week began and essentially using the briny eggs to offset the fatty bird's sapor each bite was pure indulgence, the skin so thin it seemed razor cut and the attention to detail soon found to be duplicated in a steamer basket of dumplings from which both the spicy duck and creamy scallop shined.  Moving quickly to round two as I again attempted to enjoy the now-cool soup it was here that a trio of plates was presented and with promises that the 'rest' was soon to come I finally explained that the kitchen needed to slow down, a request thankfully met by allowing us to focus on what was present - the aromatic clay pot and fried rice loaded with tender abalone amongst the very best plates of the meal while the spicy shrimp in an admixture of peppers and nuts was the sort of thing I knew I'd regret later as beads of sweat burst forth from my brow.  At this point only fifty minutes into the meal it was thankfully after a short break that round three arrived and with both dishes using mushrooms as a base to impeccable proteins it was something of a surprise that the tender beef proved to be the best dish of the meal, a melting mouthfeel amidst innumerable spices and light acid that fully engaged the palate without coming off as 'hot' in the least.  Rounding out the evening it was in a bowl of six glutinous rice dumplings that we indulged and with melted dark chocolate bursting forth to mix with cells of finger lime and a broth of light ginger one could not help but swoon, a similar citrus and cocoa experience offered in a duo of golden macarons presented in a take-home box at the meal's end.

Decidedly expensive for a meal that lasted just ninety minutes I remain perplexed to this moment as to why the kitchen felt the need to send plates in clusters at such a rapid rate but with that issue aside I'm happy to say that both ingredients and preparation were exquisite, the opportunity to experience the duck without investing in a whole-prep particularly welcomed considering the sizable scoops of caviar while every other plate was delicious and surprisingly well portioned considering the tasting menu format.",4

In addition to the fabulous food the atmosphere, service, and overall dining experience is top notch.

928182,71NdWQo-QXAdk2HXv_isQw,Ieuv-XET6SR_qIscZzgD-A,"Came here for a 'fancy date night' on the first night of our first ever trip to Vegas.

The decor is beautiful - very modern and maze-shaped, almost like a futuristic Alice in Asian Wonderland.  The lighting could have been a bit brighter, as the menus were a bit difficult to read in the dark and I could hardly see myself in the bathroom mirror.

Hakkasan's menu is extensive, featuring dozens of upscale Chinese cuisine options.  With so many choices, we ordered four plates and shared.  The Crispy Duck Salad was the best of the bunch, with the Braised Pork Belly a close second.  Both were some of the best Chinese dishes I've had in my life.  The Stir-Fry Udon Noodle with Shredded Duck and Fried Soft Shell Crab were both good but not amazing - of comparable quality to other high end Chinese places I've eaten at.

We finished our meal with a couple Irish Coffees.  After such a heavy meal, they were the perfect pick-me-up to send us on our way to a night of drinking and gambling.

Not sure I'll return with so many other places to try on the Strip, but definitely a memorable dinner and a great spot to bring a date or your foodie friends!",4

Food was very authentic, so if you're in the mood for some fancy, real Japanese cuisine it's a must. One of the best dumplings I've had in a long time. You can tell they're just not your ordinary frozen, ""out ofa box"" dumpling, for sure they're hand made.",5
928184,W2I-8woHZA1teVyOvA5UPA,Ieuv-XET6SR_qIscZzgD-A,"Pleasantly surprised. Food was great, service was good and nice atmosphere.  Of course we ate early so it wasn't crowded. I will definitely come back for the stir fry ribeye!!",4

Menu is basically a la carte, so get some rice and an appetizer to share if your are hungry.  Cool atmosphere, dark with soft lighting.  The architecture and design was invredible.  

Ling Ling Lounge upstairs is a cool place for drinks after dinner.  We liked it better than the club.  It had a dj, and the music wasn't too loud.  People can still talk easily.",5
928186,BBVKzSX3ZcT_E_GpFX3B9A,Ieuv-XET6SR_qIscZzgD-A,"If Hakkasan the nightclub is anything like Hakkasan the Restaurant I'll probably wait to head back. There is one very common ingredient that seperates a $10-15 entree from a $30+ one - and it has nothing to do with food. That ingredient is service. I can find a $15 steak around Las Vegas almost as easily as I can find $1 bud lights. The reason I occasionally pay $40 for a steak is because the service I get at the $40 joint vs. the $10 dive is better. The wait staff is more attentive, the ambiance is nicer, it's just a fancier experience start to finish. With all of that said, while Hakkasan does have some good grub, their service is not up to par with the other high end Strip restaurants. They are probably 4-5 stars on food and 2 stars on service, for this one I'm rounding down.

Our waitress wasn't awful, but when the dining fare is $65 a head (our bill was $130 for 2) I expect my glass to remain full, the table to remain clean, and the waitress to remain present. That wasn't a regular occurance on my latest visit to Hakkasan. The food itself was pretty solid. The Roasted Chilean Sea Bass is definitely my favorite item on the menue. Sweet and flaky, this fish is not fishy at all and is cooked to perfection. We began our meal with the steamed dumplings. Very good, you get 2 of the same flavor and four different flavors. 3 of the 4 included shrimp, the other had duck - all of them were tasty. In addition to the Sea Bass we went with a Pork Belly dish. Not sure what I was expecting, but I didn't love this. Way too fatty of a piece of meat for me, though when I did get a bite of actual pork that was very good. The sticky buns that came with the dish were also really good. Our waitress had a chronic case of RBF (urban dictionary that - you're welcome). Not her fault (I don't think), but it didn't help the cause.

For $135 there is better service and better food on the Las Vegas Strip. I can't say I'd go out of my way to dine here again, nor would I want to sway someone from trying Hakkasan. It's good, just don't set your expectations too high from a service standpoint.",3
928187,b_NJ75m6A8sHaG3SiaULLA,Ieuv-XET6SR_qIscZzgD-A,"Finally I got the chance to come and eat at this place that I have heard a lot about. The decor is amazingly beautiful, dimly lit and maze like. It is an authentic Cantonese Cuisine. My friends and I had Crispy duck salad with pomelo, pomegranate and pine nut; Hakka fried dim sum platter roasted duck pumpkin puff, XO scallop puff, crispy prawn dumpling; Braised tiger prawn claypot with taro in Mandarin sauce; Hakka noodle with mushrooms and Chinese chive; and Stir-fry udon noodle with shredded duck and XO sauce. The beef dish was my favorite. They were excellent. The waitress was very attentive and knowledgeable. If you come on Thursday and Sundays and you have dinner you can go the nightclub for free. It is usually min of $30 for ladies. Hakassan's revenge story is pretty interesting and it took $100 million to built this place.",5

The interior is absolutely beautiful and designed down to the littlest details. The music was a nice low tasteful up beat sound. The food was all delicious. We decided to go family style and had the Duck Salad (highly recommended), Salt and Pepper Squid, Dim Sum platter all to start for appetizers. Main courses we the Seabass, Spicy Prawn and the Black Pepper Ribeye. Everything we ate was delicious but I could eat the Seabass and Duck Salad everyday they were both so good. The service was on point and the server was very helpful with helping us decide on the menu. I would definitely come back and recommend this excellent dinning experience.",5

No seriously the crispy duck salad is life changing. Then for your main course the fried rice is a must and I recommend the Mongolian beef to go with it.

The service is great and the food is to die for. I suggest the duck salad as an appetizer and the miso cod for an entree. You can't go wrong with these two dishes. Reservation is highly recommended as they fill up fast on weekends.,5

Also had the champagne cod which was good but the duck salad is better. My boyfriend doesn't like a wide variety of foods and even he loved this place. 

Fruit platter for dessert which was much too expensive for what you get. I ordered it for the exotic fruits which you don't get many of --the dish is mostly pineapple. Also, expected to see some durian but no luck. 

Besides dessert everything was worth the price paid and much more. I would eat the duck salad for breakfast, lunch and dinner if I could.",5

Ask your Yelper Foodie Pendo to make a decision for her birthday and she made the right one. Couldn't ask for a better atmosphere, taste and company. Our waiter took a little time to warm up, but once he noticed we were not the young, pretentious LA girls, he was pleasant and friendly and got our jokes. The DUCK SALAD is to die for, me not being a health conscious kind of gal, this was delicious. I would have eaten it all by myself, but since we did family style dining, had to share. The noodles with also duck was spicy, but flavorful. With an Asian menu, I expected a variety of noodle dishes, but there was only 2. The other with the dreaded mushrooms, so stuck with the duck too. Wasn't disappointed. What was hilarious and entertaining was the dessert. Chocolate Balls. Very interesting concept. Mochi, with melted chocolate in the center, so when you bite into it or you have to put the whole ball in your mouth, it pops and chocolate gushes out. I'm now excited to try the one in Beverly HIlls, apparently a different menu, so I would like to get the dim sum. 
Overall, a ultra, hip dining experience Las Vegas style.",5

Hakkasan on a service level is excellent even though I tend to weigh the quality of the food more than the service in my reviews. The decor and ambiance made me feel like I was back in the City in the Bay or some downtown Metropolitan Area. A big area with many partitions that feels private. Wood & Blue.

I don't really eat any Asian food besides Japanese and haven't fucked with Chinese food in a long time. Not a fan of hoisin or fish sauce either....Saying that, Hakkasan is probably the best tasting Chinese restaurant..fuck labels...one of the best tasting restaurants in Las Vegas!

I went with some friends I worked with and we spent a total of around $400.

These are the items we ordered in the order that they came out in:

Hakka Steamed Dim Sum Platter - Too fishy and not my type of dish

Crispy Duck Salad - This was great balance of duck and greens

Fried Soft Shell Crab & Curry Leaf & Chili - Out of the starters this was the best. With a little bit of rice on the side with soft shell crab...the outside was fried but with every bite, there was a blast of flavor and juices

Stir Fry Black Pepper Beef Ribeye - Very good

Mongolian Style Beef Tenderloin - Out of the two beef dishes, this was more flavorful and tasted better.

Roasted Chilean Sea Bass w/ Chinese Honey - The best dish that we had by far. Buttery, juicy, sweet goodness that seemed to just melt

Passion Fruit Panna Cotta - Perfecto

Chocolate & Black Sesame Cremeux - Not as good as the Panna Cotta but still good

Overall a great experience and highly recommended!",5

Negatives: Not Authentic Chinese, Plastic Plates & Cups, Small, Not somewhere you take a date (Somewhere you take your spouse after you have lived together forever and have seen them burp at the dinner table).

This is my late night: Go-to, I'm too lazy to leave the house, I'm broke, or I just need variety, go-to place. The food is obviously not authentic Chinese food, but they offer a lot of variety in a single plate and they deliver. If your sick, this a great way to get a big container of some basic won ton soup for about $6.00 delivered to your home. The minimum is $10 for delivery. So when I'm sick I just forget the money, buy 2 containers of soup. One for now, one for later, and call it a day. I honestly don't have anything negative to say about this establishment. This is what you expect for hole in the wall, under $10 meal.

Price/Food: Under $10. Their lunch special is around $6, dinner special is $9.50. Each comes with sweet sour chicken, one choice of entree, crab ragoon, fried rice, and choice of soup. Add a Boba drink for $3.50! There are 24 different flavors, on ice or blended as a slushy. Lots of food for the price, it takes me about 2 sittings to finish. Because there is so much variety, I don't get sick of it by the second day. I always have left overs. Enough food for a guy though. This is as healthy as Chinese food is going to get. Yes, the food is smothered in sauces like panda express, but its not as greasy. They use lean white chicken breasts for all their chicken dishes and they cook with crisp fresh vegetables. When I'm hunting for delivery yet attempting to be healthy, I order Shrimp & Snow peas off the regular menu. Not as much variety as the Lunch/Dinner Special. But its the same price, clean, simple, plain, Low-carb, Less-sodium.

Service/Ambiance: Small hole in the wall eatery, about 6 tables that each seat 4, so service and food are quick. Get in- Get out. I've never had to wait in line. One of the major reasons I keep coming back is that they are so clean. There is definitely nothing fancy about this place, but you can see that the kitchen and seating area is clean. They are always wiping their counters, tables, chairs. Wet towel, dry towel. I've NEVER sat at a wet table or chair. No drips on their soy sauce ramekins. I've seen there employees wash their hands multiple times. They get a extra star from me just for that. I'm all about hole in the wall places that are clean.",3

*clean * friendly *cheap chinese place. I had a combination plate with orange Chicken, Egg Drop soup & a fountain drink Mr. Pib. The portions were a good size, I couldn't finish what I had so I boxed it. Really REALLY love Crab Rangon & one came with the plate. I was floored at the bad reviews when I truly thought it was delicious.

We dined in figuring it would taste better fresh vs. Driving home smelling the food & it getting cold & soggy. It was quick service even though the kitchen had lots of slips. They use the same chicken in both Orange & Sweet and Sour but it was quality meats. No stringy chicken like some places that cut corners.

Lunch special $5.95 comes with soup (not available for to go orders), your choice of entree from the list, sweet&sour chicken, and fried rice. It ends at 4pm so if you miss it you still have another great deal for cheap by getting the combination plate.
Combination plate $9.75 comes with soup, your choice of entree from the list, sweet&sour chicken, shrimp fried rice, one egg roll, and one crab rangoon. WHAT? That is a great deal. 

So my brother and I both got combination plates. I ordered the szechwan chicken and he had the beef broccoli. I was not impressed with my szechwan chicken. The flavor was all wrong. It was not spicy at all and the sauce was watered down sweet and salty. My brother's beef and broccoli was flavorful but salty. Their sauces needs some work. We were both impressed with the shrimp fried rice and sweet sour chicken. It tasted better than we expected. I didn't care for their egg rolls they were extremely thin and barely had anything in the middle.

I just might need to try a few other things and ask them  to add less salt. Their menu is pretty big so there's a little bit of something for everyone. They even have a few thai dishes. Not sure if I'll be back since it was just okay and I have a closer chinese restaurant by my house.",2

If you are for the west coast and likey 2nd or 3rd generation Cantonese food then this place is the place to go  if you are from Hong Kong or more of the Panda or PF Chang style of Chinese food then this may not be a five star event for you. 

First look- I first checked if they have tanks to hold fresh seafood and fish. They do so that was a great sign. Now I decided not to order a fish from here due to the cost but good to know that they have fresh live fish. 

Next check was to see if they have real home style soup. The plain broth with some mustard greens and beef bones. Yep they had several choices so I was felling darn good. I did not order a soup due to this being lunch and I was going for the big entree test today. 


My time tested entree test:

Bitter Melon with beef-  the butter melon was sliced thin and the beef was also thinly sliced. Nice flavor and just the right amount if black bean sauce. I love bitter melon and it had to be al dente to be right and this was just about perfect. 

Steamed pork with salted fish-  this brought back the home cooking from my mom and grandma. I love the flavor of the pork steamed and even the juices. The salted fish on top added a nice flavor. 

Steamed flounder - this was about as good as it gets. The fish had the best juicy flavor when steamed with a bit of scallion and green onions. The bone came off easily and the meat was firm. I normally order  a Rock Cod but did not want to pay he big bucks. 19.95 for steamed flounder was just right. 

Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce- my go to favorite but alas the kids ate so much of this so quickly that I only had a bit of a taste. Crispy and crunchy with just the right amount if oyster sauce for a subtle salty flavor. 

Curry Chicken -  love this dish and here the curry was the right spice and consistency. I was a bit dialed that here was not enough chicken or potatoes yet this was still a great dish. 

Chicken with green onion. - this is my all time favorite dish. Simply prepared chicken on the bone and cut up with a sauce made of minced scallions. We ordered a full order vs. half due to wanting to have some for home later. 

To me, this is very home style authentic west coast cantonese food.  I really enjoy this place.

 So based on all my favorite food items, this place I consider to be top notch in my book. GK says check it out!",5

Tip:  it's always a good idea to eat Chinese food with people who are actually Chinese because you don't have to worry about what to order.  I didn't even look at the menu because I trusted that whatever came out of the kitchen would be fine with me and it was!  We came here mainly for the lobster, but also had the French Cut beef with mushrooms, tofu with bamboo shoots, and pea sprouts with garlic.  Everything was tasty, but I especially liked the beef dish. I'm no Chinese food expert, but I dined with some and it was a very enjoyable experience overall; I'd definitely come back for more.

Unfortunately, they've now reached the point where the service is VERY poor and the food is inconsistent leaning towards bad.  I was forced to actually complain about the crab I ordered since it was totally inedible.  And what was the waiter and owner's response....nothing!  They ignored me, and would not even come back over to my table.  They finally sent another waiter over with my check.  No offer of a replacement dish, no discount, nothing.

I used to eat here 1-2 times a week and most of the waiters and the owner all know me.  I always tipped well and never complained about a single dish.  This was the 2nd time in 3 days I ate here and the last time the crab was slightly undercooked too.

All were super delish.  We liked how like the cod was and the salt & pepper with jalapenos gave it nice flavor.  The green beans were cooked just right, though, I wish the beef was sliced thinner.

I don't really know the name of the noodle dish in English, so I'm guessing what I called it is probably close.  These were lunch portions and were reasonably priced.

It's actually right across the stress from where we had Vietnamese the other day and I liked this meal much better.  They gave a type of soup that was like a pork & chicken broth as a pre meal cursor.

Service was fine - no rudeness nor super friendly, just average.  And for me, since there was no rudeness, I would give it 5 stars for being Chinese.  

The restaurant didn't have a lot of people when we went because it was before noon.  The food came quickly and the place clean.",5

As I mentioned in my review of China Mama, this center is super busy, and the greatest accomplishment is finding a parking space.

When we walked in, there was a group of Chinese businessmen in suits, sitting at a large corner table. It almost looked like a scene from an old movie, where the Chinese Mob was planning something in San Francisco.

That was the highlight of this visit. 

The bottom line is simple: The prices were on the high side for this type of food, and the quality just wasn't worth it. From the hot and sour soup, to the entree and side dishes we ordered, it seemed no better than a ""hole in the wall"" take out, that re-heats its left overs.

We were not only disappointed with the food, but the service was less than friendly.

My friend, Phillip gave this place 5 stars 5 years ago. It must have changed owners, and the new owner is cutting corners to pay for the place. 

I will agree with Dave R, and his review. It's worth reading.  

If you have the good fortune of finding a parking space in this center, continue your good fortune, stay away from this place, and walk over to Q Bistro. Your wallet, and your sense of good taste will thank you!",1

We arrived at dinner time.  Surprisingly, the restaurant was not crowded, but more people arrived as time passed.

The food was good, but nothing to rave about.  The waiter got our order wrong though.  One of the dishes we ordered was Rock Cod with Salt & Pepper, but instead he got us Salt & Pepper Pork Chop.  The only reason I didn't fume about this is because my family and I like the pork chop dish as well, so we just let it slide.

A good point is that since we ordered Wonton Noodle Soup, the waiter actually poured soup, noodles, and a wonton into each of the 4 bowls.  I'm not sure if it's customary for the waiters to do that at the Chinese restaurants (despite my frequenting of many Chinese places), but I thought it was good customer service.

He also spoke some Tagalog with us to break the ice.  I was impressed.

The waiters also speak English, which is not always the case at other Chinese restaurants.

Also, when we finished our entire container of white rice, they delivered another full container.  Yes, we eat that much rice.

My only complaint is that they never bothered to refill our cups of water, but this is pretty common in Chinese restaurants so I can't really dock them for that.

Ended up ordering clams with basil, rock cod stir fried with Chinese veggies, Mongolian beef and lobster with green onions and ginger. All the seafood was fresh tasting and solid (They brought me the lobsters live to approve). My least favorite was the Mongolian beef which was spicy to my surprise. The waiter who was a younger Vietnamese gent spoke perfect English and was funny conical but was on the spot with service. What a difference compared to my last visit.

I got pea shoots and Szechuan pork. Both dishes were pretty good. The pork dish had a little too many onions though.

There was a lot of crab, lobster, and fish but I didn't eat any of it. 

There was a slight debacle where they charged us $1 per person for rice, which was something they haven't done before.

Kung Pao beef was well spiced and tasty.  Orange chicken was good but this dish is hard to mess up and didn't wow me.  Egg rolls were crisp and tasty.  Best of all was the sautéed broccoli actually!  Still crisp so it wasn't overcooked and just the right amount of garlic.  Well worth the broccoli farts I subjected my lady to.

After a few disappointing bites I quickly went for my white rice and threw the gravy and accompanying vegetables in the outside trash can.  This meal was an abomination.  This is my first yelp review.  I've eaten plenty of crappy food so, that says a lot.  Roaches wouldn't eat this plate.",1

I will say - for $10.95, it was enough food to fill me up, but the broth was lacking in flavor and they didn't provide any basil to put into the soup.  There was maybe 1.5 oz of meat in my Pho Tai, which is on the low end of what I'm used to.

Why? We were starving, it was early in the morning or really late at night and not a lot of legit places were open on the strip. We were already at Imperial Palace, and all we wanted was Korean food. We wanted to go to a quiet place where we can talk without shouting. See how everything lines up? 

We had really low expectations because the place looks like it's having an identity crisis. Korean, Chinese, Vietnamese, etc. and the name of the place is ""Ginseng"" which I'm sure the owners thought long and hard about coming up with something original. Anyway at that point we were wasted and just wanted something that wouldn't make us sick.

I ordered the kimchi jigae and it was pretty bomb. Not the best one (that would be the one from Seongbukdong in LA) but it did the job. My compadres had bulgogi and bibimbap if I remember correctly and they were fine. We were in such a good mood we said something about how it was awesome we found a decent Korean place on the strip as if we were gonna come back soon. That was 2 years ago but yes, I'm actually glad I found this place because if I'm in a situation where I'm in Imperial Palace again and someone asks if I want a dollar menu spicy chicken sandwich from McDonald's or something else, I know I have an option.",4

Service:  Place nearly empty and staff more intent on watching X games qualifying then changed to UFC fight. Really?  If I wanted a sports bar, I'd have gone to one. 

Was very confusing to find the location as The Quad is the most disorganized hotel layout I've ever seen (Find Verge tower and take that elevator). 

I'd go for the food if you're in the mood for Asian and don't know what country to visit. They offer Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese and Chinese.  Not cheap but not outrageous either.  Don't expect good service because it doesn't exist.

Soondubu is $13.99 - Hello Mr. Tofu for $8! 

Obviously this place is on the Strip, at the Quad, blah blah, but I find these prices ridic!

Anyway, onto the food:
There's no kids menu, so Hunnie Bunnie just had the Pho Tai ($10.99): This is actually great becauae she loves pho. The bowl was big and the flavor was GOOD. It comes garnished with sliced onions and green onions and a side of lime, cilantro, fresh jalapeños and bean sprouts.
Friend and I shared Spicy Squid with Vegetables ($21.99) and Spicy Pork Soondubu ($13.99):
The stir fried squid was extra spicy which was totally awesome and they didn't seem TOO skimpy on the squid but there were TONS of veggies, including kimchi, onions, green onions, bell peppers and jalapeños in the mix. 
The Soondubu came SKIMPY with BEEF! Yeah we ordered Pork but this is what we got. Ugh! It came with lots of broken up tofu which I HATE. I prefer larger clumps in my soup! The soup flavor was just aiight too! 

Service was pretty MEH too.

There's just no direct route.  But location aside, this place is open 24 hours, which is very important in a place like Vegas.

The place looks like a cafeteria, but all of the food is really good.  We usually get the BimBimBap--delicious!  And also the BBQ beef and chicken.  Their marinade is really good.  We also really like the seafood pancake.  Yum!  Once in a while we get the Pho.  It's pretty good considering this place is mostly Korean.  We try out the sushi rolls too.

The food is nothing special.  It's just enough to keep you from being too hungover tomorrow.  They make Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese and Chinese food... but you and I both know that when you make such a wide range of different foods, there is no way you can make all of them well.

Was promptly greeted,  menu'd, watered. I knew what I wanted -- Kimchee stew made with beef... but I guess they pre-make the broth with pork, so I couldn't modify it. Bummer, but i'll roll with it. 

Banchan was rather late in coming out, the stew even later. When the stew finally made its appearance, it was mouth-puckeringly SOUR. I know kimchee stew is inherently tart, but this tasted like they added vinegar to it. The broth was also rather thin, not rich, and just not special. Plenty of kimchee in the stew, but they skimped on the meat. Banchan was spot-on though, well-seasoned, perfectly pickled.

I've been back quite often for the noodles because I love carbs. If you are looking for authentic Chinese food this isn't the place to go.

My favorites were the chicken wings and the fried rice cake appetizer. The wings had a great dry seasoning (which I love more than sauces) and it was moist and crispy. I love rice cake and I love this preparation - the toasted and slightly crunchy exterior and chewy, soft interior. I was surprised how much I enjoyed the dish, although I thought the scrambled eggs was an odd accompaniment. The porridge (congee) was yummy and I love that they have so many different choices! I am a big fan of porridge and this did not disappoint. The fried rice and calamari were good, but I didn't love them. I did like the flavors of the fried rice, especially from the lemongrass, which is different than rices I've had.

We also had a soup before our meal (not sure what it was, but it was good) and a warm dessert soup with sweet potatoes after our meal (great flavor, not a big fan of sweet potatoes though).

Wendy's has potential- they really do. However: 

1. $7.50 for a greasy plate of ginger chunks, rice, and egg is too much. Yelp advertises this as $ but it's really $$. We spent close to $40 for two of us. 

2. Entrees came out way before the appetizer. 

3. The server was either A. Having a bad day or B. Really bad at her job.  She didn't come by once to see how our meal was, we had to flag her down to pay, and her attitude towards us was less than desirable. 

On a good note:

Wendy's just isn't for me. Even though it's a great and clean location with fairly good service and food, there's just nothing that stands out in a good way.

However, I have had a few language barrier issues. Some of their food is meh, especially for the price tag. 

This is quite a vague and bland review, but honestly, that's how I see this place. I love it, but I don't. I'll definitely come back to try it again though and I'll update this review once I do.",3

We ordered take out, so we can't comment on the waiter service, but the girl taking our order for take out was friendly and helpful. 

Food:
We got a vegetable chow mein and a bbq fried rice. The chow mein was delicious!! The fried rice was not my fave.. probably wouldn't order that one again.. 

Price: 
very reasonable. 7.50 for the chow mein I believe.

We ordered the Singapore noodles, Portuguese pork chop rice and beef stew with bean curd hot pot.  Everything tasted okay, but the noodles were barely warm and the ingredients inside like the eggs and char siu were down right cold.  The stew hot pot was also a disappointment. The portion was so small it didn't even fill up half of the pot that it came in.  Definitely not with the price for $11.  The best thing was the Portuguese pork chop rice.  A decent portion of pork chops on top and the sauce was quite good with a hint of coconut.  Still 2 stars in my books!",2

Found this place on yelp and decided to try it - hoping that it's better than KJ Kitchen - cause that place got four stars but it was definitely not four stars for me. Luckily this was a hit!

There were only a few tables of diners when we got there (8:45pm) but then it got busier as it got later. So we each ordered different dishes:

I got Black Pepper Ox Tongue Spaghetti: the ox tongue was super tender and soft and instead of putting the black pepper sauce on the ox tongue, they used it as a spaghetti sauce which was really tasty and different. thumbs up!

My dad got the Sampan Porridge: the porridge was cooked to the right texture - not too thin and not too thick. Seem like my dad really liked it. 

My mom got some kind of noodles but for some reason I can't recall which one....so can't tell you how it was but I'm pretty sure it was good too.

The service was great - the waitress was nice and patient when we took a while to order - even suggested dishes to us. The dishes weren't expensive - average and reasonable prices for pretty good portions.

Overall, if you really want some good Hong Kong style cafe food in Vegas - I would recommend this place.",4

We split Shanghai Dumplings $6.25 for 8. These are Wendy's xiao long bao or soup dumplings. The wrapper was a bit thicker than I prefer and the juice inside somewhat sparse. The flavor was fine. 

We also tried the potstickers $5.95 for 6. Again these were fine, but not outstanding. 

We then shared the spicy ramen, rice cake, beef dish. #133 on the menu. This cost about $11.00 and was our favorite dish of the evening. 

The menu here is extensive, including a large tasty looking dessert menu. You get a large glass of hot green tea in a glass cup and a bowl of salted peanuts when you are seated. The waitresses were friendly, though English was limited. I will definitely be back to try more of the dishes.",4

I have been looking for a cheap pork bao and this one only cost $9.99. Not a bad deal. The cafe was a bit hot, because the ceiling was low.

Maybe my Californian taste buds are whack.
We ordered the wonton soup, rib eye bao, fish fillet, and black pepper steak with mushroom rice omelet.
All from scanning the Yelp reviews and tips.
We didn't finish a third of the food because it simply wasn't doing it for us.

Honestly, the food was mediocre at best.  None of it was bad.  But no way this can be considered good.

Also, be prepared to shower and change after eating here.  You will smell like a wok.",3

Wendy even makes a point to touch every table checking on satisfaction. My daughter told me the next day she wants to go back VERY SOON! I have to agree! Thanks Wendy!

The good: this is a nice, smaller restaurant, with a very helpful & friendly wait staff. Service is very fast. The Shrimp was tasty & perfectly cooked & The Egg Plant dish was very good as well.

The not so good: The Won Ton Noodle soup was just so-so & on the plain side. As far as the Shrimp Fried Rice goes, it was okay, nothing special, much like the soup.

Why did I give Wendy's 4 Stars? As a non-Chinese person, I rarely get good or friendly service in Chinese restaurants in Vegas. This isn't a deal breaker for me, since I normally do takeout..... & I love Chinese food. Wendy's is small, clean & has great service. If I ever went out on a date, this might be my first choice for Chinese food. I know they have some good dishes, I just need to order what they do well next time.",4

Anyways, the Rice Omelet with Seafood Alfredo is delicious and good enough to make me a fan of this place!  Prices are reasonable, and the service is prompt and courteous.  Please be noted that it takes 20-30 minutes to make the Rice in clay pot because it is freshly made to order!  This place is pretty good; come try it while you are in Vegas!",4
973920,wE5lFNJICA5ZSsNXuOAzeA,2sn5BECdlYxqQlw1VODDoA,"Wendy's tastes like home cooking. It's different than a place like KJ's; this is more of a Shanghai/Hong Kong style, with a little fusion (e.g. tom yum fried rice). 

Her restaurant is clean, with very good style for an Asian restaurant. Dish presentations are good as well. And it feels homey here, too, when Wendy comes around to say hello, see how the dishes are. The servers are attentive as well.

Green beans with XO sauce
Pan fried noodles with XO sauce
Spicy Chicken
Wonton Noodle soup

All of these dishes were cooked well and were entirely flavorful. I could eat the green beans everyday, it's that good. They're crunchy with a little bit of a scorch from the wok. The pan fried noodles are rolls of noodles cut into bite sized pieces. Both of these dishes have good XO flavor. I really enjoyed the burnt chili pepper flavor of the spicy chicken, where you cook a dried chili in oil before adding the rest of the ingredients. The wonton noodles aren't mind-blowing by any means, but they hit a certain comfort spot.

If I think about past dishes I've tried here, the only thing I didn't care for was the dish with the thinner noodles, crab, and XO sauce. I felt the crab to bell pepper ratio was disproportional.",4

Being a Chinese chow spot, I'm kind of shocked that the servers are friendly! Guess I've been conditioned to the horrible service from the Chinese restaurants back home. 

The food is decently priced. Especially the appetizers (hella cheap)! A lot of which sounds delicious. 

The taste is good (not bad), some of what we've ordered is a little bland. No MSG, what gives???! :D

Ill give Wendy's 3.5 for now... I want to try all of the appetizers! 

So far my go to: their fried calamari (like their version bc it's thick cuts and less batter), spicy wings, salty fish and chicken fried rice, and that basil seed drink.

FOOD:
Chow Fun with XO Sauce (3 stars): Okay, thought it would be better. Not as much flavor as I hoped for. 

Udon Seafood with XO Sauce (4 stars): I love udon. I thought I would like the chow fun more because it looked better, but this had more flavor. 

Duck and Egg Noodle Soup (2.5 stars): Wasn't a big fan of this soup. I didn't like the broth. 

String beans with XO sauce (3.5 stars): Had to have some veggies. But again not much flavor with the sauce. 

Shanghai Dumplings (4 stars): These were good. Love how you get soupy broth in the inside, be careful not the break it when you scoop it up. 

Anyways, I don't have that much background in authentic Chinese food, but my friend does, and she thought it was just okay also. 

Service (5 stars):
The ladies were really nice and on top of our requests. One specifically looked at me, the least Asian in the group, to see if I needed a fork instead of chopsticks. Pretty funny, but I can use chopsticks just fine (=

Atmosphere:
Medium sized restaurant. Very clean. If you come with a group they have round tables with the Lazy Susan's to make it easy to share.

- Indonesian fried rice: under seasoned and cooked with frozen vegetables. But I gotta say, the chicken wings that came with the rice were bomb.
- Rice cake and ramen with beef: beef was a little chewy, overall the dish needed a little more sauce and spice. Since it's based on a Korean dish, I was expecting more kick.
- String beans with XO sauce: beans were way too old to be eaten... They were super hard so we couldn't even chew some of them.

On the plus side, they served us delicious winter melon soup before the dishes came and the service was great.",3

973928,K9hhiLN1eOBtMAXpahAfWg,2sn5BECdlYxqQlw1VODDoA,"Wendy's is a fusion-type place with a great and varied selection, but I've come to love one of the more authentic Chinese dishes! I came here with a tutoring student a year or so ago and she knew Wendy from another establishment, and I've been going back whenever I can since. I live a bit far from the location but if I can put up with the drive it can't be beat. Everything I've had here has been excellent! The only complaint I've had was actually from my aunt, who just can't seem to find Singapore Noodles to her liking here in Las Vegas. My favorite dish to get is the pan fried rice noodles with XO sauce but I've also gotten to a point where I won't eat chow mein from any other restaurant because I like how Wendy's Noodle Cafe does it the best.

Also, this might sound funny since Wendy's is primarily Chinese/Cantonese cuisine, but I hadn't found an appreciation for kimchi until I had it here with their grilled beef short ribs.

Customer service here is great, especially considering how busy it can get in the evenings. Everyone is friendly from the owner to the staff and they're really sweet about putting up with me since I drink water by the gallon whenever I eat, so kudos for that. I always get a funny look when I order dishes without bean sprouts (I've had traumatic experiences with them, I'm sorry!) There are always complimentary peanuts (that I swear taste better than any peanuts I've ever bought? Where do I get these peanuts??) and people checking in on you, even when the restaurant is a bit busier. The place is clean and has a great atmosphere, and there's a TV typically playing music shows from China/Hong Kong or Korean music videos that are quiet enough to complement rather than interrupt your meal.

I highly recommend the pan fried rice noodles with XO sauce - and ask for extra sauce on the side, if you're a fan of the taste like I am. The Korean-inspired BBQ short ribs are a good deal for their price and I honestly order all the more customizable dishes here (like noodles and rice) with chicken because it's perfectly juicy and tender and I've never encountered so much as a bite of gristle. The complaints about things being under-seasoned in other reviews are valid--I've had my share of more mild dishes here than I'm used to, but considering I can just ask for more sauce on the dish I'm obsessed with, it's never bothered me. Plus, I've got heart problems, so the less salt the better!",5

I also recommend the Portuguese curry with fried pork. 

Crispy pan fries egg noodles are delicious also.

They also have those soup dumplings.

The prices range a lot so you can get a really affordable meal while they have some things that are a little pricier.

Aside from our daughter's favorite dish, we also really like their Mango Shrimp Salad & rice in a hot pot.  The iced lemon tea always hits the spot, especially when we visit Vegas in the summer.

So was perusing yelp, late around 9pm, just dreaming and looking for wonton noodles. Didn't want dumplings or pho or ramen, just a simple bowl of wonton noodles. Thanks yelpers, you really pulled through. 

The wontons were juicy, plumb, just the right amount of pork to shrimp. The noodles were perfectly al dente. The broth was tasty. All in all it was satisfying and delish.

We also had yang chow fried rice and it was done right. Great 'wok hay' and filled with bits of BBQ pork and shrimp.

The porridge/congee/jook was the perfect consistency. The rice was broken down and smooth. This was jook done right.

The drinks are also quite good.

Will be back the next time I'm visiting vegas.",4
973934,8H9qPmwRltHsJZ5Xb-q6mA,2sn5BECdlYxqQlw1VODDoA,"This might be news to you, but I'm asian and eating fried rice sounds boring to me. I mean, I grew up on the stuff, so I can easily whip it up at home (with my eyes closed). Well, get this, my boyfriend and I decided to go out on a limb and try Wendy's ingenious Tom Yum Goong Fried Rice ($10.95). Holy freaking amazeballs #%^*!! It was incredible!

Seriously. Close your eyes and imagine this: Lemongrass+tender seafood+sweet+sour+spicy+comfort+warmth+dancing taste buds. 

Ok, now, what did you imagine? Tom Yum soup right? Right! That's what this fried rice is all about. They added a whole bunch of seafood (squid, shrimp, white fish) and they were all cooked flawlessly - moist, tender, juicy and seasoned well! They even had crispy charred bits that popped in my mouth and added explosive flavor. Also, the rice was moist and had incredible lemongrass flavor; the spices were all very flavorful. There was a raging party in my mouf! I need to thank Wendy for reawakening my love for what I thought was boring fried rice, I will forever be grateful.

The other dishes we ordered were also tasty:
- House Special Chow Mein (Crispy Noodles) with tender beef and veggies ($7.99) - Huge portion and very flavorful gravy sauce. Let's be real, the gravy sauce makes or breaks the dish, well, they seasoned it amazing here. They packed it with a lot of noodles and beef. Not too many veggies, but that's ok with us!

- Rib Eye and white shimeji roll (from the tapas menu) (about $4)- So simple, but it really surprised us. The ribeye was juicy, tender and the flavor of the meat shined! The buttery mushrooms were cooked perfectly and had a lovely buttery bite.

- Rib Eye bao burger ($9.99) - Great rib eye flavor, super fluffy and soft bao buns, and comes with a side of tangy fresh salad that tastes great when you stuff it into the bao burgers! Also try dipping it in Hoisen plum sauce for extra flavor!

- Pepper glazed spare ribs clay pot ($9.99) - this dish is a classic! It really brings me back to my childhood (Vietnamese has a same dish called ""thit kho to"" - It comes out bubbling hot and served with white rice (check out my video!) It's an explosion of sweet and salty flavor. (Note: they have lots of small bones attached, so be extra cautious when chewing/swallowing) 

- Spicy steak cubes and rice cake with ramen ($8.99) - I typically don't like rice cakes because they are too plain, filling, and bland, but my boyfriend loves them. They were cut into smaller pieces and not too chewy (that's a good thing.) The sauce was deliciously sweet, not to spicy at all in our opinion (we eat chili peppers for breakfast!) and the beef was very tender. My biggest complaint was that there wasn't enough sauce. :/

- Mung Bean, Red Bean, Jelly, Coconut Milk and crushed ice drink! ($3.99) - Yessss!!! This dessert drink was the perfect ending to our meal. I really enjoyed the mung bean, red bean, and jelly bits and texture while slurping them up with the wide boba straw. Sweet, refreshing, and cheap!

Wendy has great prices! I mean, the house special chow mein noodles is cheap! For $7.99, the amount of noodles and beef they gave us was enough for 2 starving adults to get their fill. And $4 for a icy delicious dessert drink is a nice price point if you ask me. My wallet thinks so...",5

We came in a got greeted properly. Some people on Yelp posted about the complimentary peanuts but we unfortunately  did not get any. We went through the menu and there were soooo much to choose from. They have appetizers ranging from around $5-7. As you can see,we ordered the Shanghai Dumpling. The Pepper Steak with Fried rice omelet caught my attention and ofcourse we got the Rib eye Bao Burger.

Shanghai Dumpling- more like a soup dumpling with a weird cherry like sauce on the side but I suggest dipping it in soy sauce instead:)
Pepper steak with fried rice omelet- tender steak since mine was medium with a peppery gravy like sauce while the fried rice was cooked to perfection. Good portion size as well. 
Rib eye bao burger- a bit dry but still packed with sweet bbq flavor with a really soft and moist bun. Also with a sauce if refreshing salad. 
Thai tea float- bomb as f*ck! Ask for less or no ice with extra caramel sauce.

Overall we were very full and more than satisfied with the meal. I have it four stars because the service was kind ""Bleh"" like the sever didnt ask what we wanted to drink. Our food came in and we finished it before we got the dumplings(appetizer) and no one ever checked up on us to see if we're doing okay or we need anything.

We got the tom Yong gong fried rice and it was very good as the other reviews stated. It's not your regular fried rice, it was a bit sweet, and a bit sour but the flavor was so good together. And it had a lot of seafood on it

We also got the pan fried beef noodles. The noodles were pre - fried until crispy and they pour the stir fried beef over it on top. Very flavorful and yummy. A bit salty for me but good nonetheless.

I am a big fan of clean Chinese food that are tasty and serve it purpose... We ordered 2 small dishes, first was the rib eyes bao, which use plain mantou bread and folded like a taco stuffed with sir fry rib eye w/onion!! I have to day this was a very simple but delicious dish!  The other small dish was mushroom wrapped with rib eye meat... This dish wasn't filled with much flavored but the meat was cooked right with the mushroom, a little sauce or garnish added would've made this dish a bit better... To the main course!! I usually ask for a preference of what to eat at a newly tested restaurant, the waitress kindly refer me to the seafood alfredo omelets.. This dish was amazing!! A-MAZING! The rice was fried lightly with vege and sauce, then wrapped in an egg-like omelets then hot seafood alfredo sauce poured over.. The rice absorbed the flavor of the sauce perfectly.. The dish was devoured by me within seconds!! My recommended dish for sure!  Many to try next time I am here!  :D so stop by and try there dishes!",5

The over food quality was solid. The noodles were perfectly done and the wontons were a generous size. The beef with the noodles was a little bit rough due to overcooking but that can be forgiven. The garlic pan fried bok choi on the other hand was mediocre.

We ordered roast duck comes with rice, tomato beef with rice, spicy steak cubes with instant ramen noodles and rice cake (ddukbokki), and pan fried rice cake with rice cake (ddukbokki) and egg with a vinegary soy sauce dip.

The food came out within 10-15 minutes, and we were surprised by how great everything tasted.  Nothing was too salty or underflavored, my favorites dishes were the spicy steak cubes with instant ramen noodles and rice cake, and the pan fried rice cake with chewy rice cake.  The steak cubes were tender and just slightly spicy.  Roast duck had a great crispy skin and not that much fat!!! 
The tomato beef with rice was pretty typical and tasted the same as how it usually tastes.

We keep coming here hoping it gets better, but not always. Here is what we miss:

-The high quality chili oil with ground dried shrimp. Server says too expensive to offer.
-They used to give out a small dish of peanuts as an appetizer. No longer.
-Dishes ""appear"" smaller even when the head cook is there (see below) as observed over the past few months.

For a long term customer (been coming since opening week), this is dissapointing to make these small cuts. Also, the size of the dishes are getting smaller so it seems. Perhaps it was the afternoon cook (we arrived at 5:15). We noticed the main cook arriving and the dishes for the table next to us were larger (but not as before). I asked if the Singapore Noodles can be made with rice noodles (fun) instead of rice stick noodles, the server went to ask and was told the head cook was not there so it couldn't be done. Really? You can't switch the type of noodles? What a Noodle Head! Mind you, this is not a rant over our experience yesterday, but something that has been going on.",2

Tried the Tom Yum Goon Fried Rice - that was delicious, if not a touch sweet for me. The best part? The seafood - all tender, flavorful and fresh. Everyone at the table gobbled up the delicious seafood on this dish!

The freshness of their ingredients promises some above average dishes in their soup, clay pots & desserts menus...next time! Will definitely be back to try some more exotic offerings.

Their salt and pepper shrimp tapas portion is enough for two people, but I think I prefer the salt and pepper shrimp batter from Big Wong better. I didn't care much for the rib eye bao buns, but my husband really liked them. The side salad that came along with the plate was really good and reminded me of something from Cafe Zupas.

We also ordered the ribeye bao burgers, which were three white Chinese steamed buns filled with a slightly sweet and savory meat and onion mixture. They were really easy to eat and it was hard to be nice and share them.

** ONLY EAT HERE IF THIS IS THE LAAAAST PLACE YOU CAN FIND CHINESE FOOOD**

Let me advise you why not to come here:
- first walked in, stood there and waited at the entrance for a good 6-7 minutes for someone to acknowledge my existence although 4 staff members made contact with me as well as it not being busy.

-when my family and I were seated, table next to us had seemingly waited patiently for someone to take their orders. The women and her grandma asked they can please order. The staff members never came around and so they walked out on their table. We were totally shocked.

-Service was worse than most Chinese restaurants which makes me very tolerable to bad service. But, their servers fit in the category of extreme. They give you attitude, they ignore your requests of their service even when you scream out ""hi, excuse me!"" while raising your arm. Worst of all was when everyone finished their food with the first two entrees ordered had been forgotten, the lady denied of with such a strong passion that they didn't forget about the two entrees. Six of us were all finished before the two had even got their food. No apologies, no nothing. 

-then, they asked for the check and they slapped it on the table while saying, ""gratuity is included"". No thank you, no smile, not even a slight glance before walking away. We reread the menu to double check if they ever mentioned a gratuity policy with a certain number of people. Nope! None.


-MOST IMPORTANTLY...THEIR FOOD. The Sui kaow wonton egg noodle soup was mediocre. It had only 1 choy with 5 pieces and was very small. Looked like something you can make at home. Not worth it. Seafood pan friend noodles had too much gravy which made the noodles very soggy. The egg drop beef over rice was horrible. It literally looked like a plate of rice, 7-10 small chunks of beef with scrambled egg then clear gravy poured right on top with it the whole dish being very bland. Our XO chow fun was super bland but overly covered in chilli flakes. Worst of all was finding a dried clump of vermicelli that had chili on it randomly on one of our entrees that had no no vermicelli. It means they're dirty because it was right on top when they placed the entree down.

This is not the place to go if you want a good meal and experience with very valuable family time. They wasted our time.",1

It's located inside Aria Hotel and although I've stayed at Aria several times, I've never seen this place, it's kind of hiden. Once found, I thought it was so beautiful, definitely and upscale restaurant. We of course ordered the Peking duck which was $79 and you have a choice of it being served with wraps or buns, I much prefer the buns. They brought the whole duck to our table and carved the duck skin in front of us then place them on top of the buns. It was delish, better than the ones I had in Beijing a couple of years ago. We also ordered the Braised Shark Fin Soup, which was on the chef's special menu for $148 a bowl. The fins aren't shredded, you get the whole fin, this serves one but we split it and it was fulfilling since we also ordered other items. Next was the Eggs and Dried Scallops fried rice which was about $25 and an order of Lobster with Garlic and Ginger, this was fried to perfection at $120.

990978,JP1ZdZL-Khu_sEZmVSZrUw,VnTREYYq-cquQ3f2re8iBg,"All the Yelp reviews led me here to Blossom. My partner and I were celebrating our 3.5 year anniversary, so we wanted to splurge and find a place with good eats. Everyone had something positive to say here and so we decided to check it out. We made a last minute reservation and thus, seating and dining was quite effortless from there. 

This restaurant business is tucked away from the hustle and bustle of drunks and gamblers (aka away from the slot machines and card tables). You'll know you're going the right way when you see the golden statue/fountain right out front.

We were a little hesitant to get Chinese food in Vegas, but we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and the meals at the ARIA so we decided this place had to be just as good. And we were RIGHT.

Our meal consisted of:
- the Walnut Prawns
- the Beef Chow Fun
- Stuffed Crabcakes/Meatballs (I think)
- a vegetable dish

It's been awhile since I was there so it's kind of hard for me to remember all of the details. But the Walnut Praws were my favorite part of the dinner. They were so large and succulent, my tastebuds were watering. The Crabcakes/Meatballs were very thick, but the sweet and sour sauce they added made it a lot easier to eat, and enjoyable too.

The hostess and our waiter were all excellent. They provided us with water all the time, asked us if we were okay or if we needed anything else, and so kindly wrapped our leftovers so we could take it back to the hotel room.

I'd definitely recommend this place if you want upscale Chinese food. The pricing of each dish here is rather on the more expensive side of Chinese cuisine. Expect to pay between $20-30 for each entree you decide to get. Sharing it family style makes it a lot more manageable and tastier too!

Having spent the vast majority of my life in Ohio and thus isolated from most Asian cultures save for during my travels I'm embarrassed to say that prior to relocating to Las Vegas I'd never truly realized the grandeur of the Chinese New Year, a fete celebrated by nearly 20% of the world's 6.5 billion people, but vowing to remedy this situation through both a literature search and at least a couple meals commemorating the Year of the Horse it was with good fortune that I found a friend happy to join me at Aria's highly praised Blossom on Saturday night.  Seemingly a cuisine underappreciated by many Americans, or at least most frequently enjoyed 'on the cheap,' yet one whose bold flavors I'd previously seen brought to new light by exemplary ingredients in both Toronto and New York it was just after 7:30pm when my friend and I arrived for dinner and seated at a plush two-top given full vantage of the room's center dining area it was with stellar service from a team of at least a half dozen that the night progressed; a cocktail, quartet of savories, and a single dessert plus complimentary cookies served in three courses with every plate stunning in quality, quantity, and presentation.  Starting off with a duo of creamy true/goose foie gras with pronounced sapor balanced by light pepper and seared caramelization served alongside four ""medallions"" melding concepts of Crab Rangoon and Shrimp Toast it would be difficult to name another spot in the States to find a better version of either, yet progressing to the 'main course' it was soon that round one disappeared to the ages as Chef Chi Kwun Choi's farm raised Peking Duck arrived tableside to be deftly carved and plated by a veteran service team claiming to have performed the ritual ""at least two thousand times,"" the crisp and meaty skin placed delicately on bao and in pancakes with crisp vegetable and aromatic hoisin before the rest of the bird was taken to the kitchen to be disarticulated, deboned, and presented hot, supple, and ever so rich.  Rounded out with large, lightly fried prawns and candied walnuts topped with delicately honeyed mayo over chilled winter melons and finally six small dumplings filled with silky Kahlua cream plus a duo of gifts for the table it would be easy for me to say Blossom was the best Chinese restaurant I've experienced to date but taking it one step further I'd place it amongst my ten best meals in Las Vegas; food, room, and service rivaling some of the French, Spanish, and Italian Masters at a slightly more favorable price point.",5

Everything we got was delicious. The portions weren't gigantic for the price, but everything was so good that we'd definitely go back. The atmosphere is pretty spectacular, too.

This place has some of the best Chinese food. Ample portions , good quality cuts of meat (chicken and beef is what we had)  and lots of vegetables. 

We each ordered a dish with a side of fried rice. I would recommend ordering just one dish per couple along with a fried rice dish. Everything was fresh. 

Service was absolutely outstanding. Not overly intrusive but right there when you needed some water or other amenity. Very personable and answered every question.

The hostess and wait staff are very attentive and formal- service was top notch. The ambience is serene and upscale- you know you're in for a high-end dinner.

I had the tempura fried Chilean sea bass and my girlfriend had the seafood chow mein. The sea bass was amazing- moist on the inside and lightly fried on the outside. The portion was very generous- no need for an appetizer.  The chow mein was likewise amazing- flavorful and with scallops, shrimp, fish, and squid.

We also got tempura fried string beans, which were good.

Our entire party was pleased with the quality of food we got.  We started with the tempura ice fish and the beef roll with enoki mushroom.  Both were spectacular (although how can a pile of little fried fish be anything but?).  Everyone ordered their own entree and didn't really share, but for me, the steamed sea bass on tofu was a great follow up to the heavier appetizers.  The sauce sufficiently allowed the sea bass to shine through.  The fish itself was perfectly flaky.  The tofu added more substance to the dish while not making it heavy.  Can't think of any way to improve this one!  

The service was also impeccable.  We were never waiting for drinks and the waiter was always right there if we had a question or wanted to order something.  Even though he was very attentive, he didn't hover.  

All in all, a great experience and a pleasant surprise.  If you are looking for some authentic Chinese food and don't want to venture off the strip, add Blossom to your list of options.  You won't be disappointed.",5

He's matured so much over the years and I'm happy to share my love of food with him. It's something he's definitely come to appreciate. He used to eat nothing but chicken fingers and BBQ cheeseburgers. Now, he can find the value in a good meal and I respect his willingness to try new things. 

Blossom receives little attention, yet reviews for the restaurant are pretty solid. Prices are steep, but in line with other fine dining Chinese restaurants. The restaurant has a lovely quiet ambience tucked away near Baccarat. Service was attentive. The Restaurant Week menu offered dinner for $50.14, we were started with Wor Wonton soup, then we had the choice of Pot Stickers or Shrimp Toast for appetizers, followed by entree selections of Crisp Fried Chilean Sea Bass or Beef Tenderloin with Portabella Mushroom, served with Pork Fried Rice. Dessert was Mochi Ice Cream. 

We sampled all that was available. The Wor Wonton soup had large shrimp, scallop and two wontons with broccoli and mushrooms. The broth lacked depth, flavor improved with a spoonful of garlic sriracha. 

The Potstickers were large and nicely prepared, but it was the Shrimp Toast that were memorable. Each bite was so buttery it seemed to melt in your mouth. It was a pleasant surprise. 

Chilean Sea Bass is my second favorite fish, so I was very excited to dig in. The filet was deep fried and it had a nice tempura crust, but I found it unfortunate that the breading overwhelmed the natural flavor of the fish. Still, it was beautifully presented. The BBQ Pork Fried Rice was nicely done, but the flavor was a bit mild for my taste. Another spoonful of sriracha, gave it the kick it needed. The Bok Choy was fresh and tender. The Beef Tenderloin was bursting with flavor from the black pepper marinade. It was a tasty dish.

Dessert concluded our meal with Mochi Ice Cream, Green Tea and Mango were the flavors. I usually enjoy green tea ice cream, but the mango was a strong favorite. It was light with bold refreshing flavor. The Mochi was chewy without being too gummy. When asked how he enjoyed his meal, my brother replied, ""It's fucking weird, but I like it."" Just like that another foodie is born. 

Blossom was a great choice for Restaurant Week, it's not likely a restaurant I would have chosen otherwise. However, it was a nice treat and it left me drooling over their peking duck and dungeness crab on the regular menu.",4

The restaurant looks beautiful and it really sets the mood for an intimate dinner. Waiters and guest are most definitely at the top of their etiquette. Table setting was decent to me and their menu look beautiful. However, when opening their menus, I was blown away that their menu wasn't entirely expensive. Yes, they do have dishes that cost between $50-$200, but they also have a wide variety of dishes between $10-$40. I went to this restaurant with a few other people and we decided to eat family style. We ordered a bunch of rice dishes like Walnut Prawns, Clams, Bok Choy, Choy Sum, Seabass, Duck, Beef Tendon, Duck Tongue, and Fried Rice. I had to say though, the presentation of the dishes was not all that great. They seemed to just placed the food on the plates and bring them out to the table. Plus, they did not clean the plates before serving.....what kind of high end restaurant doesn't clean their plates?!? The portions were small, but it was expected. Now the food, it didn't have the flavors that stuck out to me, in fact, a lot of dishes tasted bland to me. The only dish I actually enjoyed was the duck, I was actually surprised that this dish wish tasty and the texture was just right. Overall, if I am going to pay hundreds of dollars to eat an expensive restaurant, I'm going to need more than a fancy setting, I want my food to actually look and taste good. Don't think I'll ever come back. (But it's not like casinos care if you come back cause they continuously have customers year-round....just saying)",3

They wanted to seat us at a 6 person table. Mind you the restaurant was EMPTY! So then I find out we have two more adults coming and ask for a bigger table. They were hesitant but allowed us to seat in the ""VIP"" room. 
At first I though nice. Private room. Wrong!  Private room is like a round padded jail cell. Just barely big enough to fit the big table and the chairs around it. Not only that but it was nearly impossible to get any service in that room. I guess VIP stands for very invisible people. 
When we finally got a hold of a server and asked for something we would have to wait about 25 mins with no result and have to frantically flag another server. 
They got three stars solely because the spicy water fish dish was AMAZING!! So good we ordered two. Yes the second one took forever yet again to flag someone down and ask if we can order from our server. 
Also. Server was Korean and did not speak chinese. Now that to me does not make sense. It's a Chinese restaurant. I would like sometimes to order in Chinese. Only because I only sometimes know things in Chinese. Anyhow. I thought that was interesting. But I would ace let it slide if he was nicer and attentive. But neither was the case.

The duck was served with skin and meat and sauce on a wrap. Ummm. It should be served with skin only? The skin is not crispy enough. The sauce is ok. After that the duck was brought back to chop. The meat was juicy but have a bit of distinct smell of the duck. Overall, the Peking duck is better than other places in So cal like duck house.

I was just about to go back in and see if it was ready when at the same time, the guy was bringing it out to my car. We exchanged our thanks, and we were on our way.

1004650,_VgN2v4S25Xt4se9UMtvCw,PGkKmZIK_tCMbLPy1BRwMg,"Whenever I eat Chinese (and by Chinese I mean western style take out food) I pretty much always get the same thing

-Crab Rangoon (cream cheese wantons)
-Sweet and Sour Chicken
-Pork fried rice


So my review is based solely on these items. Most of the deduction came from the crab rangoons although overall the meal was aggressively mediocre.

Crab Rangoon

A good CR should be crispy on the outside, and stuffed full of moist, gooey cream cheese and fake crab meat. The ration of filling to pastry should be such that there is barely enough pastry to hold the filling inside and no more. These CRs have way too much pastry and not enough filling. This produces a CR that is really dry and no matter how much sweet and sour sauce you slather it in (as a professional slatherer I should know) the taste/texture is never quite right. In addition, unclear if this is because of too much pastry, the whole thing was very very dry- no delicious moistness. 

Sweet and Sour chicken

Getting take out SSC has a few pitfalls
-if they mix the sauce beforehand the chicken will be way to wet/not crispy
-if they don't mix there is a chance the steam from the dish will make everything inside mushy
-they can have vegetables mixed in

This one was actually dec. The chicken wasn't super crisp but they wisely did not premix the sauce so it was salvageable.

Pork Fried Rice
Not enough egg , but other than that acceptable.",3

While online ordering can be convenient, I prefer to call since you end up spending 10 minutes online entering your order and CC info anyways.  When I came to pick up, the place was nearly empty, and the younger boy at the counter (I'm guessing a family member) was arguing with one of the other employees (probably another family member).  He was also not very friendly, handing me my receipt without saying thank you or come again or anything at all.  He's just a kid though so not too surprising.

- orange chicken/ steam rice
- Mongolian beef/ pork fried rice
- egg drop soup
- won ton soup
- egg rolls


Best thing about the orange chicken was that they used actual orange peel in the marinade, other than that, it was chewy and needed seasoning possibly a bit of sweetness and crunch.
Mongolian beef was also lacking flavor and too chewy, as if it was the same protein from 3 days prior. Not at all spicy as it claimed to be and was covered in onions.
Pork fried rice was decent. I'd order this again.
Egg drop soup was also tasty and glad it wasn't salty.
Won ton soup broth was delicious, but a bit salty and the won tons were definitely pre frozen and the pork inside the won ton was rubbery and tasted like jerky. Who knows how long they've been stored.
Egg rolls were yummy, although the ingredients inside were questionable, but good.

My wife and I have been eating at New York Chinese for almost three years now, and I have never been disappointed in the food or the service.  Now, I've read reviews here on both sides of the middle saying ""I'm from New York and I know what New York-style food is all about ..."" and then one review says that this or that restaurant makes the best food that's ever been cooked, and the other review says it's not fit to feed your pet.  Amidst all the confusion, let me state that the Great Bearded Bird has never been to New York, either city or state, so I can only go on what I like.

Also, in the interest of FULL disclosure, I will state that I have only purchased food for take-out once.  All the remainder of my experience with this establishment has been of the ""eat-in"" variety.

The food has always been top-notch.  What should be crisp, has been crisp.  What should be savory, has been.  Never a complaint on their preparations.

Service has always been outstanding, even when the place is crowded.  (With only eight tables, crowded comes easy.)  The people are always nice.  Story from today ...

For a number of reasons that don't need to be gotten into at this time, it's been about eight months since we've been there.  Always meaning to, and always something comes up.  Today, we go.  We get there, we order our usual (no matter how many times we go, we almost always order the same things), and we sit down and wait.  One of the staff, a darling young lady named Michelle, sees us (she's waited on us many times), says ""hi!"" and comes over to touch base.  She tells us she's missed us and how glad she is to see us to know that we're all right.  Now, just exactly how many other places do you get that kind of greeting, even if you HAVE been gone a while?

Food: 4-amd-a-half of 5.

I must say that I am disappointed also, the smell inside the restaurant kind of had a stitch of either sewage or old mop water. I will not be returning here. It wasn't at all what I was hoping for. Disappointed...",1
1004660,shAFKBijdm09tc1xb5hhNA,PGkKmZIK_tCMbLPy1BRwMg,I love the Wor Wonton soup. I always get it when I feel a cold coming on and it really helps me feel better.,4

1004662,iymzFQbrucNRQMvpQ0gn3Q,PGkKmZIK_tCMbLPy1BRwMg,"Well this used to be our family's favorite chinese restaurant in the city until the spring  of 2014. We have tryed going back after the 1st bad experience 4 more times and we were so disappointed I felt compelled to write this review. I will tell you all the problems that we encountered.
1. Family dinner and there was a hair in our main entree. I noticed none of the cooks were wearing hair nets. I took the plate of food with the hair up to show the manager and told him we cannot eat this and he made us pay for it even after he took the plate and he clearly saw the hair.
2. Decided to try again. This time we were almost done when I cut my mouth from a hard piece of plastic that was in my food. My husband took the dish with the plastic up to the manager again he clearly saw the plastic and again made us pay for our meal.
3. They say the 3rd time is a charm, well not so. Again we found black hair in the entree did the same as always showed the manager the plate with the hair and as always he made us pay for the meal even tho we did not eat the food. We were beyond grossed out by now. Again no hair nets were being worn by the cooks.
4. I guess we don't learn but we decided one more try. We arrived and noticed that the place was empty not one customer in the restaurant. Once we opened the door and walked in we immediately realize why. The place smelled so bad like bad sour pork. It was the most disgusting smell we walked right out.
This place used to be so excellent. Don't know what happened but we will never ever step foot in there again and it really needs to be reported to the health inspectors. So  the moral of this review is stay away. It's not worth getting cut by plastic in your food and grossed out by hair in the food. The owners need to implement hair nets and much better working stations so foreign objects are not in the food they are serving.",1
1006725,qExD2KBPZCTLFpoEN-jopg,fJX4coaMuEwipbQlkhskWQ,I chose this place because it is so close to my home. Unfortunately the food was not good at all. Not much taste and the sesame chicken was super tough. The lo mein was okay. And the wontons were pretty bland and a little softer than other places. I will not be eating here again. I threw most of it away.,2
1006726,JMzK7mzs_sU2yVOfvmuMxQ,fJX4coaMuEwipbQlkhskWQ,"Always great service!!
I personally got to know the original owners! But these guys are equally great people! Service is always good! The food?  I love it!! Specially the Lomis! Never gets old to me! I'll eat Lomi any day! You guys gotta try it!!!",5
1006727,2-tHd07-5Qh7qtIW7QoaKg,fJX4coaMuEwipbQlkhskWQ,"This place is a definite MUST SKIP.

I ordered a Wonton Soup and a White Rice. Pretty simple, walked in expecting to pay 5, maybe 6, at most 7 dollars. Final Bill was 9.70!! For, that's right folks, white rice and wonton soup.

Ok, maybe I'm being too critical, maybe this soup is full of fresh wontons in a very good broth. WRONG, this crap had maybe 3 or 4 mushy, disintengrating wontons which made the broth cloudy and mushy. On top of that it was at least half full of nothing but chopped cabbage.

And the rice was too wet, serious Chinese food nubs working here.

9.70 for:
-Half a quart of cabbage
-Four Mushy Wontons
-Cloudy Mushy Broth from probably sitting wontons
-Wet Rice

Do the math!

Glad I paid $10 for a meal that probably cost then a quarter. First and LAST time eating at Pumi Express!",1

I don't understand why people would rather eat here. there's so many other Chinese places to go. oh one thing... They do have some extraordinary delicious egg rolls. I have to give them that. I don't know what they do to them, but their egg rolls are freakin delicious possibly the best I've had. it's still not enough to give them more stars but it's worth mentioning.",2

How do you mess up a teriyaki bowl? Well for starters you find the oldest driest chicken and you dry it out some more, then you take two parts teriyaki to one part rice and make sure the rice can swim. Then you add enough garlic to wipe out all the vampires that ever existed twice over and then double it to make sure. To top it off they got my drink order wrong too. Save yourself a headache  and if you're a vampire run for your life.",1

Couldn't understand my order and charged me for something I didn't order!  Wow! If I was the manager she would be gone gone gone!

I find when I get frustrated there now its because of the fool in front of me who spent their time in line chatting on their cell phone and now want extra time to decide rice/noodles? chicken/beef? 1 entree or 2? ... you get the idea.  

There's also super friendly asian guy who didn't used to work here and seems to have made things better.  He's a bit overbearing but at least he keeps the others moving quickly.

Take it for what it is - fast food.  Not the best meal you'll ever have but certainly not the worst.",3

They noticed me right away when I walked in through the door. She was helping another guest and told me she will be with me shortly. Then I see someone standing who looks like a manager or a chef.. Not sure, lol. I thought he was just going to look at me and walk away but nope. He asked if I was ready to order. And he took my order instead. I'm pretty sure they hired new people since the bad reviews. Anyways, food was great! As well as customer service. I ordered the shrimp walnut thingy and my favorite mushroom chicken and did a combo of fried rice and noodles. He put a lot on my plate. Sometimes Panda Express can be stingy with their food. Just like McDonalds and their sauce. But they started charging for those. Very irrelevant... Lol. But my review!!!(:",5
1031808,HBtOPKAHdiPRmLLKqJRNJA,3trWuWYn8gv3bieAXrBToQ,I rarely come to Panda Express but for some particular reason I was craving it..now orange chicken and honey glazed shrimp with fried rice was my choice oh and veggie rolls!!! The flavors were exceptional if weren't for all that soy sauce..just saying if the soy sauce wasn't so strong the chicken and shrimp I would've enjoyed more. I'll keep going back but not often just every now and then when I get the craving for it.,3
1031809,aHYy5C9Q3uquCpHVfOOU_Q,3trWuWYn8gv3bieAXrBToQ,I think some people expect too much from a fast food joint. I have never encountered any problems with Panda Express. I have been going to Panda for almost 10 years. Great quality of food for a reasonable price. Consistency lacks on some items such as their egg rolls. It is not always fresh. Employees are friendly enough that they offer you to try some sample of their new items.,4
1031810,pEYEvVDP2ObBlLFh3Pu7Qg,3trWuWYn8gv3bieAXrBToQ,"Before I begin, I would like to say that I normally have a great experience at Panda Express.  The food is already prepared and waiting, so if you're in a hurry, it's a decent fast food option.  Also, the workers are generally friendly and competent.

My experience at this particular Panda Express last night however will definitely make me rethink returning.

While waiting in line at the Panda Express counter I was watching the cook on duty cleaning and what I assume was degreasing the kitchen equipment and flooring.  

One of the guests ahead of me took all of one of the food items and the manager who was serving turned and asked the cook to prepare more.  This is when the issue arose.  

The cook put his cleaning supplies down and immediately went to work without washing his hands.  I witnessed him grab raw broccoli from a large container with his bare hands, then he reached into a drawer cooler to pull out raw meat, again with his bare hands.  After retrieving the ingredients, he wiped his hands on the sides of his pants and then walked down to the end of the kitchen.  On his way, he stopped to push garbage down into the trash can (literally pushed the garbage down to compress it with his bare hands).  Next, he proceeded into the back area of the kitchen where he smacked a coworkers behind.  

Without washing his hands, he returned to the cooking area while picking his nose and, after flicking whatever he found, began to cook (again, without washing his hands).  

I brought the issue up to the manager and she simply offered to have him cook something fresh for me if I was concerned about the quality of the food that was already prepared.  She was not concerned about the cross contamination of the unprepared meats and veggies and didn't seem to care that he didn't wash his hands before returning to cooking from cleaning floors and equipment.

Needless to say, I didn't go ahead with my order and ended up leaving without making a purchase.  I hope that it was just a one-time lapse, or they are going to have some sick customers to deal with very soon!",1
1031938,83TsMmDeGW-c9XIV5quTSA,5n4rqpX_xQHlcRMsbLdOrw,Every time I have gone here the food was greasy and a bit too old.

I felt like Clara from the old Wendy's commercials, ""Where's the beef?""  The dogs did enjoy it.  The egg rolls were less than average as was the kung po chicken, I swear the chicken was spongy.  We used to go to the location on Lake Mead occasionally but not for years so don't know if that one went downhill also.  The one positive note is we did not get sick.  Of course, we didn't eat much of it either.",1

1033878,mH9vGiVWM8FOcRx_k-0-Pw,s-OomSmBbKJnAkPvCuXFgA,"This place claims ""no msg,"" which is great. However, they most likely use a lot of soy sauce to compensate, which must be why many of their dishes have a browner sauce or tint. Fried rice is super brown! I'm used to a reddish Szechwan, theirs was brown. Moo shi chicken; way too brown, lacked fried egg, skimpy itsy bitsy chicken pieces, & too many mushrooms. BUT, hot n sour soup & egg drop are good for a hole in the wall take out joint. Shrimp dishes aren't skimpy, big shrimp! Nothing was too salty. I stopped in 5 min before closing just for an egg drop soup & had to wait 10 min; NOT complaining, I watched him make it FRESH! Good to know they're not reusing old soup! On another visit, they gave me a free 2 liter for my order over $30 (I think.) That's a helluva perk! If u live close, go for it. Rice n Noodle on Rainbow was my fav but I moved so this will have to do & I'm ok with that.",4

Nothing wrong with that, but just know that there is no (or little) décor and the service is done by the counter person as they have a chance.

The soups are great.  Love the War Wonton.  It is a meal in itself.  The spare ribs are very tasty.  The low miens are good as is the General Tso's chicken.

When we want take out Chinese, this is where I go.",4
1033881,QkKBXWpQ4uDcO405ZDpCDA,s-OomSmBbKJnAkPvCuXFgA,"This place was like a ghost town when I walked in. But that's ok on account of my general dislike of people. It was clean and after rubbing sleep out of her eyes, the lady behind the counter greeted me.

I'd like to preface this part of my review by letting ya'll know how much I hate onions. I can not convey enough how disgusting I find white onions, green onions, red onions, leeks, chives, scallions or anything in the onion family. (It's really hard to order most foods but I digress.) I give the menu a rundown and notice that it's less expensive than most chinese take out places and the cheap ass inside me smiles. I order the lunch special ($5.75!) and a side of lo mein. Then I give the lady my No Onions Please speech. She's like, ""Oh no problem, we don't put onions in our food."" I swear to you, the heavens opened up and and a chorus of angels started singing ""Hallelujah"". You have no idea how rare this is. People put onions in EVERYTHING. But not this place apparently.

So while I'm mentally planning my wedding here, the lady tells me it'll be a five minute wait, which is slightly optimistic, in my opinion. 15 minutes later my food comes out but I'm not even bothered by the amount of time it took since I was still on my onionless high. And the food was delicious. 

So yeah, I'll be back and I recommend, this place to anyone who likes cheap tasty chinese food. I especially invite my fellow Onion Haters to try this place. They get us.",4
1033882,3doDvC4zXItnVNQycfGfUA,s-OomSmBbKJnAkPvCuXFgA,"Close to home, flavors are ok but the sweet and sour pork has way to much doughy breading on it, it would be so much better crispy or even a light coating of batter. It felt like I was eating pork doughnuts. The fried rice seems prepared in advanced with not to much going on flavor wise. The wonton soup and general tso's chicken is good, and the place is quick and convenient. Lunch specials for $5.75 is a killer deal.",3

I was pleased that China One added a variety of vegetables to the chicken in hot garlic sauce:  bell pepper, jalapeño, carrots, onion, wood ear mushroom, white mushroom, and I think a snow pea or two snuck in there.  The dish was stir-fried to order and served piping hot.  My lunch came with egg drop soup, half chow mein, half fried rice, and a little dish of fried won ton wrappers and sweet dipping sauce.  Employees checked on me three times to see if I wanted more iced tea.  Solid food.  Solid service.  Not bad for under $9 including drink with refills.",4

If yiu dont like seafood (like me) you can get the hot and aour soup with only pork which is soooo good. They deliver so fast.

There is a certain taste, a tang, for every single dish that is served here. The food is consistent, but just okay. Not good, not great! Plus, the chow mien is super greasy every time! But all dishes just fill you up really. It's fast food--it made me not want to eat for a day!! 

If you're trying to eat healthfully, don't stoop to Panda Express! Go next door to subway, because PE is just too greasy to be healthy :P 

This location is not that busy. There are no super long lines, and the place is clean because not a huge number of people visit! Also, the staff is welcoming and friendly. Sometimes they get sidetracked, but it's not too long of a wait time.

1043097,3JPHrKMtOD6rIS4S8Juc_A,3RKhnCtiN6jfaSbJU-9kmA,"First, we usually enjoy Panda Express: and over the last few years, have eaten at MANY different locations in both Las Vegas and other cities. We understand that the POOR experience we had here is because of ignorant franchise owners at a single location and not a reflection on Panda Express in general. Nevertheless, we learned the hard way not all Pandas are created equal!

UGHHHH. Unfortunately, we made the mistake of trying this Panda Express because it was very close to the doctor's office where my 94 year old Mom had an appointment.

It was about 3 o'clock in the afternoon...well after lunchtime and before dinner. There was nobody eating there, but EVERY table was DIRTY with crumbs, noodles, spilled soda, etc.It was disgusting. We couldn't find ONE clean table to sit at. I went up to the food line to ask someone if they could wipe down a table and was ignored for at least a good 2-3 minutes by the manager and three members of the cooking staff who seemed to be very busy talking at top volume in Spanish. Finally, a woman with a name tag that said ""Manager"" came up to me thinking I was ordering food and barked, ""What do you want?"" I answered, ""We'd like a clean table to sit, can you wipe off a table for us?"" She seemed annoyed, ""Give me a minute."" FIVE more minutes passed as she proceeded to leave us standing and waiting (a 94 year old woman on a walker) as her loud conversation and laughing with employees continued.

I had to ask her one MORE time AGAIN if we could please have a clean table . Finally she begrudgingly came over with a wet wash rag to wipe. I asked her if she was the manager to which she replied in a challenging tone, ""No, I am the assistant, why?"" I said, ""Because all the tables in your restaurant are dirty. Don't you think you might have more business if you didn't have to leave customers standing and waiting several minutes to sit at a clean table?"" 

Oh, she didn't LIKE that. She gave me the stink eye and walked away. We should have just LEFT at that point, but unfortunately didn't. After wiping ONE table for us, she retreated back behind the food line and continued blabbering away with employees in Spanish, apparently comfortable to continue leaving all the other tables in the restaurant dirty.

When we finally went to order, half of the selection trays looked almost empty and dried out. They acted annoyed that some of our order choices required them to cook fresh. My mom only wanted a water to drink, so we got her a water cup. The second time the caregiver took my mom's water cup over to the drink bar for a refill, she put ice tea in it. The ""Manager"" noticed right away and came over scolding her,"" Those cups are for water only, you'll need to pay for that tea!""

Yeah,they can leave customers standing around and waiting ten munites before they can be bothered to come and wipe down a dirty table, but a 94 year old woman drinking a tea she didn't pay for...IMMEDIATE response. SCREW you, Panda Express! BOO HISS! 

BTW...we paid them the $1.72 they demanded for my mom's tea.

The last part of our negative experience here actually happened while we were eating. We started to slowly become aware of the odor of sour mop and garbage. The longer we stayed, the more noticeable it became. Determined it was coming from BOTH of the inside garbage cans in the restaurant which were filled to the brim (No customers in the place, but too busy to wipe off tables and empty the trash). We can only conclude that from the smell, when they DO empty the trash, they don't bother to clean or sanitize the liner pails. GROSS!

I CAN report that none of us experienced any sickness or food poisoning as a result of our meal here. When we left, that was a concern in the back of my mind. If you are considering eating at Panda Express, you will be much more pleased to drive five more minutes to the location at Durango and 215. That Panda Express knows what they are doing. They have consistently fresh food, a clean and pleasant interior, and really friendly employees that really care about your meal.",1

If you're planning to eat here, or really intent on eating here...I would say that their best out of all dishes would be the chicken teriyaki. 

On my plate, I had the chicken, noodles, and shrimp tempura. All of it was painstakingly dry and not very well seasoned. None of it was really that warm either. I'm probably not ever going to eat here again. On the plus side, the people working here were very polite and nice!

I've never found that to be the case at this location or even the one on North Rainbow.  I've been eating here for years and I have come to expect consistently good food and service.  It is not uncommon for me to go into China A Go Go, place a to go order and be offered a complimentary beverage while I wait.  It never takes terribly long either. 10 or 15 minutes max.  I am always pleased with the amount of food I get.  I am sure to never go hungry when eating here.  My usual order(s) are mushu chicken, orange chicken, garlilc chicken, beef with brocoli or mongolian beef.  Sometimes I'll get a noodle dish like chicken chow fun or Singapore curry noodles.  Everything I ever get is always good.  From time to time I do get egg foo young.  This was never my favorite Chinese dish growing up as I do not care for eggs 9 times out of 10.  But here is different.  I love the egg foo young and its the gravy that makes it.  That stuff would make an old show taste good.  Not that the egg foo young tastes like an old shoe.  Its good on its own but stellar with the gravy.  I just want to make that clear.  The point is I've never had a bad experience here.  I've got my dad hooked on it and my grandparents really liked it too when I treated them to dinner after they drove me home from SoCal when Grey Hound over booked their bus and I could not get on.  Argh!  But that is another story in and of itself.  Lets bring the focus back to China A Go Go.

I always get the family dinner with fried rice, hot and sour soup, Kung pao chicken, and beef and broccoli. Their house special chicken is good too, it's like general tsao's chicken or spicy orange chicken. It also comes with a couple egg rolls and rangoons. After tax it's like $29 bucks and can feed a lot of people. If you split them up into Panda Express boxes they'd fit 4 meals generously.


The food is always fresh and good. Idk how authentic ""Chinese"" it is is but it is the perfect hang over food for me lol",4
1103314,QR-aLuAPV1_tmYw5pZDXKQ,3bwxfBvKABepxYWGz3pHXA,"My wife is one of the pickiest eaters I've met, but for some reason she loves the vegetable chow mein here and the spring rolls. Now, I've had both, the chow mein is forgettable to say the lease and I'm pretty sure the egg rolls are just frozen from 7-11 or something. But, she loves it and I'll get her whatever she wants. 

On the nights she's craving her chow mein and spring rolls, I just get an order of their egg flower soup and a side of rice, i mix them together and add a little low sodium soy sauce and a healthy dose of sriracha. It's very good and filling and cheap.

There isn't much more I can say about the place, it's cheap, quick chinese food. It's a little more expensive then panda express and a little better, but don't expect gourmet. I'd say it falls somewhere between panda and p.f. changs, but a lot closer to panda express.

Even the lunch specials were very good size, 2 could share that meal. The service was nice and they were very attentive with refills.

I ordered the Beef in Oyster sauce and it not only took forever to come out but it was so salty it was almost inedible. If I hadn't gone all the way back to my hotel before eating I would have taken it back. The amount of food I got wasn't a good value at this price either, if I would have paid the $5.50 it would have been a little less mad. 

They also acted like they didn't want to take my cash since it was such a big hassle. For me to have to wait over 10 minutes for one dish when the restaurant wasn't even that packed is ridiculous.

After 10 PM you can order off the lunch specials menu, which means you can choose from 69 items priced between $5.50 and $7.50! Seriously, it's not a joke...I actually thought it was when Nelson Q first told me about it so I had to come check it out for myself.

We ordered a bunch of dishes for our table full of Yelpers, including: sweet and sour spareribs, chicken wings, sacha beef and vermicelli pot, XO spring beans, a couple of noodle dishes. All of our dishes were tasty and flavorful and I downed multiple bowls of rice along with them. The dishes are served in family style portions as you would expect with a standard Chinese restaurant, which means we had leftovers that we turned into a mix plate.

Service here was mediocre, but given that it's a traditional Chinese restaurant, you shouldn't come here expecting great service anyways. It was late when we arrived (around 11 PM) and it seemed like they were in a hurry to get us to order even though we were waiting for others to arrive. Wonder why that was because they're open super late as far as I know...Overall the food was great and we left extremely full and happy. I will definitely be back soon.",4

But, if the stomach discomfort wasn't bad enough the ladies bathroom is 1) disgusting with a barely functional toilet and 2) like something out of a horror flick with burned out light bulbs and inadequate light to see without using my cell phone flash light.

- The meal also comes with free (Chinese pot of) hot tea, which I forego and instead get/drink just ice water.

We ordered family style - 

Crispy noodles with seafood - the noodles and veggies were good, but I found the calamari a bit fishy. 
Eggplant and tofu with garlic sauce hot pot - this had great flavor and liked how the tofu surface soaked up the sauce quite a bit
General Chicken - this was actually really tasty. It was prepared in a way that reminds me more of sweet and pungent than most places Tso's and has a nice light crisp to it. 
Salt and Pepper Shrimp - these were cooked to a crisp to where you can eat the shell and all. I can eat a lot of these. 
Greens steamed with garlic - simple but good. Gotta have some veggies. 

It fed 5 people well for under $50 - not bad! I did appreciate that items weren't as greasy as some other Chinese spots open late.

Being able to order from the lunch menu after 10 pm is a clear selling point for me. $7.50 or less for each dish, plus they give generous sharing sized portions is unheard of and an extreme bargain!

Ok, so maybe we ordered a little too much for the both of us. But, we honestly didn't expect the portions to be so generous! Next time, one item and possibly an appetizer or soup would be more than enough. 

Here's what we ordered:
General Chow's chicken $7.50 (flavor rating 4/5)
Hong Kong style crispy noodles $7.50 (flavor rating 3/5)
Eggplant with garlic sauce pot $7.50 (flavor rating 3/5)
Veggie egg rolls $5.50 (flavor rating 2/5)

Out of everything we ordered, the General Chow's chicken was the most flavorful. The rest of the dishes we're sort of lacking seasoning and flavor. They were not excellent and they were not disgusting, I would say they were average. The value and the amount of food they give you is the reason to keep coming back!

The place is nice the food was pretty descent, not great. The server couldnt describe any of the sauces which made it difficult to decide what to order...they have a massive menu. Im not critiquing there service in any way....but solely on their food. We ordered the scallops in sechuan sauce and creamy shrimp with walnuts. First the scallop dish...i thought the flavors were ok. The dish was really spicy which i like...i wish it was seasoned a little better because i found it a little bland. But thats just my preference. The big negative about this dish were the scallops themselves. They were really rubbery and overcooked. Next were the creamy shrimp with walnuts...im still not sure what i think about this dish. Nice size rockshrimp battered and fried with a mayonnaise based sauce and slighly candied walnuts on a bed of shredded ice burg lettuce. the sauce is confusing to me. The flavors were ok except that i kept tasting mayo...im not saying it was bad but it was a weird combination of mayo shrimp and white rice. All in all i would go back to try some other dishes. because there was so much on the menu i was overwhelmed...btw service was good.",3

The white folks I know seem to be pretty divided on whether it's a good thing or a bad thing when the vast majority of the patrons of a restaurant order food in a language other than English.  One camp argues that the food is more authentic in these establishments.  The other group is downright scared.  With that in mind, some of my friends would be terrified...but don't worry... HK Seafood Garden has a welcoming staff, they serve several American friendly dishes such as Sweet and Sour Chicken, and they'll even offer you a fork if you seem out of place.

I recently came in with a group that ordered entirely in Chinese.  That happens often with me these days...the best part was that one of individuals from our table took it upon themselves to walk back to the kitchen, check the cleanliness, and later returned after we ordered to let the chef know not to mess up our order.  

If you ask for it, they will bring out house soup for your table.  HK has one of the better versions of this soup that I've tried.

I've enjoyed most of what I've shared here a great deal.  Some of my favorites include:
Scallops with string beans in spicy xo sauce!
Ong Choy w/ Bean Curd
House Special Stir Fried Thick Noodle
ChaoZhou Shrimp
Whole Fried Fish
Dried Scallop & Mushroom w/ Snow Pea Leaf

I have tried number of the dishes here and never been disappointed.  The drunken noodles with seafood combination is a spicy and savory dish that hits the spot.  I am a big fan of the curries here.  The red curry with seafood combination and the duck curry are excellent as well.  The soups are very delicious and sooth the body well if one is feeling sick or under the weather.

Yes the wait can be long sometimes but they are actually cooking your food fresh so be patient. 
I have tried yellow and red curry so far and they were both good. Also crab fried rice was awesome. Papaya salad is good too.

Khua Kai: My current favorite item on the menu. If you've never had it before its like a seared noodle dish with egg, served with a Thai sweet chili sauce. LOVE IT! 

Three Companion: The pork had a charred, barbecue flavor, it was a little chewy, but it's pork.

Panang Avocado Curry: This used to be my favorite menu item, (I've ordered this about 20 times) but sadly something has changed either with the quality of the Salmon or the preparation of it. I would not recommend ordering it. The salmon is consistently bad quality or dry tasting.  I asked and they said there was no change. Tried it three more times before finally giving up on it.

[DECOR]
I love the decor here. It's a very small cozy restaurant, there is this amazing faux tin ceiling which is my favorite thing about the decor here. I find myself looking up. I like that they pay Thai television here too. The walls have are half stone. Very beautiful in a casual environment.

I have been to both locations. I stopped going to the other because of sanitary reasons. I saw the dude cooking on the wok sneeze in to his hand, then continue cooking. I asked the waitress and she said, ""no he did not"" ... OK ... gross.

Then here ... previously, cheap and decent Thai food.

Until this week. Ordered food ... it came, the pot sticklers which are usually excellent were dripping grease and covered/swimming in sauce. Not a good start. The soup and salad came, and so did a little friend walking across the floor.  Actually not so little. A roach in the middle of the dining room. When I went to the manager/cashier about it, she said they have no problems - they spray all the time. I said then what about the roach in the middle of the restaurant, she said it must have come from outside. (After leaving the business, not one roach, anywhere.) I find this very hard to believe when on previous experience I had health concerns with their other location - in fact, I just learned the other location was temporarily closed by the Southern Nevada Health District last month. I think it is time for an inspection of this location as well.

For what it is worth, I offered to pay, I kept asking how much do I owe you - I kept asking, again, kept asking - yet she was on a very long conversation in Thai (I assume with an owner) about the roach issue. She did not make me pay, which in all honesty is what should have been offered in the beginning, since we did not eat and we were interrupted by pests.",2

Overall, the prices are great, the portions are huge, and most dishes taste great!",4

We ordered chicken satay for appetizer, tasty and sliced beef flat noodles with bok choy, barbecue pork wonton rice noodle soup, seafood crispy noodle with wonton with gravy, and gold/silver noodle with chicken and shrimp.  All had big portions except for the gold/silver noodle which was smaller than before.  Prices are reasonable for what you get!",4

It's a bit small but most of the time the place is vacant

I ordered the bbq Chicken over fried rice and it is one of my fav dish on the menu. It's delicious with the sauce!! ($6.95)
Rating- 8.9

Also I got the Panang curry spicy 5. I wish there was more green peppers and meat rather than sauce. It's enough to fill one to two people. ($6.95)

Definitely give this plAce a try if you're into thai food :)",3

I was really craving  Asian food and my friend mentioned that he was getting Thai food. I rushed to Archie's since I LOVE their basil fried rice. It's amazing, but sadly they were closed. There are a bunch of Thai restaurants in this area, but this was the only name I remembered, so I decided to try it. I ordered Pork Pad Thai and Chicken fried rice. I ordered take out and my food came out pretty quickly. The service wasn't that great. Typically whenever I order to go, other places always offer me water, this place did not. They also did not offer me a place to sit. I just sat down. Maybe I just have different expectations? 

Their Pad Thai was weird. It was very dark and kind of clumpy. It wasn't horrible, but not the best I've ever had. My friend had Thai food from Weera Thai, and their Pad Thai was a lot lighter. I normally don't order Pad Thai, but I was starving and for some strange reason I wanted Pad Thai. The fried rice was pretty good. It just wasn't the same as I was looking for. I ordered a spice level of 7/10, and none of the dishes were spicy at all. I was worried that 7 would be too spicy, but it wasn't spicy at all! It was kind of disappointing, actually.",3

It's inexpensive, open late, less than a 5 minute drive away from my house, and they've got some key menu items that keep me coming back.
Like several other Asian joints, the service is probably not what you'd expect. Once in a while, they'll forget to give you a napkin or have to go back to grab your utensils and there might even be some miscommunication, but the food is well worth it.
Not a huge fan of their pad thai, but I love their duck fried rice and pretty much any of the curries. The portions are generous and the food doesn't take very long either.

Orange chicken was perfectly crisp. Kids ate it up and no complaints. Not that Panda is worth comparing to but it is the kids choice and they usually complain when other Orange chicken doesn't taste right. We had a combo appetizer plate which was a great assortment. Thai chicken skewers were fantastic. Edamame was lightly salted and wonderful

Me had chicken curry and chicken pad Thai. Loved them both. We could have shared either dish because the portion size was nice. Not crazy large but a healthy portion. 

Although we didn't partake in desert they had a nice menu. Price was perfect. They don't serve fountain drinks. This usually annoys me but at 1.25 per can I spent less on drinks than any chain restaurant. I even had TWO cans!!!  

I think you should try this place.",5

So many food choices and big portions for the price. 

Gosh, what haven't I had the one time we had 'brunch' here.  We tried the beef noodle soup with beef and tendon.  The flavor is great, a little saltier than I'd like my beef noodle soup....  the noodles seems like home made but a little over cooked but overall it's delicious and reminds me of home.  We got the rice ball with Chinese fried dough and this is a lot bigger than the ones you get in Taiwan.  It's definitely American sized. 

We had the salty soy milk, one of my favorite things.  Just like home.  We got the sesame pocket with beef w pickled vegetable or I think they called it the beef roll.... amazing.  Spicy marinated meat with tendon is delicious and just enough spicy.  We also had some milk tea...  

Everything is delicious even though the lady might be slightly sassy and snappy....  she also reminds me of home...  :)  I was able to chat up with the owner grandpa, he was super sweet and when he found out I'm also Taiwanese with ancestors from Shandong he was super friendly and the conversation just flowed.

I finished the entire plate, was stuffed and was still gnawing on the bone like a caveman afterwards. The minced pork and egg over the rice was fantastic. One thing that was lacking entirely however  is the pickled veggies. My wife ordered the spicy beef noodle soup. Also tasty and tender. Her only complaint was that they cut all the noodles so they're pretty short. The steamed dumplings were good however I wished there was more hot broth inside of it. Overall we were very impressed.

Ambiance: Mom and Pop. Friendly owner and chef! Good for groups/family. 

Food: 
1. Spicy beef noodle soup -- 5 stars 
They make their own noodles and the consistency is chewy and soft. These noodles soak up the soup without losing their texture.

But this place is a small, family owned place, that only makes up for the shabby appearance by the quality food. I will say that it gave it an authentic feel - grandpa was sitting at the table next to us packaging freshly roasted peanuts and I'm pretty sure I saw grandma back in the kitchen. Definitely coming back here, I only hope I can replicate the amazing meal I had here without help ordering. But then again, even  the dishes that I'd normally avoid (because I don't know much about authentic Taiwanese cuisine) like the oyster pancake/omelette, were so surprisingly good!

My first experience here was great, I came with a fellow yelper, Mike C. and had him order everything. My order came out and everything fine.

My second visit was a desperate one. I originally stopped by Asian BBQ and noodles but they're closed on Fridays :( So...I decided to drive across the street. 

I ordered the beef noodle soup and asked if they could add wontons in it...weird I know but I was craving both. First they brought out a bowl of wontons in beef broth which is understandable and forgivable because of the language barrier. They took it back...added the beef and the noodles...everything looked great until I started eating. The wontons were falling apart as soon as I tried picking them up with my chopsticks. I was starving so I ignored this and continued eating until I bit into one of the wontons and realized that it was still pink...undercooked. Gross...-_-

The service here is non existent...
They have a water cooler and Styrofoam cups if you need water... Feel free to walk up and get it yourself. Same goes for napkins.

However, this time when I went there was HORRIBLE! The first second I walked into the restaurant, there was another Taiwanese elderly lady standing behind the cashier. She was staring at me without any welcoming smile when I was walking to her. When I was standing right in front of her, she didn't greet with me and kinda waiting for me to greet with her. And she gave me a really irritating face! Then she lift up her chin a little bit and blinked in the most annoying way I've ever seen. Ok, I ignored that. Then I told her what I wanted to order for to-go. Then, there's another young male customer came to the cashier and asked for a check. She gave him a very bright smile and called him ""handsome boy"" in Chinese and finished his transaction before me. Really! The guy came after me!!!!! 
Ok, I ignored that too. When she handled me my food, she said ""shiiiit!"" In English. She said it really loud. I didn't really know if she was saying that to me or for something else, but it's still rude to curse in front of a customer.
She is definitely the rudest and the most miserable person I've ever met in my entire life. I didn't do anything or showed any disrespect to her from the very beginning to the end. I even said ""thank you"" after all of this.
Btw, last time me and my bf were there for breakfast, they undercooked the wonton. And it smelled wired.

On the other hand, I just went to Taiwan for a while and I understand so much more now. I understand they are not concerned about customer service, comfort, or cleanliness. People eat street-side and get on their way. It's a lifestyle that is brought here and the bar by which they judge themselves.

So, American-ly speaking: there is no service. Even if you're Taiwanese, nobody is ""American"" nice. If you're Chinese, definitely don't expect them to be nice (but you already knew that, didn't you?). If you're not Asian, expect stares. I was stared at here in one hour more than I was stared at in Taiwan for over a week. On the upside, the menu has some fun typos sure to amuse you while you wait for someone to actually take your order.

I can't remember everything I've had here, but I've had enough to say ""it'll do."" Everything is generally acceptable because there isn't really room to move up or down. For example, soy milk, onion pancakes and Chinese doughnuts will pretty much be the same most places you go. Yes, there will be a rare exception for better or worse but let's be realistic. My favorites are the dan ping (Taiwanese ""pancake"" with egg) and turnip cake (the English spelling I could not tell you). Yes, there are better out there but Taiwanese options are limited in these parts.

What was worse than the rest? The oyster omelette. Terrible oysters. Terrible sauce. Much better can be had. The xiao long bao was also much too thick and light in flavor for my tastes. The fan tuan, a sticky rice roll with greens and pork sung, is also a bit underwhelming but then again, I didn't grow up with it.",3

soymilk  - nice and piping hot. 
beef pancake wraps - skip. the wrap wasn't crispy at all and the beef was bland and forgettable. comes with a side of that delicious pickled cabbage and the pickled cucumbers. Not enough oil on the pickled cucumbers though, so thankfully we ordered it on the side.
salted rice roll - GET THIS. It's a Chinese donut and shredded pork wrapped with sticky rice. Damn good. I haven't had one of these in ages. My pescetarian friend was able to order a vegetarian version. 
pickled cucumbers - spicy and garlicky. worthy of having dragon breath all morning. 
STINKY TOFU! nowhere nearly stinky enough, but it will do if you live somewhere where stinky tofu has been basically banned.

I'm tossed between the Noodle Pot restaurant & this place for the spicy beef stew.  The flavorings are really different.  One feels like its has more flavor (Noodle pot) but I get so thirsty afterwards.  This Yi Mei feels like it can add a little bit more seasoning but the portion size & noodles are more than the Noodle pot.  Btw, Noodle Pot only takes CASH but Yi Mei accepts credit cards.

Michelin has never reviewed Yi Mei Champion --. Two of us had oysters which they both pronounced the best oysters they have ever had anywhere-tender, extremely fresh with no chewiness. One of us has eaten several times in a Paris restaurant the features oysters from all over the world, and these were the best he has ever had. The beet salad was wonderful, the best we have ever had, the duck was cooked perfectly, as was the quail. The chocolate soufflé was delicious as was the apple tart.

The duck's seasoning was unique - I had never had any duck as peppery as that, but it was a nice change of flavor.

They have other noodle dishes and their wonton soups are pretty good, but I would definitely recommend their BBQ. It does seem to be high in demand, and they ran out of roast pork when were were leaving, around 7 PM, so go early!

1131094,En1cwTY0xlOA1l-p8N1_dg,P8DQlNd4ZVCtxFsH_QARFQ,"This is the real deal. Genuine Chinese food with quick prep. However, this place is a ZOO and really popular with the locals. If you want to be waited on hand and foot, go somewhere else. If you are ok being more 'proactive' in grabbing the attention of your overworked (but competent) waitress, then come here, you will not be disappointed.",5

It's been at least three years since we had last visited this Hong Kong style deli noodle house. As the Las Vegas Asian community has grown exponentially during the past two decades, this sort of restaurant fulfills a most important culinary appetite for rice plates and noodles with barbeque deli meats. In Chinese communities throughout the world it is an essential food business on every block. Breakfast is the rice porridge or congee while afternoon and evenings are rice plates and bowls of noodles of all  varieties. Here at Asian BBQ & Noodles it's no different.

It's the Asian version of McDonalds...with one exception, it's better and never boring.",4
1131096,lC40uEUq2nRXIBobzvxedw,P8DQlNd4ZVCtxFsH_QARFQ,"The bbq here is good. Duck is super crispy and pork skin is crunchy without being too dry. Their egg noodles are also delicious. The broth is perfect, noodles still have a slight crisp and they always give a generous portion of meat with the noodles. I usually get wonton egg noodle soup but the duck noodle soup is good too. Another one of my favorites is the salty fish fried rice. We always order a side of this and take most of it to go. I actually prefer it as left overs. For some reason, I think it tastes better cold? Weird, but I like it. I had the seafood porridge the other night.. Just wanted something different and that was definitely a mistake. They forgot my order so I just sat around waiting while everyone finished their meals. It also had absolutely no flavor! I had to add a lot of pepper so it wouldn't taste so bland. Good thing there was plenty of seafood to make up for the lack of flavor. 

I would have given this place 5 stars BUT! They only take cash.... -___-",4
1131097,0QBSuLimUd0H7GbfVBrcoA,P8DQlNd4ZVCtxFsH_QARFQ,"Amazing! Authentic, healthy and super tasty.

I had the Singapore Vermicelli and pork belly and duck was shared at our table too. Incredible flavor and they make their own sauces!

Highly recommend this place but time your visits because its popular and busy around traditional lunch time so go early or later.",5
1131098,AMr0C-M2K_jH9qI33_XVuA,P8DQlNd4ZVCtxFsH_QARFQ,"Roast duck, roast pork, and char siu!!  It doesn't get any better than Asian BBQ & Noodles.  I'm not just talking about Las Vegas, it beats places in Hawaii, LA, and SF!!  I know this is a bold statement, but this place is the best I have been to.  The roast duck is succulent, juicy, and done to perfection.  Even the Jus that comes with the duck tastes awesome.  I don't know what blend of spices they use, but it is mouthwateringly delicious.  The best part is, its not overly greasy and oily like duck from other places.  I don't feel as if my arteries are clogging as I'm eating.  The roast pork is divine.  The skin is perfectly crunch, but not so thick that you chip a tooth (my dad did that once, not cool).  The pork is also seasoned with the same or similar spices as the duck.  First time I've had it done this way.  Adds an added flavor profile not found anywhere else!!  The char siu is very flavorful.  Sweet without being too sweet.  Some of the best char siu I've ever had.  Writing this review is making my mouth water.  There are many other dishes to try, but I have yet to sit down and try one of their noodle bowls.  One of these days, but for now I'm good with taking a duck to go.",5
1131099,d_LSb6gYehJgIOhjZdLAiQ,P8DQlNd4ZVCtxFsH_QARFQ,"This just isn't my type of place. you know your in trouble when there are no appetizers. I also felt that our waiter didn't speak english very well. the choice I made was ok but I wouldn't order it again and with someone who could clearly explain what things were and what I might like Im sure I would have had a better meal. They have whole ducks and pigs hanging in the BBQ warmer,which again isn't my style.I prefer to see my pork cut up on my plate.Im not to keen on seeing dead animals hanging by their snouts while im eating.Looked more like a shop of horrors then a restaurant. Again just not my cup of tea.which by the way we weren't even offered,I guess our eyes were too round to warrant that delicacy. basically my impression was that it was a fast food version of mcdonalds,chinese style.there was also an unpleasant smell in the air. I wont be returning.",2
1131100,nW8t3uaj4saXd5wAmwNwBQ,P8DQlNd4ZVCtxFsH_QARFQ,"One of the very few good chinese BBQ places left in vegas. If anything, in my opinion, its the best in Vegas. 

First of all..... CASH ONLY ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Make sure you have cash, otherwise no yummy food for you ! Applies for entire restaurant, not only the BBQ. Wells Fargo, Chase, and Bank of America are down the street, less than 1/4 mi away.

Ok now that's over. This is a nice little place, in the opposite corner (NE) of the same center as Q Karaoke, HK Star, Cue D's, and China Mama. Quite busy during lunch and dinner hours and they close early. 

They have a variety of foods, that you would normally find in a traditional chinese BBQ place. Noodles, rice plates, fried rice, veggies, etc. Some of their popular dishes would be the ""Noodle Soups"" with a variety of noodles and toppings or the traditional wonton (餛飩) or shui jiao (水餃) dumpling. 

One different thing about this place, that sets it apart from the rest, is their ""Cart Noodle"" (車仔麵). Originated in Hong Kong, it was originally sold on carts. Noodles were freshly cooked to order, with your pick of toppings ranging from pig feet, pig skin, pig stomach, pig intestines, pig blood, etc (continuing on to beef and chicken parts as well). 

This place, gives you a choice of a variety of noodles, and your pick of either 1, 2 or 3 toppings. My favorite combination is Thin Egg Noodles with Pig Intestine, Mix Beef, and Pig Feet. 

The noodles will be cooked to a chinese style of al dente (when its done right...) It should NOT be too soft, but not undercooked hard. It should give a nice bite. 

Another popular item would be their ""BBQ on Rice"" ranging from Roasted Pork on Rice, BBQ Pork on Rice, Roast Duck on Rice, Combination of Two on Rice. As you can see, they have fresh roasted items avail, hanging and cut to order. 

Their Roast Pork is one of my favorites. Priced at a little less than $11/lb for a to-go order (price is different if eaten there), but its a good deal. This is one of the few places in town, that prepare only the belly, vs the entire pig. No bones. All same sizes. Better bang for the buck, right? Crispy bubbled pig skin, wonderfully seasoned, nice proportioned meat to fat ratio, cut to bite sized pieces. Good to snack on (yes ive bought this as a snack) or eaten with your meal ! 

The guys who cut the items are actually fairly accurate. If you want 1 lb, they will be fairly close on it. 

Their roast duck is also a good item to order. Crispy skin, meaty and flavored nicely. Good combination to be eaten with rice or noodles. Can be ordered to-go in half or whole duck. 

If none of the above appeals to you, their fried rice and noodles are nicely done as well ! Good ""wok hei"" as what chinese would call it. Its like an extra flavor that appears when you use a high flame and a wok to cook things. Almost imagine it as, maybe a smokey flavor? 

Great place for a quick bite to eat or with a few people, or even to go and bring home for dinner",4
1131101,Vf1sIte8tTu02XuYdtlqxQ,P8DQlNd4ZVCtxFsH_QARFQ,"Vegan as I am, I declined the BBQ- which looked delicious. A full house can attest to that. My bud had roast pork and duck- and he knows meat. Says it's delicious. Considering how busy this place is, the staff is courteous and friendly. Really tasty stuff here.",5
1131102,XXHWmUPFGwSG_Psdwgz4GA,P8DQlNd4ZVCtxFsH_QARFQ,"You know it's the real deal when the duck is hanging by it's neck in the display case when walk into the restaurant. Sort if a whole in the wall in china town. I thought the restaurant was efficient and fast. 

1. Chinese sausage fried rice very good ( on the menu it says salted fish and sausage, just get sausage)

2. Seafood dry chow fun ( okay but not that good) maybe the gravy ones better

3. The BBQ pork and roast pork belly was the best. The roast duck was okay kind of chewy want the skin more crisp

Overall food was very good for the price $38 
For all the food I just mentioned",4
1131103,Brf8Y7w1lSJTDluooiyXdw,P8DQlNd4ZVCtxFsH_QARFQ,"Wow.   What a dive.   Ordered half a duck,  got all bones.   I almost sent it back asking for the meat half.   Would never recommend to anyone.   Too bad,  I had such high hopes. .  Flavorless water disguised as soup. ..

Cash only. ..

Now I need to get some REAL food.",1
1131104,X70UEY3Q-yPcQ1yGcwNA0g,P8DQlNd4ZVCtxFsH_QARFQ,"Everyone is raving about the pork, but I actually preferred the duck. I ordered the combination and I'm sure glad I did because all I read on here is the pork. I thought the pork was okay and the duck was actually tastier. I came on a Saturday night and it was pretty busy, but we were seated immediately when we came in. Most of the items are under $10, which is a deal in my book. Maybe this place was a little too authentic for me because most of the dishes had a home-made flare rather than the typical Chinese restaurant. One thing I do applaud them for is the service, the service was greeat! We were treated like human beings, which not very common at Chinese restaurants. Most of the time as a customer you feel like the server/owner is doing you a favor by serving you, but totally not the case here. If you're a big duck fan definitely come here. I'll probably swing by again just to try the soup because it looks pretty tasty on the Yelp pictures.",4

You can build your own bowl of noodles (choose the type of noodle you want, the broth, and the toppings) or you can order a pre-set combination of noodle, broth, and toppings. 

Also, get the duck or any of the BBQ meats in addition to the noodles.

For two people again so much food and plenty take home to the posse aka kids. Bonus, the bill was only 40 bucks.

I've been here a few times now and have compared the wonton noodle soup (my comfort food) to other's I've had in Vegas and they are hands down the best in the city.   Even their roast duck and roast pork is awesome.  It is always packed and is a cash only establishment but well worth the wait.",5

This is not the nicest chinese restaurant that you'll find in Las Vegas but the food is great! They serve the usual entrees that you would find in most Chinese restaurants but their specialty is their delicious noodle soups and BBQ entrees. 

My go-to order here is a bowl of wonton egg noodle soup with the thin noodles with a side of chinese brocolli that is served with oyster sauce. These items sound simple but always leaves me satisfied and happy as can be. Their roast pork is delicious as well. I usually would avoid eating the skin of pork but that would be a sin here.

Most of the employees speak both Chinese and Vietnamese which I found pretty impressive. Their English is for the most part...broken..so be patient...you won't regret it. The food and affordable prices will have you coming back time and time again.",5

Fact:
1. They are cash only business.
2. If u are looking for a place to eat. Where u can contemplate and consider the merits of each mouth watering dish in a calm and zen like environment. ""This is not the place"" 
It is pure chaos, noise (chatter) and movement all the time.  ""I Love it"". Chinese food with a show! 
3. Expect to be greeted and seated with a menu when they can get to you! 
4. Expect to be asked for your order 20sec after u have been seated. You have 10sec to respond with ur full order, or they will move on to the next customer. (Saw 2 different hostess do this)
5. Some of the best prices and menu options.
6. A non complex menu. It is what it is! With gravy or dry is all u need to know for your noodle dishes.
7. 5 star:  must tries
     The duck, so good.
     The soup, seafood dumpling with noodles. The broth was rich, salty. 
     4 Star:  delicious
     The crispy pork belly and BBQ pork rib combo. I personally did not try this (gave up pork products for lent) but trust the people I was having lunch with. That it was good.
      Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce. I know not original. But this is always a must order dish for me .
     3 Star: good but not great .
      Combination crispy noodle. The noodles were off the hook. The gravy was good, that's it just good .

1. The best service you will ever have.

The broth is clear, flavorful, not too salty, and hot (in temperature). It cooks the noodles, so you have to wait about 2-3 mins. to dig into those. In the mean time you can sip broth and eat the delicious wonton (pork) wontons. It's the bomb if you know/like Chinese soup. They also add scallions and a few chinese greens.

I've tried their roasted pork. I did not think it was the bomb like other reviewers. It's ok. I think I just have spent my childhood eating roasted pork (lechon). So, if eating pork , I guess I prefer that (and wontons, and bacon of course).",4

Right when I walked in, the ladies working the front eagerly waved me down and started convincing me that I wanted a lb of everything. It reminded me of walking into a car dealership and approaching the wave of commission based salesmen. Be sure to stay strong or you will succumb to the glorious pork that's glistening right in front of you and end up buying more than you intended. 

Initially I was planning on purchasing a half lb of each, but I easily couldn't resist and ended up buying 1 lb of each - roast pork belly and BBQ pork, all for $27.20. They weigh each kind of meat (majority of the time it's a little over what you intended to buy) But, I honesty don't regret buying a little over (unless I was on a strict budget). Make sure to request a copy of your receipt if you need one, they don't give one typically for BBQ take-out orders. 

I took one bite and was astonished on how crispy, juicy, and flavorful the roast pork belly was. Wow, can I just say mouthgasm? Nothing in this world can beat an expertly roasted crispy pork belly skin. They make a wining one here with an indescribable magical crunch. They also provide a small container of plum hoisen sauce to dip your pork belly in. They pair perfectly together - perfect harmony of salty and sweet.  

As I expected, The BBQ pork was expertly prepared as well. Tender, moist, seasoned well and not over salted. It would be amazing in sandwiches (banh mi), with rice, in egg noodle soup...or hell, served in a boot!

We started off with a won ton soup noodles to share and followed with a entrée of double meat delicacy - pork belly roast pork and soy sauce chicken. Both meats were cooked perfectly - pork belly crispy on the exterior with just the right amount of fat for flavor and the chicken was fresh and you could taste the freshness. Chow fun was just as solid as the other entrees and was a generous serving.

First thing you'll notice when you walk in are the BBQ meats hanging from the window by the back counter. Their roast pork belly with the crispy skin is to die for and their BBQ pork is really good as well. I haven't tried the chicken or duck so can't comment on it but from the looks of everything hanging in the window, it looks pretty damn delicious. You can order meats as an order or rice plate combo. If ordering to go, everything is by weight.

The other items are another story. I've tried the congee, BBQ pork chow fun, Chinese broccoli and a combo soup noodle w/ pig feet and curry beef tendon. The congee was meh, so-so; I've definitely had better at dim sum places. The BBQ pork chow fun was the only thing good out of this group and probably only because it had BBQ pork. The Chinese broccoli was all stems and very little leafy parts which was disappointing and the soup noodle was terrible because the noodles were clumped together which made it difficult to eat.

Because this is a traditional Chinese style restaurant, service is not very good and it'll take a while to get someone's attention even though they have many employees roaming the restaurant at any given time. Also, don't bother speaking to them in Mandarin because their English is definitely a lot better than their Mandarin...they'll just look at you like they understand and then they'll disappear and you'll never get what you asked for. We spoke to 3 different waiters in Mandarin trying to get our check and to go boxes and 1 by 1 they disappeared and were never seen again. After waiting 10 min and speaking with 3 waiters, we ended up going up to one of the ladies and speaking to her in English and magically we got what we wanted. If they didn't understand us then why wouldn't they just say so? How rude! Definitely 1 star for service based on my most recent visit! But their BBQ is good and I'll continue coming back just for that, but not anything else though",3

Same goes for the roast pork too. The crunch of the skin on the pork is just perfection.

But we could order 3 side dishes at $3 and that would equal a pound.  We'll take 2.  The owner stood and watch the server scoop to make sure she wasn't going to give us extra.  Awkward!! 

We ordered the roast pork appetizer only to be told they just sold out of it.  Ok, give us one of the 3 ducks hanging in the window.  Sorry someone came in right now and bought the last three.  Well, let's go won ton noodle soup.  The broth was super salty but flavorful and the won tons were tasty.  30 minutes later they told us they had more duck and roast pork.  Great we'll take a side dish of both.  Sorry you can only buy in lbs.  Ok we will take a pound.  Duck was super fatty and the skin was not crispy at all, yuck.  I must admit the pork was good.

I ordered the duck wonton soup to ease the fever I was hosting that day. And the BBQ pork and duck plate was for my boyfriend. 

The soup was fairly salty, as all duck soups tend to be. Won ton was average. But, that crispy fatty duck was soooooooooooooo worth every every single non customer service stares I got that day. 

I absolutely loved it. 

The BBQ pork was off the hook, too. 

Maybe it was the fact that I haven't had either dish since moving out of Hawaii but, boy oh boy...I'm glad I was sick and saw that on someone's IG feed.

Great neighborhood place when you don't feel like driving too far, DEFINITELY.

I live just around the corner from Golden China.  (Which yes, means I live just around the corner from Beijing Noodle which I don't like as much)  This is my go to Chinese place.  

Pros:  Portions are good, always have leftovers.  Prices are very reasonable.  Service is fast.  Their dishes actually have meat in them, not just filler.  They have some menu items that aren't found everywhere else.  

Cons:  They do sometimes get the orders wrong, so I always check before I leave the restaurant.  Delivery takes a LONG time, even though I live less than a mile away.  Absolutely no ambiance, so don't plan to eat here...

Definitely order:
NY Style Egg Rolls
Corn Egg Flower Soup
Wor Wonton Soup (packed with veggies, meat and wontons)
Chinese Eggplant with Tofu
Sesame Beef
HK Style Crispy Noodle 
Taiwanese Mei Fun

I am being quite honest when I say that I am not a huge fan of Chinese food, due to the fact I have a shell fish allergy, and I've had a few reactions to food being mixed. That's beside the point! Anyways, when we do get Chinese food I usually just order pork fried rice, adventurous I know, but anyways I will say that it was not the most flavorful or tasty rice I've ever had and the pork was quite slimy. My fiancée ordered the house special and chow mein with rangoons. He loved the rangoons and said the house special was alright. But the chow mein nearly made him vomit, the noodles slimed out of the box in one clump. According to him (it had shrimp) the chow mein was the plainest he ever had. The only thing he salvaged from it was the shrimp. I give 3 stars because the delivery time was not long at all.

My friend got their Shrimp Pad Thai. We got it to go. While we were waiting for the food, we found out they delivered and we live close. So that was a plus.

My tip for the owner of the restaurant:
Train your employee (waiter) to never say anything BAD in the menu. That time we tried to order something, the waiter just snaped off and said: ""No, don't, its BAD"".
 
I may understand the waiter/manager just tried to suggest something better for us and I appreciated it. However it could be a turn off for the customer, esp the customers who are new in town and unfamiliar with your restaurant. 

The waiter could use a lil' bit more formality when taking orders and serving the food.

If one guest on a full table were aksing for a water, that could be a clue for you to offer some drinks to other guests on the same table as well.

I'll give it that the combo fried rice was okay but when we got our half roasted duck and it was incredibly over cooked. IT WAS BLACK. I am not joking as I state that. I have never had badly cooked duck before.
The service was definitely negative stars, the waitress paid more attention to the damn television. We also never got our water. We don't even get that?! Really?! Over priced for what they serve. Even if it was half the price I would still never ever try their food again. The table cover was also filthy. They can't even change their table covers? Nothing amazing or good about this place. Everyone else that has reviewed this restaurant to be exceedingly horrible are not exaggerating. IT'S TRUE. You might as well save your money and head to McDonalds or something. Uncaring employees, especially with their food. I can't believe this business is even open.

When the food arrive,  me and my wife were disgusted by the appearance, left over dry beef, old vegetables,  and a broth that taste like MSG with salt. Please see our photos.  We are not picky people But this is beyond edible.  See the photos.  I told my wife not to touch It because we are on vacation,  and I don't want this to ruin our trip.

1163651,2tzEU7malDw2oxabiQ4qmQ,onItgedmKDLbI3JHOE5XTA,"Many Las Vegans have declared that pursuing authentic Taiwanese food in this town is like finding a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow. My ever-growing curiosity in this uniquely ethnic cuisine, as well as guidance from people who are knowledgeable about this food has led me to Noodle Pot. I can say, without a shadow of doubt, that this establishment has superseded  my expectations!

Following a brief stop at the Shavery, I ran into Will (a.k.a. the artist formerly known as SnowFlake), along with a couple of Yelper's, and we decided to go to Noodle Pot. I have driven past this joint many times without thinking twice to stop in. It was a startling revelation to learn that, according to Will, Noodle Pot has some truly legitimate  Taiwanese grub in Vegas. Most notably, I wanted to try the national dish of Taiwan, spicy beef noodle soup.

I admire extraordinary mom-and-pop, hole-in-the-wall resto's, and Noodle Pot fits the bill to a tee. The comfortable yet lively vibe keeps the interaction going. After the server sat us down, we ordered some appetizers along with the spicy beef noodle soup.

Cold Vegetable Appetizer Plate - The first time I ordered this it came with pickled cucumbers and other vegetables, and wheat gluten. The cucumbers were marvelous, with the correct amount of saltiness to harmonize with the sweetness used in the sauce. The wheat gluten was another smash hit. It tasted incredibly akin to a concoction of beef and chicken. 

(Note: Coming here on a separate visit, and ordering this dish again, they had replaced the wheat gluten with soy sauce hard-boiled eggs. I notably did not enjoy them, and I was not too confident to which tree the egg grows on, but that's just me ((hehe)).

Pork and Chive Dumplings - Another sublime feature! The dumpling wrappers tasted hand made, and the filling inside was outstanding with perfectly tender pork matching the bright flavor of the chives. The vinegary soy sauce dip was the icing on the cake.

Beef Roll - My least favorite item, but pretty splendid nonetheless. Slices of beef and cilantro wrapped around a thin crepe. I actually prefer other Chinese versions that use a thicker, flakier scallion pancake in which the inside is coated with hoisin sauce. But, it was delish.

Spicy Beef Noodle Soup - the ""Pièce de résistance"" to our meal. We opted for the wide noodles instead of the regular noodles (think of it as thicker version of pappardelle). The noodles were perceived as if they were hand made and hand pulled, even though they probably came from a special noodle factory. The broth was nuts! It was packed with beef flavor, but exceptionally delicate. Hints of tomato added depth. Large portions of tender beef dotted the soup. Also, if the server has not brought out the chopped pickled cilantro, ask for it. That combined with the baby bok choy in the soup will give the dish a marvelous variation!

Many have mentioned this before, but I will proclaim it again. CASH ONLY!!! Save the plastic for the surgeon's table! :D

(Another side note: I took my brother here when he visited and at the time they had run out of beef so we opted for the Spicy Beef Tendon Soup. Even though I was fine, my brother returned home and had the hershey squirts for the next few days. The soup comes with a tremendous amount of tendons, so if you are not used to eating lots of offal or weird animal bits, I would be cautious when ordering this version).",5
1163652,0OebCi0FxkaJF5fq1_hlqg,onItgedmKDLbI3JHOE5XTA,What a great place! We came here with 10 people and every dish was spot-on!,5
1163653,vdM2NLKo0d6klaWxiRkbOg,onItgedmKDLbI3JHOE5XTA,worst place I ever been... should have Mc Donalds instead. don't bring your american friends.,1
1163654,w-GBmtEtJ85CZCVOzVmM_g,onItgedmKDLbI3JHOE5XTA,"If I was only rating based on the  beef noodle stew (which comes in both normal and spicy variety), I would have definitely given this place 5 stars. Only reason I brought it down to four was because the cold dishes we ordered on the side were atrocious. It was so evidently clear that they sat in the fridge for ages that I preferred to leave them untouched. 

The cold dishes came out all stuck together and packed together like an ice cube. It actually took the use of a fork to break it apart because chopsticks were too flimsy for the job. Buuuuuut, the beef noodle stew...

Ahhh the beef noodle stew is exquisite. The amount of spices and herbs they use make this extremely tasty. Get the spicy variety as you will not regret it. Huge, bold flavor packed into one bowl, if you are craving beef noodle stew this is the place to go. The store doesn't have a sign outside so look for a place with a Pig as it's mascot (pig from the story Journey to the West).",4
1163655,esIbl61-rY9IlejmJvddJg,onItgedmKDLbI3JHOE5XTA,"My mom was in town so I decided to give this place a try to see how authentic their Taiwanese beef noodle soup is. This place is alright and overpriced for the quality of food and in comparison to other places we've been to. We ordered 4 items to share between the 2 of us since it was our first time here: wonton soup, beef tendon noodle soup, chicken over rice, and a mixed appetizer plate.

Wonton soup: Decent flavor and a good number of wontons were the highlights, but nothing to really rave about. It was tastier than I had expected it to be and for $5.99 I wouldn't mind ordering it again, but again nothing to rave about

Beef tendon noodle soup: Probably the best dish we ordered, although it's a little pricey for 10 bucks IMO. The soup had good flavor, wasn't too spicy and the tendon was chewy and not overcooked. They also gave a pretty generous portion of beef tendon which was surprising

Chicken over rice: This dish was terrible...so dry and overcooked that I barely ate 1 of the 3 pieces of chicken and then boxed the rest up, hoping I would eat it later...we'll see. The chicken is fried and they over over fried this thing...it's so dry, a bag of chips has more moisture than it! Very disappointing to get this dish after dealing with an incident with someone else getting our order (more on that below). $7.99 for this entree is a rip when you compare it to the other ones in our order that were actually edible.

Mixed appetizer plate: Forgot what this dish is actually called but it was a mix of beancurd, beef tripe or tendon (not entirely sure) in some kind of chili oil. It was good but man $6.95 is highway robbery for a dish of this size...but I think it's pretty common pricing in Vegas....miss all the reasonably priced appetizers and entrees in Texas!

Our order all arrived separately throughout our meal and on 4 different occassions. While we were still waiting on the chicken over rice, we heard the table next to us complain about receiving the wrong order. Apparently he had received our chicken dish instead of his pork chop dish since they delivered it to the wrong table...problem is, he had already touched and dug his chopsticks into the food although he hadn't actually eaten it...The waitress looked at us and asked if it was ok to re-serve this plate to us! WTF, ARE YOU SERIOUS?! First of all, I'm sure there some kind of health regulation against this, but if not, it's just downright gross! We told them hell no and that if they did it'd be wrong. So they took the dish back to the kitchen and said they'd bring us a new one. After discussing amongst ourselves we decided to go up and tell them that they could cancel that item off our order because we didn't want it since we were suspicious that they were going to re-serve us the entree. They told us that they would never to such a thing and that they were working on making a new one. Problem is, once they took it to the back we couldn't see what happened to it and for all we know they just re-served it to us. It was a terrible dish anyways in the end which made it even more disappointing.

Not sure if I'll come back in the future, but the only thing really worth getting here is their beef noodle soup. As you can tell, service is terrible here but it's a traditional Asian owned restaurant so what can you expect? They're CASH ONLY as well so be sure to have some paper on you to cover the tab at the end.",1

They're beef noodle soup is one of the best things on menu. Also they're portions are very generous and they really work to become an aspiring business. Even though they get busy, they serve you and get you so they can keep running. They don't wanna keep people waiting for their food. Sometimes when they aren't busy, you may see the owner just sitting there reading. As a boss he still helps and is really social. I love this place.",5
1163659,LS9pNhsh1f9RttoD-m9-bA,onItgedmKDLbI3JHOE5XTA,"I've lived in and traveled around China long enough to have developed a deep craving for beef noodle soup, and this place hits the spot. Amazingly delicious food can be found in the skeeziest looking shops over there. Most places, families live in the same run down shack as their ""restaurant""; so you'll often find the owners' socks and undies drying in the bathroom. You'll be faced with a few basic tables with creaky little stools, a menu board on the wall, and not much else. It takes some getting used to, but I've now come to associate the dumpiest looking shacks with the promise of the most soulfoul food. Noodle Pot is not terribly dumpy, but it does have that basic noodle hut vibe. It's tiny and simple. The menu offerings are narrow. And the soup is hearty and plentiful. Eight bucks will get you a very substantial bowl of tender beef and noodles with the ubiquitous bok choy. Make sure to doctor it up with plenty of whatever is in the jars and bottles on the table (most likely dark vinegar, soy sauce, and chili paste). Then say so long, tuck in and disappear. The flavors are deep and satisfying, right on the money. One senses that many hours have gone into the rich broth and meltingly tender beef. The noodles don't appear to be hand made, as they lack the characteristic tenderness and touthsomeness. These are fine, but they don't make the dish which is all about the beef and the broth. Rather disappointing was the cold cucumber dish I ordered. In China the crushed cucumber dish is about as standard a way to begin a meal as the bread basket is in the west. Over there you will get fresh chunks of crunchy cukes dressed lightly with rice vinegar, and often accompanied by peanuts. Cold, crunchy, salty, a bit of sour--it's a freakishly addictive way to begin a meal. The one I received at Noodle Pot was a sad, pale version of the standard. The cucumbers were soft and wilted, with almost no crunch or flavor. They had clearly sat too long and should not have been served. 

Service is a non-issue in a joint like this. The gals take your order, bring your food and largely ignore you unless you flag them down. This is the norm in China, where you have to shout at the servers to get their attention. It isn't considered rude for them to ignore you, or for you to holler across the room at them. It's all business here; you come in, sit down, order your dishes, and start slurping. The evening I came in plenty of folks were crowded around the tables, hunched over, slurping away. It's exactly how it should be in place like this, and its why I'll be back.",3

Please look around where your going to sit. I did NOT pay attention where the FUCK i was going to sit and just sat down... I sat down next to this most ANNOYING, ANNOYING customers that did not Shut the F!!! up during the whole time I was eating. Omg!!!!!!!!!!! It was this blasted God knows what side of America they came out of and how the hell they ended up at the same place at the same time I was there eating... but they were absolutly annoying!

  I have no clue how many times they said, ""OH this is so good, this is so yummy, this is soo gooey"" and when they would slurp there noodles, they would make that sound that fat people would make. You know that sound that sounds like they are having sex with the food? So disgusting. It's like this, ""Ohhh...!!! Ummmohhhh! Auhmmm!!! Yes....! So good!!! OHHH!!!"" (I was pissed writing the first part but now I am busting out laughing when I wrote those sounds hahahahaha)

  Yeah and to make things a little bad I was sitting next to another pair, which came later after me so not my fault. Who did not stop making those nasty snorkling noises like they had mucus stuck in their throat.

  Okay back to the topic at hand. It does give you an atmosphere like they just want your money. I feel as if they only want the big crowd of people eating there. But if you want to eat here, come when its dead and you won't feel that your being rushed. No weekend is what I mean. Like a Tuesday, or Wednesday. Cause if you go like me on a Sunday you will get these two groups like I did. You don't want that! BELIEVE ME!
  aHH Yeah the soup. Its good kinda typical, just a nice pit stop so dont expect anything amazing. Thats unless you've never tried noodles then you will be tricked to believe you are eating something spectacular. It's a small place.",3
1163662,UEddaiCt8Z3TN8FgTBf0ow,onItgedmKDLbI3JHOE5XTA,"I'll just say this right off the bat - I can't eat the famous beef noodle soup because I can't chew fat and cartilage without being grossed out. The beef itself aside - I actually like the broth and the noodles. Apparently, so do a lot of other more qualified people to get an opinion from. Just scroll around!

I'm told they make their own noodles here. They make their own wrappers as well for things like wontons. I can safely say, having had their noodles many times now - they are done right. But my favorite has to be their wontons in chili oil. I can eat these forever. They are the perfect thickness in wrapper, perfect flavor in the meat, and the right amount of broth and juice left over from the cooking process. The chili oil is the icing on this savory cake. Ok ok, wontons aside...

- Their small appetizer dish of porous tofu in sesame oil is always a favorite of mine.
- Their dan dan noodles are extremely light in taste, swimming in a watery peanut sort of sauce. I prefer this to be thicker and more flavorful but I know Taiwanese food tends to be on the blander/milder side of the flavor spectrum.

Service is about what you can expect from Chinatown. This is yet another hole in the wall. You know how it is if you've been pretty much anywhere else on this block. Lastly, and this is important... cash only!",4
1163663,mFvtg_LuLM781a_wmThYCQ,onItgedmKDLbI3JHOE5XTA,"After talking to Michael K about my previous negative and less than impressed experience here, we decided to come back so I could give it another try. Remembering that the chicken rice dishes here are trash I went with a beef tendon noodle soup, Mike went with beef noodle soup, and we shared an order of wontons in chili oil. Judging by the items ordered, I can say that this place is authentic, as their noodle soups are served simiarly to what you would find in Taiwan.

The beef tendon noodle soup ($8.99) was tasty, with a generous amount of tendon which is the best part! The broth itself was flavorful even though I asked them to make it less spicy for me. They have a spicy and non-spicy version of this dish by the way, so you can also get it mild. The noodles and tendon were soft, very tender and perfectly cooked. I would come back just for this soup alone.

The wontons in chili oil ($6.50) was also an impressive dish, and it too was served the traditional way. The chili oil gave the wontons a nice oily flavor but wasn't too overpowering or spicy by any means. The wontons were thin with a decent amount of pork wrapped inside.

The service here was a lot better than the last time around and our order was correct with no issues whatsoever. It was interesting that we were the only ones here at noon and then all of a sudden the place exploded and a huge rush of several different parties came in at the same time. This place is pretty solid for their authentic noodle soups, but that's all I would recommend here as an entree.",4
1163664,D1WOjD9yIfMw8kDN39bqRw,onItgedmKDLbI3JHOE5XTA,"This restaurant is very average compared to what others available in Las Vegas. But before I rate and compare their foods to other similar restaurants, I like to point out one thing that is VERY UNPLEASANT. IF YOU ARE NOT A MANDARIN SPEAKING CHINESE, YOU ARE GOING TO GET SECOND RATE SERVICE. AND, THE SERVICE OVERALL IS BELOW AVERAGE FOR RESTAURANTS LIKE THIS TO START WITH. Sad to see this. We spoke English to the waitress and was seated. At least 4 groups came in after us. They ALL spoke Mandarin and were handed manus and served tea quickly. We waited and waved at the waitress to get attention. She brought us the menu and then the tea. The waitress then proceeded to take orders and served the foods to the 4 groups came in after us. Again, I waved for the waitress and she came and took my orders. CAME IN FIRST AND SERVED 5TH, NOT RIGHT !

The foods are pretty standard Taiwanese food and can be compared to other similar restaurants easily, like China Mama, Taiwan Deli, or the now closed Taiwan Kitchen, just to name a few. The beef roll was greasy, the jar jong mien was tasteless, the spicy beef was tough, and the beef brisket noodle was bland. It only deserve 2 stars and no more. Their location is in the Chinatown Plaza so it is a tourists trap. Locals beware.",2

The noodles were guud, indeed, they were very guud (especially because of the inebriation factor). The soup was flavorful and not very oily. The prices were very fair and the location is open till midnight. Service was very quick and pleasant.

Noodle pot serves up some fairly legit Taiwanese cuisine that definitely rivals that in either LA or the Bay Area. The beef and tendon noodle soup is to die for. Packed with flavor, this soup definitely brings a little heat to the palate too...but all in good form. The beef was fork tender and the tendon was just chewy enough and not a hair bit tough. The noodles were excellent too. Chewy without being too dense. Definitely a winner.

We also tried the pork and chive dumplings. Very standard, but still well done. The skin was not too thick nor floury and dumplings had good filling. The pork chop noodle soup was an excellent non-spicy counterpart to the spicy beef and tendon soup. The pork chop was juicy and charred to perfection.

I venture to the storefront with the pig as its logo at the recommendation of my Tawainese banker.  She should know.  And she scribbled in Chinese letters on a piece of scrap paper at the bank the words for Liver Soup with noodles and I dutifully presented that to the cashier at Noodle Pot.  Ten minutes later I was immersed in a beautiful tasting broth with that wonderful fresh liver taste. Yum. Four stars for me. In coming back to try more.,4

Pork cabbage, shrimp chives dumpling: not bad just very small and small portioned
Pork rice plate: a few pieces of extremely fatty pork with lots and lots of rice
Wonton soup: the pork stinks

They gave it to us, with it leaking all over the bag, and when we asked for an extra bag, she smacked her lips and gave us a dirty look. 
I'm like what?? On top of that, they gave us 2 dipping sauce for ""SEVENTY"" dumplings when normally you'd get one for every 10. 
I'm just really disappointed at the service. 
Besides their horrible service, the food is really good.

We had the spicy beef noodle soup and the wonton noodle soup. The broth for both weren't too salty and had a good bit of flavor to them. The wontons were smaller than what I'm used to, but everything in LA comes supersized already. The beef rolls were wrapped in some sort of thin flour mixed with egg and was quite delicious. I also enjoyed the pork chop which was charred to perfection and has some good taste to it. 

Overall, the experience was great with their speedy service, polite waitresses, and otherwise brutally long waits in the buffet lines. I'd come here again if I ever encounter long buffet lines!",3

The classic beef noodles costs $9 which is a little expensive but the taste makes up for it. 

Be prepared for a wait to be seated!!! And it got so busy in the store where many people were standing around making the small dining area even smaller and I had conflicts with my neighboring table because of the confined space. Also, there were only two waitresses taking orders, serving food, and working the register... That was clearly not enough. I had to wait 5 minutes for a take out box!

The only place here that we consider a destination is No. 1 Boba Tea.  You cannot spot this place from the outside.  You have to enter the mall, and there you will find it hidden away.

I already had lunch so we just drove around the plaza to see what it had. I just saw restaurants and bakeries and it isnt much of a walking around place to visit. I say you come here for a meal and maybe grab a boba and bounce. You can easily find these restaurants and plaza back in the bay so this is hardly worth a visit. I bet a few restaurants are good but didnt get to try. The only good thing is that there is a Bank of America next to it so you can withdraw cash without being charged at the hotel atm...so you can end up losing it while gambling.",1

Everywhere we travel we always find a Chinese location or a China town to visit. This is a nice spot for visitors. Their variety of shops are cool. I like browsing at all those small shop.

For the most part all the shop owners were very nice and courteous.  There was one who tried to haggle other customers into buying her products, it just ended in the being driven away.

Won ton soup had a ton of meat also, but the won tons were falling apart. Soup was packed with meat, veggies, and soggy won ton wrappers.

The veggies were fresh, shrimp was large and fresh as well! Pot stickers were seemingly homemade - which I enjoyed and for the long wait time, the egg rolls were surprisingly crisp. As for the flavor, the pot stickers and the egg rolls were pretty good, the Kung Pao Shrimp was a little lack luster on depth, a bit greasy, & what I would consider a little too spicy for a diner's ""regular"" palate - I can handle spice though. Added some soy sauce and a bit of salt/MSG to waken up the flavor and it was okay... :/ The sides were tasty, and the visual appeal of the Kung Pao Shrimp was exciting...so I was disappointed by the sauce in this dish.

Watch the spice level!  1-10 is not the same as other places... so when they warn you, please take heed.  

I really like Pan Asian.  When we went on Saturday- we were the first customers in the joint.  They accommodated our party of 9 + a baby.  It's not a very large place.. We literally took up half of the restaurant.

Our waiter was very polite, as was the rest of the staff.  He made a lot of good suggestions, warned us about the heat levels.... and immediately took our order since we had some time to look at the menus .  

I don't even remember what everyone else had.. but i remember what I had. ha! 
I started with the malaysian roti because I love that stuff... and Pan Asian did not disappoint.   The yellow curry was creamy and full of flavor.    My entree: was MORE CURRY! Massaman, and I love it!  

*What I do remember is my daughter ordering the vietnamese shrimp ravioli and marking the heat at 1-- and it was WAAAAAY to hot... even for the spice lovers at the table.  

Next time we are ordering with 0 spice.  hahaha.. seriously.  If this place wasn't so far I'd be visiting as often as we visit our favorite local thai joint in our area.

Picked up asian takeout for three tonight for just under $30- seafood soup, beef pad se ew, and chicken masaman curry, extra side of rice. Portions were okay but were split among three, pricing was fair but seafood soup could have been larger. Good for $7 price, but not a meal on its own. Curry was heavy on the potatoes, so with the rice it was pretty starchy, but that kept it from being too spicy. Pad se ew was among the best BF has had, and it's the main thai dish he gets everywhere we go.
Side note about the soup: pick out the green pepper pieces prior to eating unless you want to spit out your soup in spicy surprise. Otherwise, the mix of crab, mussels, shrimp, and octopus is delightful.

Service was good. Ordered to go, just a few minutes prior to close, and was helped with a smile and the order was out quick. Saw a few pictures of dishes above the counter after we ordered, but did not find them on the menu itself- shrimp and fish ball soup, duck soup, etc., unclear whether they're special features, by request only, or no longer on the menu.

Would come back here, and we'd likely try different dishes- the garlic chicken in particular caught my eye, as did the drunken noodles. Maybe better for lunch specials though, pricing looks a little better at ~$7/dish.",4
1215091,YO_w_nZrVDUF-Tl_BahrWA,8HCC8NuJmdHnEg2XC00NPg,"Yes, I dropped a star. Gasp! Why?!

Well, I've been back here a number of times since I reviewed it. But I'd also been there a few times before the review. Anyway. As life often has it - with more experience comes a shift in POV.

I think Pan Asian is confused.

1. Portions and thought into the food is relative to that of fine dining. Portions are small. It's relatively expensive for this reason. The food definitely has its own personal style and preference. Not a bad thing, but I'm finding being ""Asian"" cuisine means nothing is outstanding and exceptional - but instead good and interesting. The plating of food has taken a recent step up. Presentation has always been good. I did notice prep time dramatically dropped.

2. The inside is sort of hybrid between low budget and nice. If you look at the flooring, it's bricks. The walls are red with nice decoration. There are curtains (which NEED to be closed towards the end of the day before we all die of sunburns). The tables and chairs feel cheap. The menu is MEGA cheap, but appropriate for take-out. 

3. Service has always been generally good, though occasionally forgetful of details.

4. A bit out of place as a point but... the tea got cheaper. It used to be jasmine tea. Now it is something that all THREE of us said tastes like burned cooking oil.

I think it would really help them out to decide what their goal is here. It's a mixed bag. Is it fine dining hiding in an economy sort of shell? Is it a take-out ""Asian"" place that has stepped it up? Knowing a bit about them I know they came from fine dining and it shows, but it just isn't clear what the mission is anymore.",4
1215092,e0GjNLMhaZltmbOcm_2SJw,8HCC8NuJmdHnEg2XC00NPg,"I don't remember being so disappointed in a restaurant.  Not because the food or experience was so bad...but because all the reviews were so positive.  Perhaps my expectations were too high???

Let me start with the positive.  Service was very personal and very attentive.  Prices were very reasonable.  

The food was mediocre at best.  

Chicken Satay was not very flavorful.  The peanut sauce looked like it came from a bottle.

The Ravioli app was okay.  The wrap was good and the presentation was great, but the filling was over-processed and flavorless.

The Duck Curry was good.  The curry was a bit runny.  

The ribs were probably the best thing we ordered.  The XO sauce was really good but I felt that the ribs were overcooked.  

The beef salad was really bad.  Poor slices of beef...some cut with the grain and tough to chew.  The salad looked like the regular spring mix that you pick up at the market.  

The basil fried rice was especially bad.  This is a dish we get at all Thai restaurants and the entree we use to compare restaurants.  Theirs is heavy on the soy sauce and not very deep with flavors.

We might try it for the lunch specials but unlikely that we would return for dinner.",3
1215093,EvYHGyDaSnUcqiP2DF259w,8HCC8NuJmdHnEg2XC00NPg,"This is my second time here and I just love the service.   Other places that shall remain nameless treat you like you are an inconvenience..hard to get refils, dont offer advice, just general lack of personable qualities.  

Now about the food. Had massaman curry and drunken noodles first visit.  Both soild choices and would order again.   This time got the tom kha soup spice level 2 (just a hint of heat for me) on recommendation of another review.  The flavor is very good but I prefer it a bit more creamy like kinnaree or thai noodle house.  Always get roti...its sinfully good here.

The service is fantastic and the owners treat their customers well.,5
1215095,oe8fi3lZkKFADR02_f_Tiw,8HCC8NuJmdHnEg2XC00NPg,"Been here twice so far.

First visit:
Came here for dinner and ordered the duck curry on a yelper's recommendation. Absolutely love the duck curry. To quote another yelper, ""The crispy duck curry is a savory thai curry shimmered with the sweet pineapple and grapes, sometimes with lycee to balance out the spiciness, while the duck are fried super crispy."" This is one dish that I tried on that yelper's recommendation and it was superb. LOVE IT! Just be careful with regards to the spice level. If you can't take spicy, go mild. I think I had mine at level 6 or 7 and it was somewhat burning my mouth. And I generally have my food spicy. So you've been warned.

Ps. The duck curry is not on their menu. You have to ask for this dish specifically. Remember to check with the staff on the price. I remember I was a little shocked when I saw the bill.

Second visit:
Decide to come here and try out their lunch specials. Ordered the beef noodle soup (pho) and omg, bad decision. As we know, the broth is the backbone of any kind of noodle soup and my beef noodle soup was literally drowned in salt. I could feel the sodium kicking into my system and it did not go well with me at all. Other than the sodium laden broth, I honestly cannot remember anything else about my dish. My friends who ordered other dishes (I can't recall what their orders were now) were also complaining about their food, although i can't quite remember what their complaints were. Overall, none of us enjoyed our lunch experience that afternoon. 

Service was good, and that's probably why I gave this place a 3-star. After my second visit, I think I am just going to have to stick to only my duck curry from now on. That is how traumatized I've become after having that beef noodle soup.",3

It's a little hidden gem that hardly ever seems busy but wow! The food is great, I keep going back to either the Pad Thai or the fried rice, they are both fantastic! The service is phenomenal and the owner is almost always in the restaurant and knows many of his customers by face, if not name. Be ware though, when they say spicy..they mean SPICY! A spicy level 2 there is comparable to a 5 at other Asian places..so a 10 is hot hot hot! Definitely my favorite Thai restaurant by far!",5

My friends and I came in for lunch on a recent Friday after a morning of training; food tastes even better when it's recovery food, IMHO.  The lunch specials are still a good option. We shared the still fabulously refreshing tiger shrimp mango salad and I had the chicken panang lunch.  My only gripe is that brown rice is $2.50; really?  I am not willing to pay that much.  Other than that, I still love this place and I really won't wait so long to eat here again.",5

Whatever spice lvl you're used to getting, go down about 2-3. I thought I was manly and got a lvl 8 pad-see-ew... was literally tearing, my friend had a good laugh. It depends on the dish though as my friends chicken was fine (also an 8). Definitely recommend if your into Thai food",4

I was dining solo, and on Durango so I figured  would take my fellow Elite yelper Shawn's recommendation for Thai. I walked into Pan Asian and was greeted and told to sit anywhere. As I went over the menu, I couldn't help but hear the table of 6 across from me talk about this place and ""their spice level"". One guy said how he won't go over a level 5. 
If you know me, and spicy, I was instantly intrigued! I ordered some pot stickers (some of the best I have ever had) and the order of garlic and black pepper chicken, level 8. The boss/server guy looked at me and said ""here, level 8 is very spicy, not like other Thai"" I simply looked back, smiled, and said ""GOOD.""
When my plate arrived I could see the spicy. I started to get a bit nervous but then brushed it off. I was there alone, and I just told the boss I can handle it, can't wimp out now! 
It was perfection! Yes I may have ordered a 2nd Thai iced tea, and my eyes may have been a bit watery at times. But did I finish it? YES. Will I order it again? HELL YES. 
I love being the white girl who impresses the old Thai people. When my guy came to check on me he asked if it was too spicy, I told him it indeed was spicy, but perfectly spicy.

Be warned of the spice rating here, a level 10 is REALLY hot. My brother who is a spice fanatic has actually requested a level 20 dish which Dave accommodated!

The owners are very kind and take great care in making sure the customer has a good experience.

One last thing:  be careful with the spice levels.  I had to convince Mr. Wong into letting me have the panang curry at level 5.  It was probably the equivalent of a 7 or 8 at other places in town.  My parents had take out recently and ordered at level 7 - that couldn't have gone well!  :)

I had a truly outstanding Masaman curry, and there was a great mix of casual and fine dining atmospheres.

I completely fell in love with some of the menu items and others I probably wouldn't order again. 

In Love- Beef Pho was ridiculously good, the broth was well balanced we ordered a spice level of 3 and it was perfect. Basil Fried Rice easily the best fried rice I've had since moving to Vegas it wasn't dry and it was full of flavor spice level 4. Pad Thai was delicious we ordered a 4 but ended up adding additional chili powder and hot sauce. We should've ordered a 6 or a 7 but once again the flavors were oh soo good.

Tried but didn't love it- Tom Yum soup spice level of 2, this could be just me but something was very bland about this dish compared to my local joint. Gyoza, don't get me wrong it was good with a nice crispy exterior and moist filling but it wasn't amazing. Massaman curry spice level 4 we added lots more chili powder once again this was a great dish but it didn't stand out amongst the many other times I've ordered it. 

Side note- they were out of the mango sticky rice dessert. 

Overall I will definitely come back to order my favorites here and I'm not scared to kick up the spice level next time either. They keep the water coming during your meal so don't be skeered.",4

This is a miss. Friendly staff that aims to please, but they can not make up for the size of the smaller portions, and lower quality of the ingredients.

My Asian wife ordered the Spicy Basil with Shrimp, so she would have a comparison to Archie's Kitchen.  The Shrimp were noticably smaller and fewer than Archies. The over all portion was smaller, and the taste just was not there.

I tried the Pad Thai. It was just medicore. 

My take, they can get your meal fast, and if you are desparate for take out with a mediocre taste, this is your place.

Honestly, their prices rival a decent Thai place with better atmosphere, but obviously they put profit before pride.  

They are fortunate there is a Church next door, which fills the place up with good hearted youth, who will accept less when it comes to quality, in return for time to fellowship together. This means they will no doubt stay around for a while.",2

I only gave it three stars as the their spiciness scale is crazy! We love spicy food and normally order closer to a 7 or 8 on the 1-10 spicy scale. We got a 4 on the Pho and a 6 on the pad thai and both us could not handle that spiciness. A little fair warning would have been nice.

The food is really good, fresh and a great value for the price. (Enough for dinner and leftovers) However, be very careful about the spice scale, cause it's nuts.

The price was a bit more than I'm used to for picking up some Chinese, but we figured it was for quality and authenticity. 

When we got in, the guy there was SO friendly. It was almost closing time, but he was so enthusiastic about helping us. He even set us up with water while we waited! At this point, I was thinking how this place is shaping up for a 5 star. 

He asked about how spicy we wanted our chicken. I said I wanted mine a little spicy, my girlfriend said not at all. He asked ""0-10?"" And I said...6? He made a shocked face like, no, that's spicy! I remembered the reviews saying this place was spicy, and I said ok ok, 5. I like spicy foods, I eat them frequently, but I don't like to not enjoy eating something cause it burns. I told him ""not TOO spicy"" and he went off to make the food. 

We were impressed because we watched him slice up the fresh veggies for the dish, and everything looked really good. We got home, and my girlfriend tried hers... Delicious! I tried mine... And I thought, huh. This is a 5!?!?

After a few more bites, my mouth was burning. Bad. But whatever, I usually like spicy food, so I figured it was right at the end of my tolerance. I was wrong. After eating some more, my stomach started to bother me, and it messed my stomach up all night. It was SPICY. 

We were very excited to make this our local Chinese place. Although it was more expensive, it appeared to be fresh, the service was friendly, and we liked the atmosphere in the restaurant. However after this experience, I'm going to have to wait awhile before I go back. 

I see other reviews mention this spicy thing. I generally love a place that is brave enough to make their spicy actually spicy. However, if someone is giving you a FIVE out of ten, it shouldn't be so hot it's difficult to eat. Using a scale like that is supposed to be a scale of what the average person considers 0-10, not what they do.... Otherwise it's useless.",3

We tried a variety of dishes and the ones that really stood out to me were the Malaysian Roti and the Tempura Cheesecake!  The roti was crisp and not too greasy.  The curry sauce on the side was full of flavor but I wished it was a tad thicker.  I didn't expect the cheesecake to be as good as it was - the batter was light and the cheesecake was nice and tangy.  

Some other dishes we got were: shrimp salad, fried tofu, basil fried rice, pad see yew, and panang curry.  IMO everything was on the salty side as I feel like I had a gallon of water while I was there.  None of these really stood out to me.  I've had better versions of all these dishes elsewhere.

Pork red curry with pumpkin eggplant bell peppers coconut milk is too sweet for my taste. I want my curry spicier.

We're from Ca and its the best thai food we've ever had.  Its the closest thing to authentic food in Thailand.,5
1215141,MbuwJgJBQTbtf1tN9nlyMw,8HCC8NuJmdHnEg2XC00NPg,This place is just OK.  Not part of my regular rotation nor is it a go to place for thai food.,3

It was so good, I wanted to go back the next day but being in Vegas, there's so many other places to try so we didn't go back.  Big mistake. All we could think about was how good this place is.  We had green curry with chicken, the drunken noodles, and chicken with black pepper stir fry.  They were all so darn good, I can't even rank them.  But the black pepper stir fry was the best.  Wish we lived closer...",5

Volcano chicken:  Horrible. Over-fried, crispy, and couldn't taste the chicken. We even had 3 orders of different spicy levels.

Chicken Pad Thai:  Weird. The noodles were pink(??) and had a fishy flavor. The chicken was basically flavorless. 

Chicken Massaman Curry: Just OK. Nothing outstanding. 

Bummer!! We really wanted to like this place, too!",2

She admitted that their menu changed and that they didn't make shrimp with jasmine rice anymore.  She then hung up on me and when I called back, I was hung up on again.

If the menu has changed, please update your website.  Please also train your employees on better customer service.",1
1215145,tYQhVYU9uz0XUkSWaDJILA,8HCC8NuJmdHnEg2XC00NPg,"I feel like I might be swimming against the current on this one, with so many great reviews of this place. I came he with my usual lunch crowd (we all work together) thus right off the bat we asked for separate checks and was told no problem. The special was volcano chicken so three of us ordered that and one ordered the yellow curry and the last ordered Chicken Pad Thai. Well the Volcano chicken was atrocious, it was sooooo overcooked I couldn't taste any chicken, I swear when I say it tasted like glazed pork rinds. My jaw hurt from crunching so much. Everyone that got the Volcano Chicken had the same issue. My friends Pad Thai came out pink?? And smelled and tasted like fish.. he took two bites and pushed it aside. When the check came they forgot to give us separate checks and a overcharge and refund later we finally got out of there.

Not sure if there was a new cook or the what, but this is one place that will not get a second chance from me, and I love Asian food.",1

When the food finally came out, the girl that bagged up the boxes took even longer! Sometimes you don't need to take your sweet time! 

If you can imagine being on the verge of almost missing a flight and waiting for this food... it was a horrifying experience. The curry was good, the Pad See Ew was okay. Not worth the wait unless you have all the time in the world..",2

NOTE

The portions are large
The portions are pretty
When they say spicy, it is DEFINITELY spicy!
The prices are terrific
The service is friendly
The parking is easy to find

What more do you need? 

**Keep in mind, however, that this place aims to please all people, not just certain cultures.  In other words, there is definitely more flavor in the meals than you would expect and not as ""organic"" as one might find overseas.  Is it still tasty?  Of course, YES.**",5
1215148,UeTOnkW9tbhETyrnEZP5dA,8HCC8NuJmdHnEg2XC00NPg,"Unbelievable! I am kicking myself right now for not reading the most recent reviews of this place! They all agree with me, appalling taste and upsetting execution.

How is it possible that every single dish we ordered tonight was an awful and tasteless disaster! They must of hired a new chef. That's the only explanation for this. Pan Asian, how do you go from having a near perfect review on yelp and start to slip this drastically? Everything was beyond unacceptable. You have been checked off on my list of the worst thai food I have ever had in my life.

First offense: The chicken pad thai was an unnatural pink? The chicken looked like dried overcooked salmon - it was pink! The noodles were beyond over cooked to the point where they were hard, all stuck together in blocks and then broke up into a million of little pieces when you would try to pick them up. There was no sauce at all, not even soaked into the pad thai noodles. It was so dry! So crazy dry. There was no flavor at all - not even a hint of fish sauce, sweetness, sourness, or anything! 

Second offense: The pad see ew with beef noodles were also stuck together like bricks, dried out and hard. Also, why did the only flavor we taste was oil and extra black pepper? Did they run out of oyster sauce, sweet soy sauce, sugar, fish sauce, all of the traditional ingredients that go into this dish? I could not handle eating oil flavored noodles with extreme black pepper. Into the trash it goes. 

Third offense: The green curry with beef had the consistency of tom yum soup. I don't understand how they can make a curry so watery! I did not taste any of the deep flavors you would typically find in curry, (no lemongrass, no richness, no sweetness) except for spicy. Spicy water would best explain this dish. To add insult to injury, they offered us a minimal amount of chewy beef pieces and loaded up on undercooked and hard vegetables. Cutting costs much?

What upsets me the most, was that the owner David Wong was there and he allowed these dishes to be served to us. That was his stamp of negligence. There is no quality or control here. 

We ate 4 bites and could not get past how incredibly shoddy all of these dishes were prepared. I'm seriously upset that we spent$40 on all of this dried out, bland food. The joke is on us. I would typically give restaurants a second chance. But not this place, never again.",1
1215149,uLa7jetZ-t_oosre04OE9A,8HCC8NuJmdHnEg2XC00NPg,How do they get 5 stars? My fiancé was disappointed as well. The funkiest looking pad Thai ever.,1
1215150,adcbxg4hiVk1N8aRQTDeyQ,8HCC8NuJmdHnEg2XC00NPg,"I find that I imagine eating here on a regular basis. The food is that delicious. David is highly personable and makes it fun to eat there.

Jokes like ""My wife is very angry today - food will be very spicy"" - classic stuff and I love it.",5
1215151,5DEL4M3p7Li1j2tV99DdIQ,8HCC8NuJmdHnEg2XC00NPg,"Place has potential I think, as closed, possibly for a menu and kitchen overhaul where not every dish tastes the same or nothing. Tried twice, green curry was swimming w not much on the beef and veg front, possibly catering to the toothless. Singapore noodles were bland. Had some other take out dishes that were unmemorable. Was a shame as had decent ratings but was last there 6 mos ago. 

Tip would be to not try to put too much on the menu and focus on what food is your talent. Specialising in such a broad array of Asian food is signing yourself up for trouble. You will have better success narrowing down menu with your strengths and not throw items on you believe will be a draw for people when in fact it detracts.",2
1215152,xpGz8GDeeESqGDfCDB0JMA,8HCC8NuJmdHnEg2XC00NPg,Thanks to the great reviews on yelp I decided to give Pan Asia a try. Walked in and was immediately greeted by David! he helped me understand exactly what I was ordering since it was my first time there. After 10-15 minutes food came right out. Ended up loving everything I ordered. Few days later Took my mom to try it out might I mention she is a very picky eater but I knew she would love this place and she did!,5
1215153,AQndGktCiwpXXXlUrChlGw,8HCC8NuJmdHnEg2XC00NPg,Ehhh. I agree with the lower reviews.  the people were really nice but My pad Thai chicken should not have been pink! didn't quite have that pad Thai taste I was looking for.  The restaurant was dingy and decor was underwhelming. 2.5 for the service and quick cook time.,2

I went there on a Thursday evening and the restaurant was empty, the owner took my order and the food was pretty good. I also received good service and refilled my drink without asking. I had the coconut shrimp as my appetizer, a nice large shrimp dredged in coconut flour then fried to a golden crisp. I also has a small bowl of filet mignon pho which was quite tasty with really good flavored broth. My main dish was garlic pepper shrimp with vegis, it was good but for me the coconut shrimp and the pho was the star. All three dishes including and ice tea was $30. I did notice some cheap lunch specials there between 11am to 3pm.",4

I actually had my lunch in  Retail outlets which was fab food and healthy with veggies and rice at $6 i guess. I didn't order to go considering i will get something at the strip at dinner time. However i guess i should have picked from there. Here i paid $9.67, not good food, with very less vegetables and less portions.I was better of doing junk at Mac D's opposite Caesars Forum Shops.",2

We ordered the shrimp Panang curry, pineapple fried rice, pad Thai, pho, wonton soup and each order was  amazingly delicious. An explosion of flavours! Careful with the spicy levels. I eat Habaneros like candy and considered a number 5 to be  mild. The service was great! The owner was super friendly. Wish this place was in Los Angeles.",5
1215160,eXbL9rdfD8WjO2mHbzodGg,8HCC8NuJmdHnEg2XC00NPg,"So this place has been open for a while, but I just recently discovered it. It was very delicious! David Wong is the owner of this place and he has done an amazing job. The interior design of the restaurant is very nice and the menu is very large with lots of options. The Malaysian Roti was made to the right texture and it was super delicious. The Chicken Satay was so moist and perfect! The Mango Salad is the best here, they are not stingy. The Filet Mignon Noodle Soup was really good because the meat was very soft. The Pad Thai was not my favorite though, I was actually disappointed, it's not bad, but it didn't stand out to me. Lastly we had Fried Banana w/ Ice Cream, and I didn't like it because there was coconut flakes in it and they use plantains and so it wasn't very tasty, I like it sweeter. But it was okay because David gave me extra fried banana because he said I was too skinny, haha! Overall, this place is a really good thai restaurant. I wonder why not that many people know about it. I will be coming back often:)",4

Service was fast quick and the price wasn't too bad for me either. Good stuff.",5

The pad Thai is the best I've ever had and the beef pho with garlic is killer. Also love to order the panang chicken for lunch, super tasty! Make sure you don't order it too spicy because they don't mess around when it comes to spice. I love spicy food but find myself at about a level 3 for spice when I'm here. Definitely a gem!!

Their panang curry has pretty much set the standard for Curry I Crave. The chunks of vegetables are huge, and everything is perfectly cooked; no mushy potato but crunchy carrot. Everything's perfect. Caveat: I am a big fat wuss when it comes to spice, so while it might be too mild for some, it's just mild enough that I can sweat through it, but actually finish everything.

Great place for takeout, too, since they are very quick!

They are a little on the steep side for neighborhood asian food, but they are so high quality, and so unlikely to make my tummy upset, it's pretty much worth it.",4

The spice levels are no joke, with a level 8 on Pad See Ew burning my tongue a good amount. Oddly enough, I found it had more kick to me than my friend's spice level 10 linguini, but less of a smoky flavor. The Pad See Ew is well made here, and I have nothing to criticize on it.

The service was prompt and friendly enough, with the chef coming and asking us if we were okay with the spice level a couple of times. Several times people came in and were known by name, always a nice touch for the regulars. If this place was closer to me, I'm sure I'd have been here many times by now.

The only criticism I would have was that the thai ice tea that my friend ordered was too sweet and didn't have enough tea flavor. It was a point of mediocrity in an otherwise budget-friendly and taste-friendly meal.",4

At first, I was hesitate to try it because on yelp, it is listed as Japanese, Chinese, and Thai. I'm never really a fan of restaurants where they have more than one cuisines. However, after I tried this place, I'm happy that I gave this place a shot. This place is a Thai restaurant for sure. The first time I came here was for takeout. I have just went back few days ago for dining in and had a great experience. Although I do not agree with other reviews that this place has the best Thai good in town, I will return and try other stuff on the menu. 

Food

Appetizer
1. Mango salad with grill tiger shrimp (4.5/5)
Love mixture flavor of all ingredients in this dish. It's a great dish to start. 
2. Coconut shrimp (4/5)
My dad loved this dish. It was seasoned and fried nicely
3. Crispy Shrimp spring roll (3/4)
It was nothing out of ordinary and I couldn't taste much shrimp in the egg roll.
4. Seafood Tom Yum (3/5)
Seafood was fresh but the soup base was not flavored enough with lemongrass and other spice.

Entrees 
1. Curry duck (3/5)
I was not a fan of their curry duck. Sauce was not flavored enough and duck was not as fresh as I like. 
2. Pork rib with xo sauce (4/5)
This dish was flavorful with lots of garlic. However I would like it to be cut into smaller pieces for the convenience reason.  
3. Pad kee Mao (4/5)
This dish was well seasoned and yummy. I wish they would add more veggie though. 
4. Pineapple fried rice (4/5)
Decent fried rice. 

Service (4.5)

David Wong's service was great and very attentive. :)",4
1215175,yhnhu0B1JSTqlHAy46NlVg,8HCC8NuJmdHnEg2XC00NPg,Family owned. The Pho was delish.  But when they say something is spicy believe them. Awesome.  This is our new Friday lunch spot,5
1215176,hkQVOA-W2yAifXySpTMFnA,8HCC8NuJmdHnEg2XC00NPg,"New favorite restaurant! 

I was on the hunt for spicy food, some of my fellow yelpers recommended this place so I decided to give Pan Asian a try. 

As a starter we ordered the Gyoza, it was good, crispy on the outside and soft and delicious on the inside. 

For my main meal I ordered the linguini noodles with chicken, my palate is very sensitive so on the scale of 1 to 10 of spiciness I ordered a 2. Let's just say I'm ordering a 1 next time. The noodles were amazing though, they were packed with a lot of flavor and a great amount of kick, my nose was running like niagara falls the entire meal. I'm not sure what noodles my husband ordered but he did order the noodles a level 8, he said he liked them as well but was expecting the noodles to be spicier, he's going with a level 10 next time. 

For dessert we ordered the deep fried cheesecake, it's like a slice of Heaven in your mouth, its so rich and creamy and it's served with whipped cream and ice cream. 

Overall we loved our entire meal, and the staff was extremely friendly! Plus it's inexpensive, for an appetizer, two entrees, two drinks, and dessert, we only spent $38. I highly recommend Pan Asian, I can't wait to come again and try more of their dishes.",5
1215177,IIgQeRnpcUmaL3XK_OACpg,8HCC8NuJmdHnEg2XC00NPg,"Well tried this on a whim.  The description says Japanese, Chinese and Thai. The only thing Japanese was the gyozas. It's prodominatly Thai. So don't come here thinking they have anything Japanese or Chinese.

The place was small so not great for large groups. They had portable heaters to heat the dining area. Not very classy but you do what you gotta do.
The food was good. The fried calamari was ok, they could of used fresher oil. The Vietnamese shrimp ravioli were awesome. Very fresh and had a real good flavor.
The drunken noodles were definitely drunk in oil. 
I don't know if I'd go out of my way to come here again but if I'm in the area it may be considered.
The chef were very friendly and they had their regulars. 
All in all it wasn't a bad first visit.",3

Our group  tried the Papaya salad, (they were happy w/) and the big hit was the Tiger Shrimp Mango Salad, which I had everyone taste and the all loved.  The only thing I would complain about is no liquor available for sale;(",4

I ordered it at a spice level of ""2"". I'm a heat wimp, so this was actually still a bit much for me, but it sure cleared the sinuses! 

My friend ordered the chicken rice noodle soup (but he kept poaching from my bowl, so the clear star of this dining experience was indeed the pho).

We had the calamari for an appetizer and it was so tender and fresh, not a bit chewy at all......
The Filet Mignon Pho was delish! Flavor was really great! Lots of tender filet noodles and super spicy just like I wanted! 
My husband ordered the Duck w/Curry sauce. I had saw this dish on Yelp and my husband was excited to try it. When we were looking over the menu I couldn't find it anywhere. The waitress said 'oh yes we have it', 
I am not sure why it isn't on their menu???? 

I saw so many dishes I want to try........ Singapore Noodles.... Pad See Yew...... Drunken Noodle...... ALL look amazing!!!

I love spice so I ordered a spicy level 5 after the waitress warned us that their food was on the spicier side. (I usually get a 6 or 7) The spice was perfect for me!

I love the preserved egg congee and pork.  Their fish congee was just ok, the fish smelled and tasted slightly fishy....  The congee is the thick style and it's like $4 for a big bowl.

1221425,353AiqG5PYLZu2xvcZE7uA,MhMFi7hae_KsaK8lHcg0iQ,"My boyfriend and I were visiting Vegas, and as we were driving up there he was telling me about this great restaurant called Big Wong he's been hearing about from a friend. We decided we would give it a shot due to all the great reviews we read about.. 
When we got there, there was a hostess/waitress who looked really irritated to see us. She promptly sat us down and we said thanks and she doesn't even acknowledge it, just walks off. I was a little put off by the service but I just shrugged it off. We looked at the menu and we ordered a plate of the chicken wings to share between us, the beef ramen for my boyfriend, the double
Fish ball noodle soup for me, and two Thai teas. 
We got our drinks in a styrofoam cup. It was weird but I guess that's their norm. I drank it pretty quickly since it was small, and had to ask for a water within 5 minutes. Also a styrofoam cup. 
We then got our food. My boyfriend thought his ramen was okay, nothing special. I thought my noodle soup was bland beyond words. The soup tasted really watered down, I had to put in a ton of sriracha to give it any flavor at all. The wings were really good though, that was worth every penny. 

Some things bugged me a little during our visit there though. The kitchen is within full view to the restaurant which means I can hear the staff in there talking. At one point, I heard one of the guys in there raise his voice to another guy about not working hard enough? It was pretty loud and was a little unprofessional. 
Also, the waitress who was unfriendly the whole time, was on the verge of unpleasant. She seemed like she didn't want to be there serving us the whole time and I felt the negative vibe. 

Overall, this restaurant is cool if you're looking for acceptable quality in the food and cheap prices. Our total bill came out to only $20 so it wasn't bad. Make sure if you do go, try the wings. It'll make the trip worthwhile",2
1221426,Q_TH9rj8TqW4i6NWC6OKpg,MhMFi7hae_KsaK8lHcg0iQ,"I really like Big Wong. 

This is just to help them improve.

Their service sucks.

Everything is about $5 dollars.

The lady who has helped us both times is always alone. I'm sure it sucks for her. This is a prime location in the surrounding China Town area so I know it gets busy. There's about twenty people in here now. 

Anyways the food I really good. I've had their special spicy seafood soup with wontons and their beef ramen. Both were pretty good. The shrimp and wontons in the soup were of good quality. The beef ramen has a pretty basic beef flavor. There isn't even any taste of like ginger or even onion. The beef itself is cooked really soft. I've tried their chicken wings and their shrimp won tons. Both were good. The wings are seasoned well and came out hot quick and fresh. The shrimp wontons are also good. Both are good sizes for $5 each.

Anyways they give you super small water cups.

So here is my gripe. They have a menu item called 5., 5a, and 5b. It's their special deep fried chicken. One is bone in dark meat, One is bone out dark meat, and they have a boneless white meat. The dish is really good. The dark meat takes 25 minutes but it's worth it. 

So my sister got the bone out dark and my cousin the bone out white meat.

The server comes out and brings pork chops. So we spoke amongst ourselves like who ordered this?

And she's like it's number three deep fried pork chops.

I ordered soup so I know it's not mine.

But we are all positive that they got chicken.

She just walks off and says well you ordered that and shrugs her shoulders and walks off.

No arguing with that right?

So she ends up walking back and says it's wrong it goes somewhere else.

Needless to say she messed up.

There was no apology for the mix up or for blaming us.

Also we never got our drinks refilled. Not once.

Anyways I'll probably just order take out from here. I can't imaging coming here when their service sucks. 

Also I witnessed her have an attitude with another client because they requested a specific table for their large party. 

3.5-4 stars for the food and price but 2 overall.",2
1221427,zgapOrOWhiXIaMoGeZPCvA,MhMFi7hae_KsaK8lHcg0iQ,"I totally echoed with some other reviewers, the service really sucked there! They never smiled and sometimes I feel that customers are paying them to treat customers badly. It's like they don't care if you give them business or not. The price is very attractive but then after visting there for couple times, I eventually figured that it's not worth it because I never ate comfortably in the restaurant when their faces (the only lady who served customers and the kitchen staff, especially the female cook) always look upset. Why can't they smile a little more? Like another reviewer said, we always said thank you, when being seated, when the drinks came, when the food came, we said thank you. But there was no acknowledgement of our thanks, and the face was like ""whatever"".

The first time I went there I asked very politely if they have a bathroom (i asked after placing orders), and the lady was giving me an irritated look, as if I was a fool to ask.

I think the food is cheap because they only have so few employees there. And I guess that's why there is no good service, I think anyone could go postal if one has to do everything with no help. I did see that ""only lady"" taking orders, serving drinks, bringing out food, sweeping the floor, etc, all by herself. Poor thing.....and poor customers too. I guess that's why the ""only lady"" always has an irritated face. Though I can be empathetic, I still disagree with such kind of service. But I still can't figure out why the female cook has an irritated face. The male cook doesn't have an irritated look. But then he works in the kitchen mostly, so can't really compensate the unpleasant aura caused by the other 2 ladies. By the way, the female cook doesn't come out often either, but for that one time she did came out, she looked at me as if I was an eye sore for her, and I was just eating, not doing anything wrong though.

I think I would rather be starved instead of going back again....way too much discomfort to eat with that unpleasant aura. It's not worth it though the food is cheap.",2
1221428,t2grMHLECUnJDhein15AUQ,MhMFi7hae_KsaK8lHcg0iQ,"I wish I had tried this place sooner! It really is awesome food for Decent prices. I really enjoyed the Curry and the rice. The service was quick. It feels like a nice family-run casual place. 

I do have one complaint... The layout of this joint! It was a chilly evening and the door kept opening so guests could come and go. I was FREEZING! I even wore my winter jacket the whole time. I probably wont go back until it is nicer weather.",4
1221429,7nBZoWslfqZIVK8_o0gc1w,MhMFi7hae_KsaK8lHcg0iQ,"Good eats for such a cheap price!

Almost everything on their menu is about $5, give or take a little.
Don't come here expecting the best customer service- lady up front I've seen is running around by herself, so don't be too harsh. The hearty food and low price that goes along with it makes up for their lack of customer service. Everything I tried (Hoi Nam chicken w/ seasoned rice, won ton soup, salt and pepper wings (YUM), and curry with roti) was surprisingly authentic tasting.
Definitely fulfills your craving for Asian food without putting a dent in your wallet. I'm more than satisfied! Will be back for the salt and pepper wings!
Not taking their customer service into consideration, 5 stars for food and affordability.",5
1221430,JmcbX_PkBdMom6ehMuUK5w,MhMFi7hae_KsaK8lHcg0iQ,Amazing curry chicken & roti. The pepper chicken wings were great. Shrimp fried wonton was hot and fresh. Nice big juicy steak on the new menu was done perfectly. All this under $25... Aaaa-freaking-mazing !,5
1221431,hypeHXloyHM4A-EK4kYIAA,MhMFi7hae_KsaK8lHcg0iQ,"Crazy cheap. We almost felt bad for not ordering more food because it was so cheap, but we weren't that hungry. The curry beef was so good because it had both a Hong Kong and Malaysian flare to it. It reminded me a lot of beef rendang which is my absolute favorite. My wife's pork chop over rice was only decent but cost less $5 so hard to complain. The place is very clean and all the dishes people were ordering looked and smelled great. The lady working the front could be a little friendlier and smile more. Other than that we were pleasantly surprised with this small hole in the wall.",3
1221432,mQN561VAgSK3VHj8fioOVg,MhMFi7hae_KsaK8lHcg0iQ,"Guilty pleasures. We all have guilty pleasures. And my guilty pleasure is Big Wong. 

....
....
....

Not that Big Wong! Get your mind out of the gutter! 

I'm talking about Big Wong, the unassuming Chinese/Malaysian restaurant in the Seoul Plaza (across from Snowflake Shavery). 

This place is crazy cheap, like 1982-prices cheap. So cheap... yes, I've wondered, what is making the ""Special"" Shrimp Soup so special. Yeah well, I'll take the risk because the food is absolutely delicious! 

I've only been there twice but they have over 32 items on their menu and I'll be updating this review often. I will try their entire menu, since most items are less than $5!!! What? And the portions are not tapa portion but are full-size portions, good enough to feed an adult for dinner. 

I LOVE their Curry Beef over rice. I can't pinpoint the country of the curry, it's a cross between Japanese Curry (I'm thinking House brand) but not as strong, and  panang or a masala. The curry has tender chunks of beef and is served simply over rice or roti. It is delicious.  

Roti's are flat flour pancakes and they are delicious. I'm committing a faux pas by saying this but it reminds me of Fausto's flour tortillas. It has that delicious glutenous flavor. The sweeten roti has condensed milk and makes for a nice dessert. 

The Shrimp wonton soup with flat rice noodles are excellent too. They make great shrimp wontons. 

Honorable mention is the fried porkchop over rice (served with a 5-spice flavored gravy). Tasty but not my favorite item on the menu. I like their mango pudding too. You get a good portion for $1.25 and it has bits of real mango. 

Can't wait to go again. At these prices, I can afford to eat here every day! The Munchie Box has nothing on Big Wong (the munchie box at Jack-in-the-Box, get your mind out of the gutter)!",5
1221433,YVKikAYXquQ38jrL8V9Z8Q,MhMFi7hae_KsaK8lHcg0iQ,"Like every other review here, food is definitely delicious, and kudos to the chefs.

But because the food is priced so right, and the plaza is booming from the other restaurants.. business is picking up and service is completely nonexistent.

Sorry lady, please don't be too danm miseriable, the energy is not good. They need to hire a few teenagers to help run the business or something.  As good as anybody can be, being the hostess, server, busser, cashier and trying to answer the phone is plain ridiculous.

Add some music or a tv for some noise, the silence makes waiting more irritating.. 

Sorry for the rant but a business establishment needs to run efficiently in other for the customer to be satisfied

5 stars for the food, but overall experience: 3 stars",3
1221434,Xs_i6_9PXoAzSu0vQXnr2A,MhMFi7hae_KsaK8lHcg0iQ,"Big Wong is probably one of the best places to go for a meal if you wanna get full by not having to spend a lot of money. Everything on the menu is no more than $8 or $9. You get a big portion for whatever you get as well. 

If you ever decide to come here I suggest the chicken curry with roti pancakes and or rice. Their curry is SO GOOD. The salt and pepper chicken wings are also appetizing. 

Everything here is like comfort food! Try it out!",3
1221435,eRCCViFLmyiRIvLjl1fzag,MhMFi7hae_KsaK8lHcg0iQ,"Probably my favorite curry place because it is affordable, tasty, and filling. I haven't tried a lot of their other items because I only come here for the curry, but their vegetables are also very tasty. I recommend ordering the Bok Choy with your curry.

Their curry has the perfect amount of spice for me and a good ratio of meat/potatoes/rice. I usually get the beef curry or chicken curry w/ roti pancakes (only 4.95)

Now I have read that people don't really get the best service here, which is true. Personally, I just come here to quickly satisfy my curry craving and the food comes out so fast that I don't even care about extra service. This place is definitely worth the price and even if you don't like it, your wallet won't be crying.",3
1221436,xOS2oI5t7hZtFgWYSWz2SA,MhMFi7hae_KsaK8lHcg0iQ,"The food is very good and the price is very decent. 

The only thing is be prepared for a the sour mood by the lady working there. The service is actually good but the attitude is less than desirable. 

Just imagine your mom having a sucky day at work and then having to come home to cook dinner and you'll get the idea. You'd almost rather order pizza if not for the fact that the cooking is so good.

There would be 5 stars if not for the foul mood.",4
1221437,XatNFRqhU4-EvxaJtv0hmg,MhMFi7hae_KsaK8lHcg0iQ,AMAZING FOOD! Highly recommend the shrimp wontons and the Thai tea. We had the fried chicken and noodle and the hoi nam chicken and both were delicious. Great service and very authentic food. And for the price? You cannot go wrong coming here!! I will be back next time I'm in Vegas!  Oh and don't forget the sweetened roti!,5
1221438,E93UkAAnu4tDxL7cByKsYg,MhMFi7hae_KsaK8lHcg0iQ,"Big Wong is one of the best ways to get a $4.95 lunch in Vegas. 
Most of the menu is $5.00 and under. 

Price. Price. Price.

If that's what drives you come here. 

I ordered the shrimp wonton soup with udon noodle. I found the broth to be too lightly flavored, but there was plenty of shrimp packed wontons and noodles to fill up. 

None of the food at our table was spectacular, but all of the dishes were fine.

I may have judged this place too harshly, but it's hard to eat mediocre food when the best ramen in Vegas (Monta Ramen) and one of the best Japanese restaurants (Raku) are in the same shopping center for only a few dollars more.

I will certainly try Big Wong again and try not to dream of tonkatsu ramen.",3

The average price is $6, and there is everything from curry, hainam chicken rice, fried pork chop rice to vegetarian and seafood options.

I ordered the pork chop rice which came with a side of this amazing dipping sauce, pickled vegetables and a hard boiled egg.  Yum! 

My husband ordered the curry beef which was rich in flavor and good portion size. The two of us are here for about 10 bucks and walked away happy and stuffed.",4
1221441,fYVnj45-rcuEDkUyenBdUg,MhMFi7hae_KsaK8lHcg0iQ,"First time visit was alright. I got the ramen w/ the fried chicken. The broth of the soup was unflavorful and tastes almost as water. But if you add the fried chicken in it, it gets better. I don't know if thats normal or not but overall it was pretty good. The staff doesnt really say anything or gives a greeting, or checks up on you while you're eating. You just do your own thing but I think thats expected since it is Chinatown. I'd come back though to try an entree w/ rice. :)",4

Had those two dishes in a garlic sauce. Also had thai iced tea, hai nam chicken, and a seafood ramen noodle bowl. Hai nam chicken was a tad bit too dry, but was pleased overall. They also ran out of the special Chinese chicken, Chinese sausage, and mushrooms noodle bowl!!! My total came out to be around $25.

A good alternative if the line at Monta ramen is too long.  However I have to warn you that the flavor was a bit bland. . But for the price it really can't be beat.",3

The decor is nothing, and the inside is pretty bland, but the food makes up for it.  The beef ramen is always a safe pick as well as the fried chicken with rice.

Was staying down the road to Big Wongs so decided to give it a try for brunch. First impression is a very dingey looking asian joint, but that was quickly dismissed once we got the food. 

We ordered fried pork chop/rice and a hainan chicken/rice for only $4.95 each! Cant really go wrong!

Prices are cheap, that's for sure, but they're definitely lacking in the flavor profiles of some dishes.

We ventured here for lunch and had a Shrimp Wonton Egg Noodle Soup, Hainan Chicken with Rice, Gai Lan with Garlic, and the Curry with Roti.

The Shrimp Wonton were OK, but nothing else special about the noodle soup.

Hainan Chicken lacked flavor and was dry.  The rice didn't have that great hainan chicken flavor to it and the sauces they gave were just a spicy sauce and what seemed to be the soy sauce chicken marinade.

The Gai Lan was good with lots of garlic.

The Curry with Roti might have had to be the best dish.

They were out of a lot of things, but not going to ding them on that.  I'm not sure if they even had the items, it would have changed my mind much.",2

Service is attentive and food is out quick.
Soups are all fabulous: the wonton skins used are not cheap and the quality is evident when you bite into the shrimp-packed parcels. Broth was very flavorful and had just a bit of a spicy kick to it. Strongly prefer the udon noodles to the ramen noodles that are your other option. Both the WONTON SOUP and the HOUSE SEAFOOD NOODLE SOUP are good picks.

BEEF STEW is hearty and delicious, and the gravy had undertones of flavor that were reminiscent of pho. Not sure if they include bone broth in the gravy or if it's a particular aromatic, but the gravy had good flavor and the meat was tender.
STEAMED CHICKEN WITH MUSHROOMS AND SAUSAGE is a solid, filling dish, served with rice and greens. Flavorful sauce is light, sausage is salty, and flavors complement one another for a balanced dish.
SALT AND PEPPER WINGS are very salty and very peppery. Pretty sure this is not a dish you could order by itself, as even to eat just three of them I had to space out bites of wing with that of other dishes- if you have HBP you might want to steer clear, as the salt in this dish was quite high.

Vegetable dishes here are solid: the baby bok choy in garlic sauce is my favorite (second only to the one at Ichiza but the portion here is  three times the size), and the Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce is a staple as well.",4

She treats people like she hates her life or something. I have taken my family there for over 2 years or so, maybe once a month. She was rude starting day one, we ignore it, hoping that she becomes more polite. But she's the most horrible server.  Her energy is almost hateful. You have to make a loud noise to request any attention from her and sometimes that is not enough, she will ignore you talking to her sometime as well, and then you have to get up and go to her with any request, including if you want to order extra food. She never ask if you need anything, she acts like she's pissed off even when you try to pay. I feel a little sorry for the owner, she is costing him money because if people want to order extra food, his restaurant will profit more but the waitress always treats you like she's angry if you ask her for anything, including ordering or paying your bill. I guess losing profit is what he deserves, he's responsible for her being there. Her bad attitude is weird because it never change even though we keep being nice to her and even give her good tips, hoping she will realize what's going on but it doesn't work, she just always remains rude.

I ended up going to Big Wongs earlier today. I  order a few things. The shrimp wontons I order and then I order the fish balls, then the deep fried pork on white rice, then I order the beef noodle ramen. I'm not that impress. I see why it's cheap cause you get what you order from the price range. The beef ramen has a strange weird smell and taste. Its fresh but it just had that strange taste and smell. The fish balls wasn't real fish, it tasted very generic and fake, almost like a hot dog shape like balls, the texture is like the hotdog inside texture. The shrimp wontons are great as I said earlier, the deep fried pork on rice was good. I feel like I wasted money, I spent 24 dollars and I tip them 5 dollars and so altogether 27 dollars. The best thing I like was the food was packed pretty good, nothing will fall out. The food tasted fresh. The lady that took my order didn't have a personality but she wasn't rude and so that's good, a least she wasn't rude but no personality. I guess  this is a learning experience to be careful and do my research on a restaurant first before going over there. Lesson learn for me. It just sucks when you have your hopes up high, in hopes that you will get great food and then you eat the food, to find out the disappointment of wasting money and not enjoying the food that I order. I'm sure they have other great things on the menu but I won't ever be back at that place again. I tasted way better. A least there is some positives about this restaurant. I'm not going to even sweat the negatives thing, I just laugh and keep moving. I'm just thankful to have food. Life goes on, we learn, That's what makes us better people.",2

I expected at least a little spice (had a chili pepper next to it), but the red colored soup was nothing but an illusion of blandness... A lot of toppings though I must say. But that did not make up for the runs I had after consuming 3/4 of the bowl...

The won ton egg noodle soup was the most bland I've ever had - and I had pretty high expectations since this is rated 4 stars on Yelp - disappointing. Everything was subpar except for the shrimp won tons.

If you're looking for dirt cheap food and don't care about the quality, then this is your place. There are definitely other places nearby that serve much better quality and authentic food.

Prices were quite reasonable and we were surprised at the amount of food they give considering that most of the items on the menu are and average of $7/$8 range.

Eats: 
Ong Choy (Thai style) - It's some green veggie that is super crunchy and served on a sizzling plate. I love garlic and they are quite generous with the garlic In this dish! 
Shrimp Wontons - There is hardly any fillers in there, it's almost all shrimp!

If you want take out be sure to call your order in before showing up to avoid being questioned why you didn't call in advance. And when dining in, don't ask for split checks because this just pisses off the lady too and she'll likely tell you off like she did to us. Prices also have gone up in the last few months because they now charge sales tax, whereas before it was always included in the price.

I usually get the same few things when coming here: hoi nam chicken w/ seasoned rice, fried chicken or the chicken wings. I've been avoiding the fried items lately because I'm always told that it takes an extra 20-30 min...is it never prepped in advance? Very odd. The only thing I would NOT recommend getting is the beef ramen because this is a Chinese place and they don't make it right. I think they're only offering it to compete with Monta next door and it's definitely not worth getting despite the cheap $5.95 price tag.

People think this place is fast but it's really not. I'm always waiting a while for my food whether I'm dining in or taking out. There is usually only 1 server and a couple of kitchen staff which is likely why...Not sure why the people working here are always so grouchy...especially the lady that serves the food!",3

Kitchen staff that doubles as wait staff are funny,  friendly and know their food.  I went with two of the favorites.   Salt and pepper chicken wings (#21) and house special spicy shrimp noodle soup with won tons (9a).  You have a choice of three noodles so I went with udon.
The chicken wings were fried well so they had a crispy exterior and gloriously moist interior.   Best wings I had in ages!   8 wings is a good portion.   The soup came out hot and spicy as ordered.   The shrimp were plentiful,  tasty as well as the won tons.  Plenty of Chinese broccoli in the broth added great color and texture.   The soup is served with extra green onions and a bottle of siracha to add heat to your personal preference.   Best of all, this filling meal was only $13. Your money goes far here while your taste buds go on a joy ride!   This place stands on its own even though wedged between the trendy Nakamura Ya and Monta restaurants.",4

This place is like a true hole in the wall restaurant. For $20 dollars, i could get a decent family style meal with some friends. My only complaint is that the curry that i order (what was advertise) was a little under seasoning. To me, it tasted a little water down. But the chicken make up for the curry sauces. I felt like he chicken was the curry it self. But overall all the other dish were great for under $5.",4

Also, being from NYCnand having frequented Big Wong in Chinatown there, I really was hoping to find a restaurant here to call home. I was pretty disappointed. The prices are definitely easy on the wallet but the food was just bleh. The service was also crummy. When I was waiting for my food, the cashier (owner?) was in a heated argument in the kitchen  with the chef, who seemed like a relative. I believe the care that goes into cooking is affected by one's mood so I was  not too thrilled to hear the heated exchange. I may return to give it a second chance though not sure when that'd be.",2

Quality of food is still good and the food comes out quick. Restaurant still looks clean. We had the chicken curry, chicken and rice, and the wonton soup with egg noodles. 

One of the reason why I do not want to come back is because our waiter is not friendly. She never smiles. When we say thank you, she doesn't make eye contact. We use to go very often, but every time we go, it's as if she never met us before. No matter how good the food is, customer service means everything to me.

So I was rewarded with some me time and decided to just drive. My stomach reminded me that it was way past dinner time and I unexpectedly ended up here. After looking at montas storefront with the crowds and long waits I figured, why is nobody giving Big Wong some love? I looked in my wallet and I had a crisp $10 bill waiting to be spent so I said to myself why not?

Now  I'm not Chinese but if I were I would assume that this is pretty much comfort food. I had their fried chicken over seasoned rice($1extra) and it sure hit the spot. It takes longer to cook the dark meat(about15 minutes) but I was ok with it. You get a generous portion of whatever ever dish you get. So far I've only had the fried porkchop over rice, hoinam chicken over rice, and the fried chicken over rice. I'll be coming back because I feel I should try everything on the menu especially the fried wonton shrimp. Some people across from my table was having that and I was compelled to ask those strangers if I can try a piece lol. But alas, I did not.

The guy at the register is a no frills no bs server. You come in, you order, you eat. Sometimes that's just what I need. No bs. Eat here. Give the guy money. And leave with a Happy stomach. A++. Thanks Big Wong. You're always coming through.",5

We got the salt and pepper chicken and the special deep friend chicken over rice. The sauce that came with the latter dish was absolutely AMAZING, I couldn't have enough! We asked for a bowl to bring some home, and the man working so kindly brought us a fresh and warm cup ready to go. The staff is overall super friendly.

When I entered the restaurant I was greeted by a nice lady hostess who is also your waitress! She was pretty nice, the first time I went I ordered to go, it took about 8 minutes which was pretty fast, I ordered peppered chicken wings and deep fried pork with white rice. I ate my food at home and everything was still hot and tasty!

The peppered wings had little bits of jalapeño on them, they were crispy and juicy and a perfect amount of spicy!
The deep fried pork was alright good texture thoroughly cooked, and the rice was the same, like I said previously the amount of food was really great for the price!
It also came with some sort of garlic sauce? I haven't asked what that is but it has a really strong taste, makes the pork even juicier.

The menu is short and sweet with maybe a total of 30 items (15 items per side). The prices are ridiculously cheap- everything is around $5-6. The portions aren't very big though, so I would suggest 1-1.5 dishes per person. 

Everything we ordered happened to only be $4.95/entree ($20 total) and was enough for 3 people:
- Shrimp wonton soup with mustard greens- pretty standard, broth on the lighter side
- Dark Meat Hoi Nam Chicken over Special Seasoned Rice- this is pretty much Hainan chicken, which is cold/room temp chicken served with a delicious chicken broth-flavored rice and dipping sauces of soy sauce and oil and mild chili garlic paste, great portion of chicken, would say they could add more rice though
- Fried salt and pepper chicken wings- comes with some fried pieces of jalapeno, maybe 10-12 wings per plate, pretty flavorful and not too much batter
- Authentic curry chicken with 3 roti pancakes- perhaps my favorite dish. This one is Malaysian curry so it's darker and more liquid than Japanese curry. The curry has dark meat chicken and potatoes. The roti that it comes with is delicious and perfect for dipping in the curry.",4

Big Wong is a small Chinese Restaurant that isn't meant for big parties haha if it were to be described like it is in San Francisco, the interior could resemble easily as a hole in the wall.

The utensils provided, I believe but forgot, are even plastic I think haha water is also served in plastic cups. 

What bun and I enjoy is the Thin Rib Eye with Pasta which also come with potatoes. Dish is about $6.95 I believe and is a hefty portion too. 

Their Special Fried Chicken Dark Meat only isn't bad either. Those would be my two choices.

That got old reeeaaal fast. So I began frequenting somewhere familiar - I had been to Big Wong several times and it was the perfect fit...

The downlow: It's cheap, filling, and tasty.

I don't know what's better than 8 pieces of salt and pepper chicken wings (topped with jalapeños) for 4 dollars. That's 50 cents a wing!! Cheaper than BWW's 60 cent deal and also much larger and more delicious.

Besides the wings, I like to get shrimp wonton soup with egg noodles ($4) or the chicken with rice ($4). You can even choose the cuts of chicken you want, so I always go dark. When I'm eating with others, I like to get the sizzling ong choy ($5) which is a surprisingly HUGE hot plate. It's stir fried morning glory and tastes just like home. Portions are always generous. Seriously, I ordered the shrimp wonton soup thinking it would hold me over until my next meal but it got me stuffed! That little bowl is quite deceiving.

Other notable dishes are the chicken or beef curry, which you can dip roti (Asian crispy pancake) in and the sirloin beef with rice. Pretty much everything you order here will be good or reeeaaally good. It's no-frills food for those that are on a budget. The only thing I don't like that much is the salt and pepper pork because it isn't crispy. 

Fare warning, the service isn't that spectacular. It's always the same lady working as cashier and serving/bussing tables so be patient. Aside from that, her brusque manner of speaking can be off-putting for those that put service as a priority. Bring cash unless you intend on spending a lot (which is nearly impossible).",4
1221514,8rfuPEB5qEx8gsN4ShbHmA,MhMFi7hae_KsaK8lHcg0iQ,"For what it is and what they serve this place rocks. Thanks Yelpers for steering us this direction. We came about 3pm on a Saturday and it wasn't busy at all. Only 5 patrons at the time so our food came out quick. 

From the outside, Big Wong's looks kinda iffy coz it's in a semi-ghetto looking strip mall and the windows are all blacked out. Plus the signage outside makes you think twice but on the inside it's super clean, cute and newer! Yay! Looked more like a café setting than your typical Chinese food place. You can tell they're still messing with their menu coz they have hella neon signs on the wall advertising what's NOT on the plastic menu. They really should just quit playing and invest on new menus. We got:

-Steamed fished 2 large fillets: $9.95 - Very good and super fresh/fluffy like a steamed fish should be like
-Fried Salt Pepper Shrimp: $7.95 - Excellent dish, lots of good sized shrimp for the price and so nicely crispy without being oily. They even cleaned out the head and snipped the ""whisker"" of the shrimp so you could eat it all! 
-Won Ton Noodle Soup - $4.95 - Enough to feed two people with other dishes but was bit underwhelmed by this one. It was good but wasn't exciting. 
-Garlic stir fried Gai Lan- $4.95 - This had to be my favorite dish, it was unbelievably flavorful and came on a sizzling platter. 

Pros:
-CHEAP! Super freshly made food at cheap prices. Cheaper and better than a Panda Express that's for sure.
-Everything was tasty and fresh, good portioned, not too big, not too small but just right.
-Quick service (coz nobody was there)
-Inside is light, bright and clean

Cons:
-No curb appeal but eh, who cares, the inside is nice",4
1221515,2pepsq9OxKfG8lU2oGkxrA,MhMFi7hae_KsaK8lHcg0iQ,"Wow! Super  cheap  prices  and super good food...

I tried the  fried wontons which was all shrimp wontons, egg noodle wontons, and fried chicken wings which was all delicious and $4.95 per portion. Can't  beat the prices and quality of food. I definitely  will be returning to try other dishes.",5
1221516,MpZEwlftjQrHDQeESkSHyw,MhMFi7hae_KsaK8lHcg0iQ,"The menu has the standard Chinese food, nothing fancy.  I asked for the ""largest portion"", and they suggested the chicken curry.  

Pros- authentic Chinese food, speedy service, and low prices.  I told them I was hungry and the dedicated chef(I've seen the same guy cooking every time I've eaten here, making great and consistent dishes) served me my dish right away.  The curry has it's standard delishesness, but unlike other restaurants, this stuff was authentic Hong-Kong-style flavors.  I've tried the wonton noodle, and they gave me the biggest wonton in my soup.  The value of this restaurant is amazing.  (5 stars)

Cons- I can see how people expect a fancy restaurant with Dragon statues and large Chinese symbols to display ""prosperity"", but I'm more about the ""mom and pop"" shops with home-grown flavors that can reminds me of childhood.  (5 stars)",5

Maybe one more...you can't go Wong here!

I'll leave the other jokes about how good Big Wongs feel to someone else!

Onto the review! This is a super casual (read, not fancy), but very affordable restaurant in the Chinatown area. They have lots of choices, and everything we sampled was really tasty!

The chicken curry with roti was delicious. I could have eaten the roti by itself all day long, but the curry was no slouch either!

The shrimp wantons.. .Give me more!! Amazing!

The salt and pepper chicken wings.. You can't go too wrong with chicken wings, but these were great!

We also had the stir fried Chinese broccoli with garlic sauce. Not bad, but nothing to write home about.

As everyone else has said, the prices are VERY affordable, so you can try quite a lot without breaking the bank.",4

-Salt & Pepper pork chop
-Roti & Curry chicken
-2 Wonton soup
-Heinan chicken & rice

The male owner was very nice and attentive. The lady owner was more like straight to the point kind of person, but she wasn't rude or anything. This is a small restaurant with very casual setting, so if you are expecting something fancy this is not it. What is great about this restaurant is that it's located in the strip of local stores next to kungfu boba tea and shave ice. You can go for dessert after your meal without the hassle of finding parking.",4
1221520,7gC9hWPdgH6232WoGLkf7g,MhMFi7hae_KsaK8lHcg0iQ,"I don't know if we went in on an off day but this place was horrible! We were in town for a week and we were craving a good Chinese food place since we live in small town with 1 Chinese food place and it is just as horrible. 

There was 6 of us and we decided to give this place a try after reading reviews, it seemed like a decent place. I kept trying to convince the others to instead go to the Ramen place next door but they were stuck on this place. After eating here they wished they would have listened to me.

We were seated pretty fast, the waitress was kind of rude but no biggie. The prices looked good. We ordered and got our food pretty fast. We all got an order of shrimp wontons, first bite was full of grease and the shrimp was rubbery. I tried the beef ramen, it was no better than the kind you buy at the store for less than a dollar. My friend got a shrimp ramen and everyone who tried it said it tasted like dog food. The chicken wings were OK, not great but OK compared to everything else we ordered. Nobody ate more than a couple bites of what they ordered. 

We joked that if we ever wanted to dine and dash this would be the place as we could not justify paying for the garbage we were presented with. Nonetheless, we made our way to the counter to pay and as we walked passed the other tables there were full plates of food left on almost every table. Guess we weren't the only ones who felt the same. 

We were convinced we were all going to get food poisoning, surprisingly we didn't.",1
1221521,hR3XCv0mbmV8hf1zfGY8LQ,MhMFi7hae_KsaK8lHcg0iQ,"Good, fast, cheap. Authentic Chinese cafe food with items for unfamiliar with ethnic food. Very happy I found this place. Small, simple, but good.",5

1221523,Ud0KXy8YhwO-qz-LzMdYdQ,MhMFi7hae_KsaK8lHcg0iQ,"Came here with a group of 5 in the early evening before the dinner rush. Ordered a bunch of things on the menu including the Hainan chicken and rice, braised beef, salt and pepper shrimp, steamed fish fillet, and wonton soup, as well as various stir fried veggies.

The food is good for the value, there is no doubt. The least impressive item was the braised beef, which featured small pieces of beef drowning in bland beef sludge. 

The service is some of the worst I have seen, and I am no stranger to the curt, no nonsense style that is typical to Chinese restaurants. The lady who was working the counter and taking orders was just plain mean. I saw her yell at a group of customers for wanting to sit at a different table...she literally glared at them for a minute and then finally brought them their menus. We wanted to order more food halfway through the meal. After failing to get her attention we went up to the counter, and were told that our order would be placed at the very end of the queue in this crowded restaurant. Fine! No more food! So we asked for more rice, which was brought over in a huff and slammed on our table. Kind of made for a tense dining experience, if you ask me.

Might be worth it if you love hole-in-the-wall joints like this and have thick skin to boot!",3
1221524,hJXMRajtTr-gFPqWo4ilfQ,MhMFi7hae_KsaK8lHcg0iQ,"It's an average four star due to price and quality of food based on the multiple times I've been here but the most recent time I went there (day after Christmas), makes it a 3.

Not sure why such a popular restaurant would not get extra staff during the holidays but there were only two people doing the cash register, bussing the tables, and serving food in a restaurant that was completely packed and with a line waiting at the door. 

The woman who normally is the only person in there started getting frustrated and had a sullen mood as people began to complain. 

Good food for cheap but I would never go during the holidays. 

While I doubt my complaints on their service will not matter as people will still go here for cheap, delicious food-- to me, they would be earning more money if they could serve people faster and get them out the door with 1 or 2 more waiters.",3

Not too bad for a large portion of orange chicken with plain chow mein and fried rice. The food was good, but I wouldn't get the fried rice again. It was bland and dry. Also got a Thai Ice Tea with boba. The boba had a great consistency just the right amount of chewiness :) will be back for sure.",4

1224088,zscEMWnkciQQc1122kpcpQ,1PQNIw4DgWTy_18cH5hVCA,I ordered Chicken Lo Mein and it was quite tasty though a little on the greasy side. It was sort of expensive for how much food I received. I know there are cheaper Chinese places nearby so I probably won't be swinging in again.,3
1224089,lxE9hMTPysXoC5J3ByUTng,1PQNIw4DgWTy_18cH5hVCA,"Heard about this place when I got a sheet of coupons in the mail. Checked out the menu on the back and found out their lunch specials are valid til 4PM- I'm in! I called in my order on my way out the door from work, and swung by to pick up on my way home. Was told it'd be ready in 10 minutes, was packed and waiting for me when I walked in the door.

Got home and it was still piping hot, always a good sign.
Went for the won ton soup and the combination kung pao lunch special with half-and-half side of chow mein and fried rice. Bummed that the egg drop soup isn't included in take out lunch specials, but I had the giant soup instead. Used a coupon for a free 2 piece of egg rolls or rangoon (picked the rangoon) with $10 minimum purchase. Side note- they didn't take the coupon! I may use it again...

Overall, I was satisfied with the food. The soup in particular was good and despite sitting around for a while, the won tons were not falling apart- a couple, but not enough to make a sweeping statement or a negative impact on the dish. Lots of variety in the soup: bits of bbq pork, shrimp, and veggies in the broth, and plenty of won tons. Would get this again. Initially thought the $6.50 price tag was steep, but it's a meal.
The lunch special was also $6.50, and a hefty portion, too. Compartments of the styrofoam takeout box were overflowing- fried rice was moist but a little boring, chow mein was chewy and a little plain, both both balanced out the crazy combination kung pao. I say crazy here in a good way though- it was a giant portion with every meat mixed in, and quite a bit of chopped veggies, too. Spicy but not enough to scare anyone off, flavorful would be a more accurate way to put it. I did pick out the chiles before I started eating, but was really surprised to see five in my portion. FIVE! So if you're down for spice, go ahead and leave those in.
The rangoons were a nice little treat, small but indulgent, not too much cream cheese, either.

It's so convenient, and the coupons are a nice touch, and the well-priced lunch specials in giant portions (this is easily lunch for tomorrow, too)? I can safely say I'll be back.",4

The chicken fired rice was on the crunchy side as though the rice didn't cook well.

That was back in 2009, and over time the quality has seemed to suffer a bit. The last few times I have ordered anything, the food has tasted weird or no taste at all, and the customer service has been dismissive. Almost as if they don't need customers. I generally order chow fun or green beans in black bean sauce and white rice. White rice has always been included when I ordered either one of these. I ended up taking a few bites of my food and just going to panda express after. Sad, but I will probably never be back to China One.

I also saw the delivery gentleman taking orders out the food for delivery. My son got Beef & Broccoli, which he said was really good. The beef was tendered & food was well seasoned. The hot & sour soup was good too! I hadn't been to any places that put shrimp in hot & sour soup so it is great! Kung Pao Shrimp & strawberry slurpee with boba were good also.

The dumplings were super greasy and not flavorful at all. And my lunch special general tsos chicken tasted off. They gave me an extra mango smoothie as an apology which would have been nice if it didn't taste gross. They told me to order from a different location next time because they are less busy, but that location had terrible reviews compared to this one.

I understand that it's a small business and all so... The hostess and girls who get your refills were pleasant, The food was actually very good tasting. The carpets were still pretty filthy along with the very uncomfortable booths and somewhat dirty walls next to the booths (food splatter and such) My biggest complaint with this place are the bathrooms. Holly crap are they dirty! I understand that the gangster type people carve up the counters and mirrors so this isn't the places fault however the filthy bathrooms really need to be cleaned with a pressure washer and industrial chemicals. As a guy I can stand at the urinal however I would NEVER sit on a toilet at this place! Overall this place needs a very thorough cleaning. They did install a new flat screen TV but no more traditional Chinese music. I'll return to eat however I will be cautious of my surroundings. For me it's convenient as it's not to far away and the $6.45 price isn't bad. (the drink is extra)  If the Dragon Buffet reads these reviews then please try and clean the place up just a bit.

Wontons:  Awesome!
Cheese Ragoons:  Pretty good.
Egg Rolls:  Not a fan and one more try.
Cashew Chicken: Great!
Sesame Chicken:  Not good when you took a bite you could really taste the flour and you could feel the flour texture in your mouth.  Wont get it again 
Rice:  Great.

2.  Order Family Deal B:
Egg Drop Soup:  Mike thought it was good... I am not much of a fan of any kind so I reserve judgement.
Egg Rolls:  2 nd time no good
Wontons:  Awesome
Ragoons:  Great
Cashew Chicken:  Great
Sweet & Sour Chicken:  Awesome! I like the fact they keep the sauce off till after delivery.
Rice:  Good but we were short an order.

3.  Three Entree Order
Wontons:  Free and delicious 
Chow Main:  Seemed a lot like lomein and never thought I would say this but they for sure do not use MSG and you can tell in this dish.  It was just missing a little bit of that butterness that you get with MSG.  But it was OK had worse had better probably wont order again.
Sweet & Sour Chicken:  Awesome our number one dish
Orange Chicken:  Same exact issue we had with the Sesame chicken.  Could really taste that flour and felt the flour texture.

Great food, slow service.  As authentic a Chinese Noodle Place you're going to find outside of the Chinatown on Spring Mountain Road.  If you're not in a hurry, I definitely recommend this place as a reliable spot for delicious and authentic Chinese food, especially the noodle dishes popular in northern China.",4

pork mushroom noodle - was very good.  the in house noodle was thick, you might say
it was fat.  there was at least two types of mushrooms, button and straw, along with tree or maybe black fungus.  pre scrambled egg was mixed in.  this was one of those servings where you had to take a nap afterwards.  i was the first one in. great service but i can see why it can be an issue.  there was only one waitress and the place was starting to fill up.",4

The food was good but could have had a little bit more eggplant.  The service was not friendly meaning I didn't get a smile at any point or a thank you in fact the girl put my bag on the counter and walked away.  The waitress was also not hygienic I observed her playing with her hair while taking an order and exposing her hairy armpits. My food was tasty but poor service is not part of my dining pleasure.,2

The potstickers were good, flavorful filling and came out nice and crispy, at $4.95, it's a great deal.  In addition, we ordered:

Pork with sliced mushrooms noodles, by far the best dish.  The pork and mushrooms blend in perfectly and absorbs the full flavors along with the noodles.  For just under $7, this is a steal.

The Szechuan Dan Dan Noodle was not as good, but decent.  I was expecting more of a spicy kick but a got a tangy and peanut butter flavor (WTF??).  For under $7, can't complain much.

Szechuan Chicken with Noodles was more of what I was expecting, would recommend to order this.

This place is on the Eastside of Vegas, about 15 to 20 minutes away from the Strip.  Would consider coming here if I'm going to Green Valley Ranch.",4

Now, the cafe offers Vietnamese-Chinese Cuisine, which is nothing different from any other regular Chinese-American food chains and the taste of the food was alright. Sooooo sad!!!

We went again today, and what a disappointment.  The significantly reduced portion of General Tso's tasted mostly of thick sauce (my friend identified it as ketchupy, with burnt breading), the spring roll was bland and oily inside, the rice tasted like mushy nothing.  There were two waiters for an otherwise empty dining room, and we were bugged no fewer than three times about whether everything was okay.  Well, no, it wasn't.

There's a grand opening sign outside, so I take it someone else bought the place.  I really wish they hadn't.  This had been one of our favorite lunch spots, but I doubt we'll be coming here again.",2

Their beef soup was really good. I had to steal the my husbands plate. 

The place itself is very casual and relaxed. There were only two other dinners when we walked in, it was about 2 p.m., we ordered and the food came out about 10 minutes later. We spent about $20 for two meals, three drinks, and two appetizers, not too shabby.",5

This used to be our favorite place for noodles and Chinese but the new owners have turned it into more of a Vietnamese place.  Lots of pho on the new and much smaller menu.

Since I couldn't get my usual dan dan noodles, I had some mapo tofu and the wife had orange chicken.  Like the reviews below state, we felt the flavors are nothing like they used to be.  As Chinese goes, this new place is strictly mediocre at best.

Its a little deceptive to keep the name, logo and decor the same when you have new owners and a completey new menu and that is, perhaps, the biggest disappointment.",2

Anyway, I made a call for pick up the other day and was confused when the girl on the line kept telling me that they didn't have my beloved schezuan eggpant noodles, or my pork wontons in red chile sauce....I thought maybe they had run out?  I end up ordering some egg fu yung and beef & broccoli noodles (I've had both before from here.  Delicious.) 

I pull up to the restaurant and walk up to the door, to find a new paper menu taped to the door!  I was beyond shocked because the restaurant bares the same name, signage and made no mention as to their new ownership when I was trying to order my ""the usual"".   

I walk in to an empty restaurant and ask the girl about the ownership.   She told me they have new owners and a new menu.  I leave feeling pretty bummed, but willing to give it a try, because I can't walk out and I'm hungry.  

I drive home (15-20) and pull out my dishes....gross.  The egg fu yung's brown sauce was filled, literally to the brim of the styrofoam packaging.  The gravy was broken and had about an inch of oil on the top of it.  I took out a patty and took a bite, LAVA hot.  The noodles for the beef and broccoli weren't fresh at all and adding a traditional beef and broccoli (from PANDA EXPRESS) over some boxed noodles, was not what I am looking for at all.  That dish was also greasy and unappealing.  

Total nightmare.",1
1244455,ThOGW8bzUfS6CTnq4ZU9FQ,jlFhZFGzROkhhSIfXM1oJQ,"This is by far one of best bao places that I have ever been too in my life. I still think about eating the pork belly bao when i'm back in LA. I really wish that they had something like this in my area. This joint is definitely one of the hidden gems in Las Vegas. When you take the first bite of the pork belly you'll first taste the crispiness of skin and when you get to the center, the belly just slowly melts in your mouth. The pork belly is cooked perfectly, not overly cooked or too crispy. It doesn't taste fattening like other places where they would keep a big chunk of fat to just get rid of it. This place is different, it really doesn't have that fatty taste to it. And the chef makes sure to utilize that part of the belly so that it brings out all the favors of the dish. It is so good. I still miss it. I tried the duck, belly, and the asian noodles, ice coffee and the tea. The asian sesame noodles was so good too. It has this tropical kick to it. Mmm.... The noodles tasted so fresh and the sauce I really don't know how they made it, but it was good. I highly recommend this place it. If you are tired of eating out at buffets, definitely checkout this place out. I've been to about 5 buffets here and yet I can say, this place left a lasting impression.  Everything that I ate and drank here was really top of the notch. Now that I'm back in LA I wish ate more of it.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. Pork Belly Bao: ENGROSSED* (5+/5)",5
1248951,4oU7JG0WQL2UrlE01KGnMQ,RQ_QaWi1Cc4X6odfGuUGcA,"Another one of those places that so close too the house always pass by too and from work. Always wondered about the food and finally got around too trying me some. I went for lunch in general fan of asian lunch specials. At Long Jin they have really nice one whole page selection of ones too choose from! It mostly your standard ones from the sweet and sour, kung pao, mongolian beef, etc. They do have the regular menu too choose from also but on this day went with the lunch special. Really for under ten dollars get pic k of entree, comes with choice of hot and sour soup or another one forget, fried egg roll, and favorite munchies fried noodle looking sticks dip in sweet and sour sauce before get your soup. I went with the lo mein noodles with chicken. Choice of soup went with the Hot and Sour soup. Also ordered on of the appetizers just too taste more of the menu. I tried the salt and pepper calamari. 

The Hot and Sour soup. Fan!!!! I really liked the depth of the flavor, hearty with lots of mushrooms, and whatever else they put in it. It great way too start meal with nice cup of HOT soup. The salt and calamari this I lOved. Too be fair anything done salt and pepper style (no matter the protein) destroy. The seasoning was well done had nice little kick too it. Best part of it was nice chunks of calamari rather then  ring style that can easily get overcooked and dried out. The breaded was perfect,  It had nice golden brown color, crispy, calamari moist on the inside cooked perfect, and addicting appetizer. The entree this is were felt like just OK nothing really amazed me or wanted me too have seconds. The noodles were cooked spot on, as were the vegetables, and chicken. Just felt that lack identity came too flavor in the dish. I felt like eating plain noodles with saute chicken and vegetables. I understand base of the dish but still could put something in it give it life. 

The service was awesome. I never had empty glass although since only one in the restaurant might not be best gage of the service. Still being the only one in for lunch they were very attentive too service. One thing that found odd was had no music going in the restaurant and since only one in for lunch felt awkward being so quite here pin drop. They do have couple televisions in the restaurants but neither of them was on. I like the decor inside it has nice relax vibe. 

Even though feel like just ok. The location being close too home place that would come back too try more of the lunch specials and more salt and pepper action...",3
1248952,3dO4TyTKX-eP1GyO090FxQ,RQ_QaWi1Cc4X6odfGuUGcA,"I'm not sure if it was the holiday or what, but it was empty and quiet here. And I liked it.

Long Jin sits in one of those corner plazas with not all that much going on. There's a Mexican joint that I'll probably try soon, there's some sort of casino, and I really didn't notice anything else of importance. I mainly decided to try it because it was nearby so I wouldn't have to spend extra time getting to and back from the Spring Mountain area.

I ordered the beef lo mein ($7.99) from the lunch special menu, which is all pretty typical Chinese restaurant fare. The lunch special includes a veggie egg roll, crispy noodles with a sweet red sauce, and a soup choice of egg flower (my choice) or hot and sour. They were all good, not uniquely great.

The lo mein was a little underseasoned so I ended up throwing some soy sauce on it, and it might be a little too oily for some people, but I didn't mind. The beef was quite tender, which I suppose is expected, again, out of typical Chinese food. I liked the sliced onions but wished that they had diced up the green onions for even portioning.

Overall, I felt pretty satisfied and not hungry yet not overly full. They do delivery within 3 miles for $2 if you're that close and are too busy/lazy to head out here. I would recommend this as a local option, not as a place to go out of your way to visit.",4
1248953,6DuF8oZFE4w8AqeZJnGfTQ,RQ_QaWi1Cc4X6odfGuUGcA,"Okay, it's probably too soon to write a rave review about this place but we just ordered from here this weekend and it was really good. Best mongolian beef I've had outside of PF Changs. Just the right amount of spicy, scallions, onions and really, really tasty. Fried rice is pretty good, although I don't understand why they (chinese restaurants) all insist on using frozen peas and carrots. They just aren't good people! Other good items included Roasted duck, house lo mein, salt & pepper calamari (probably better right out of the fryer) and... the coups de gras... Nutella & Banana dessert Eggrolls? Yep, you just read that right. And they were more delicious than you could every imagine! Definitely be ordering again. It was a little pricey and delivery took a lot longer than she estimated, and won ton soup was mediocre... so thus the four not five star review.",4

We took home the lo mien, which had good flavor. I also got the tangerine beef. I liked this very much. The beef was crispy, tangy and sweet. MY DH enjoyed the honey walnut shrimp. 
Did not really care for the fried rice. Too many green onions.
That will not stop us from coming back. We enjoyed our meal. Next time we will dine in.",4
1248959,cOo3l5D3_cq2iqRW2rbWPg,RQ_QaWi1Cc4X6odfGuUGcA,"First off, this is probably one of the cleanest Asian restaurants I've been to and I've been to quite ALOT since I'm from San Francisco.

Before we ordered, we were greeted and asked if we wanted to start off with any drinks so we all went for a cup of iced water. When it arrived, it was MUCH cleaner than the typical Vegas tap water that 95% of the restaurants in Vegas served. When I asked why this way, the owner, Lily, told me that it's because they used advanced filters that also had UV bacteria killers.

Lily continued to tell me about a new energy drink they started serving pretty recently with the brand ""XS"". She brought out an information sheet for me that compared XS to Red Bull, Monster, and many other energy drinks. XS was much lower in calories, sugar, sodium and calories. I decided to try the pink grapefruit which was amazing and woke me up instantly. Caffeine usually has very little effects on me so I prefer only the strongest coffee I can find but learning about how XS can be healthier because they are extremely high in Vitamin B made me take a look at healthier options.

Onto the food, we ordered the sweet and sour pork, the beef lo mein, rice, seafood soup, honey glazed shrimp and walnuts, beef and eggplants, and fried cream cheese dumplings. The food there was definitely fresh and of good quality which made it extremely tasty. The fried cream cheese dumplings were very crispy and the cream cheese added just the right amount of balance to the dish. The beef from the lo mein was very tender and the eggplants were slightly crunchy on the outer layer. The soup was slightly spicy and tasted great!

I'd definitely come back here for an early lunch the next time I go to Vegas! There were tons of parking spots and although it may be a 5-10 minute drive from the strip, it was nice to be in a part of Vegas that was a bit more peaceful.",5
1248960,MDCn0uuhQWk5mHglhOhAJQ,RQ_QaWi1Cc4X6odfGuUGcA,"Long Jin is one of our go-to spots for weeknight Chinese, and one item in particular. The half Peking Duck. The crunchy mandarin beef is a little on the sweet side, but indulgent and wonderful, and pretty much everything else I've tried has been great. My husband's never failed to eat all of his food and then try to steal some of mine. 

But oh, that duck. Fluffy pancakes, crisp scallions, sweet duck...delivered. For less than $30. Sold! 

We've eaten in store a few times and always had a great experience here. It's clearly a family run joint; often there's an adorable little girl running around. (On one visit she kept trying to quietly change the TV to cartoons and getting in trouble, but it was super cute.) And I'm pretty sure the staff is often the lady out front, and someone in back. 2 people, running a whole restaurant, with food and prices this good. Often the dining room is pretty empty, I think they do a lot of takeout business, but it is still a very clean, relaxing dining room that makes you feel comfortable.

Takeout's usually ready in 10-15 minutes, hot, steamy, and so good. They also offer delivery, but they use a delivery service (who I am not rating in this review, or deducting them points for) that can be kind of spacey. They lost our food twice. So now we just do takeout.",4

We were the only ones in the restaurant and ordered the following 5 dishes for lunch:  beef chow fun, sweet & sour pork, crispy sole filet, HK chow mein with chicken, and chicken with mushroom.  The only thing that tasted good was the beef chow fun.  The s/s pork was okay;  and fish didn't taste to fresh, dry but was still edible.  The two chicken plates had a funny taste to it, kind of sour maybe used old chicken.

The guy that took the order also cooked the food.  It took a while to cook the food.  But after taking our order and bringing in our food, no one asked how our food was or asked us if we wanted anymore water.  Considering we were the only ones here, I though the service would have been better since it seemed like it was a family run restaurant.

1251824,ymxX80gx4LF1lH0kiRhPVA,fAJYeE4Q6vwVPGkk1MWCoQ,"Not exaggerating...this was the worst Chinese food I've had. Anywhere. Ever. 

A coworker recommended China Tango a few weeks ago and said it was her favorite Chinese place so I decided to give it a try. I walked in and ordered 1) Hot and Spicy Shrimp, and 2) Beef and Broccoli. The hostess was really nice, polite, and said my food would be ready in 20 minutes. 

20 minutes later, I was back. My food was ready to go so I paid (thinking it was a little on the pricey side for a non-fancy Chinese place, but figured the food would be worth it based on the recommendation) and was off on my way home. Problem number one, the way they packed the food: two containers of rice on the bottom, hot and spicy shrimp (in a styrofoam container) in the middle, and the beef (in plastic Tupperware container) on top. I made a right turn and the dishes on top toppled over and the shrimp sauce spilled right out (into the plastic bag but still...a mess. And now my car smelled like ketchup. More on that later.). Maybe I should have reorganized the food in the bag Tetris-style but I'm not a huge takeout person so the thought never occurred to me. But it should occur to the people at China Tango, no??? Well, it didn't.

Then the food. So bad. So bad. So bad. 

Beef and broccoli: the beef was rubbery and fatty. Seriously yucky. The sauce was completely bland. The broccoli and carrots were fresh and crunchy but I didn't pay $15 for broccoli and carrots! 

Hot and Spicy Shrimp: shrimp was breaded then tossed with onions and like a whole bottle of ketchup.  Maybe two. Even my daughter asked, ""why does the house smell like ketchup?"" when I opened up the container.  This was quite possibly the worst dish I've ever had. Setting aside the ketchup for a second, why would you bread shrimp only to mix it in a thick sauce? It ends up being soggy. Seriously, all around gross. 

Unless you've got a thing for ketchup, I'd suggest staying far away from China Tango.",1

I told him to go ahead and eat so his food wouldn't get cold. After 10 minutes I ask where my dinner was he said one minute and went to answer the phone. Meanwhile a whole family of 4 was served their meal while I continued to wait. My husband was finished eating by this time. So I ask for a to go box for his food. Then he brings out my food. I told him I didn't want it now we were leaving. He charged me for food I didn't get. He never apologized or anything! I will NEVER EVER GO BACK! I do not recommend this place at all. Bad service!!,1

No flaming & tasted like shrimp with onion relish over it. I asked them why this is & they laughed & made some excuse but never offered to replace the dish. The ambiance is a 5 but don't be fooled. The food is what matters.,1

I haven't tried any of their non-lunch specials. It's one of the few places where you get hot and sour soup or egg flower soup when you pick it up or get it delivered so an extra star for that. Most Asian places don't include soup unless you dine in. It's a little better and cheaper than Panda Express but you get a bigger portion and soup. It's not the best nor the worst Chinese food I've had but definitely hits the spot when you want Chinese food.

I haven't dined here but the service is decent. A few times, I had to wait a few minutes when they said it would be ready in 10 minutes but not a deal breaker.",3

Anyways, the place was not busy. I placed an order for pancit and Mongolian beef... It took forever!!! 35 mins was unnecessary. Would I come back? No. This was my first visit.

Pancit was less than ok. It lacks flavor and veggies.
The Mongolian beef was the worst we've ever had, anywhere. The taste was very off... The texture was extremely rubbery. All I could taste was the loaded sauce, which btw, spilled in the bag. I've had this dish at different places, made different at each location. This ranks last place.
Both were overpriced. We had plenty left over and went to garbage.",1

Girl was behind the counter with her feet up texting. She acknowledged me. I had to get up after that and get my own menu. Lazy girl. Placed my order at the counter to speed things up. She seemed inconvenienced by me. She put the order in. I heard the cook in the back making my order. He kept sneezing. Freaked me out.",1

If you like boba don't come right at opening, its not ready yet. that's the reason for 4 stars.

the combination kung pao is too spicy for me...the spiciest i've ever had. they put the regular crushed red pepper and the long red peppers, but also add jalapeno. next time i will order no jalapeno .

the lunch with large Thai tea was under 10 bux and more than enough for lunch and dinner.",4

She wanted Mexican, so I started looking for a Chinese place nearby. China A Go Go had good Yelp reviews, so I called in my order from the Mexican place she got her food. 

My order of Sesame Chicken was ready in about 10 minutes, it was waiting for me when I got there. The portions were pretty large and the chicken was cooked perfectly, not too crunchy and tasted excellent.

The fried rice was an extra $2.50, which may be normal, but I don't recall paying that much extra for it before.

At any rate, my experience here was excellent and I would definitely recommend it!",4

I am glad that this venue at Windmill makes up for the others with the hygiene problems. My fingers are crossed that this China a Go Go stay as great as it is!

I came with my husband during his lunch break because I was craving cheap Chinese lunch specials and this location was the closest. We went in and the waitress was kind and told us to sit down anywhere. I was quite impressed that they had booths and looked like a cute little restaurant since most other china a go go's look like only take out locations. There was only one other table but within, no joke, about 10 minutes, the place got packed!
They bring you crispy wontons with sweet and sour sauce, and egg drop soup (only for dine in) as you wait for drinks. I ordered the Mongolian beef lunch special for about $6, expecting something small and greasy, assuming you get what you paid for.
It comes out in to go boxes and that box was FILLED! My husband and I looked at each other in shock at how much food they give. We could already tell that we weren't gonna be able to finish it. It comes with both chow mein and fried rice and the food was piping hot/fresh.
I love Chinese food and I grew up eating authentic Chinese food so if you're looking for that, this place isn't it. But if you're looking for really decent quality Chinese food for dirt cheap, then this is definitely the place to go (especially this location, really clean).",4

When I moved here in November I was curious if I could find a Chinese food place that I loved as much as I did back in California. I am not big on a lot of Chinese food but I love chicken fried rice. This is usually how I rate a good Chinese place. I am a picky eater so I have always ordered mine with no vegetables, rice, chicken, and egg only.
China A Go Go is on my way home from work so I thought I would give them a try. I ordered on-line with the special instructions of no veggies and a pick up time of ASAP as I was leaving work in 5 minute and it is about a 5 minute drive away. I was leery of the online ordering but it worked just fine. I arrived at the place and my order was ready and best of all it was correct, No Veggies!!
The best part of all is it tasted exactly like the chicken fried rice I use to get at my favorite place in California. I am a fan of this place and I see a lot more orders in the future. The price was also reasonable.",5

In the end I put my trust in Yelp and I got my food 30 mins after I ordered and paid online! It sucks that you have to pay for delivery but at least it's only $2. I also got a beef entry and when I was paying for it, I was concerned because I thought it was kinda expensive, but when it got here, the amount you get is reasonable.

This place was terrible! My orange chicken was the worst i have ever had and that's a lot of orange chicken it's one of my favs! When it came it was all clumped and sticking together as if it were one big glob...there was no taste, very bland and no crispyness what so ever.

Although the staff were friendly, the food was not as good as some other Chinese restaurants I've experienced in this town. 

I ordered egg rolls and the mongolian beef lunch special. First - the spring rolls. Now when I envision a delicious spring roll I see a delicate wrapper with shredded goodness on the inside. Light, flavorful. These were the opposite. The wrapper was SO thick, it felt like I was chewing on two of them, not just one. And the ""shredded veggies"" on the inside, were not shredded. They were chopped up and extremely thick, the veggies were hard as well, as though they hadn't been cooked well. It was too much to chew. The ""spicy mustard"" they gave to me was in a packet and was not hot AT ALL. It was like regular mustard. Yuck. 

The mongolian beef was good but again, the slices of beef were enormous! They were not bite sized. They were double and triple bite sized. Definitely do NOT order this on a date because you will look like a velociraptor tearing into his meal. There was a lot of flavor, but also - a LOT of grease. The fried rice that went along with the meal was dry and tasteless. I only ate a couple of bites.

So overall, if you're looking for a quick meal with big portions and friendly staff - you've got it. If you're looking for refined taste and normal portions - you might want to try elsewhere. Sometimes, and this is one of those times, bigger isn't always better.",3

I've eaten at Da Sheng's dozens of times over the years. It's not always the same. Sometimes the food is excellent sometimes not so good no matter what you order. Same with the service. That's my biggest gripe. Since it's in the middle of the mall with gift stores all around I think they assume you are a tourist and treat you as such. for us locals If they know you, you get better service. Once I was there and the waiter was close to being very rude, and just rushed me to order and seemed like he wanted me out of there in a hurry, the place was empty that day as it was late. A friend of mine, one of the shop owners, happened to walk by and wave and did a traditional bow as he passed by. all of a sudden my waiter did a 180 and treated me like a king. As far as the food I think it's who the cook is on any given day. I've had the same dish taste like wet cardboard or the best thing you ever ate. I generally take home the leftovers and the second day seems always better after it's marinated in my fridge. I've also gotten beef when I ordered lamb. They have a big lunch crowd and lunch specials. I think that tires out the help too, so if you go late in the afternoon you will certainly know the difference. Price wise it's very reasonable and also good for large crowds and banquets. It's a big place.and I would recommend it for that purpose for sure. I gave it 4 stars because more often than not I have a good meal and good service, and the examples I mentioned above are the exception. Bear in mind it's not gourmet nor is it intended to be. many of the people who work in the mall eat there for convenience and business is generally steady. As I said it's a big place s it looks empty much of the time, don't let that throw you off for trying it.",4

Went to China town and I remember walking through the china town mall and seeing this restaurant in the middle, in the past. I'm sad I didn't get a chance to try it til now cause it's so delicious! We ordered seafood fried rice, pig ears, salt and pepper shrimp and a whole fish fried with chili sauce. EVERYTHING we ordered came out perfectly satisfying for our taste bud. I would defiantly recommend the fried fish with the chili sauce because its prob the best fried fish with such a flavorful sauce. I really enjoy trying new things and the pig ear was cooked very well, once again it was extremely flavorful. All four dishes for under $44 after tax!",5
1281926,Ts7yOaQ7h6i04scAln567w,07kcENxFQxwVWYiZ5fqlOg,"I gave this place one star, but I really meant zero. They charged higher prices than what was on the menu and when we brought it to their attention, they denied it, saying they had a ""special price"". The food itself was oily and salty, and the boba was gross. It was hard and you could tell at least a couple of days old. Service was very rude and unresponsive, and we weren't able to tip less than their forced 15% that they printed on the receipt. Overall, a lot of lies on their promotions and menu, and food was less than mediocre.",1
1281927,_xXl4hw1bu4pZD9Iwn7Vyg,07kcENxFQxwVWYiZ5fqlOg,"Food taste pretty good.
The rice cake was not that authentic (not Shanghainese flavor)
The crispy chicken is not good (it's like soaked in soy sauce lol)

But the beef noodle is amazing!

Drinks buy one get one free (forgot to check the prize for one)
The spicy fish is good.


We ordered 5 dishes and 5 drinks for $72.

One star off for being a bit pricey.
Overall: nice!",3

BUT!! the food is not tasty at all, not to say its ""real traditional Hunan style"". we ordered three dishes but we didnot finish 1/4(we both were starving).Never come again.",1
1293026,hRuMORLWUa8d87TxHYoRVg,VK7XhT6wv-mWV6N1IU4xXA,"I grew up in Hunan,  the food taste just like what I had at home. If you want the most authentic,spicy, Hunan style food, this is place. If you have never been to China or Hunan, then don't bother to waste your time here, they won't have what you looking for. They usually have a lot bones in the meat, waitress there normally do not speak much English( they won't be waitress otherwise!) The waiting time was not too bad, you know compare to Cheese cake factory, also good Chinese food probably takes much time to prepare!!",5
1293027,TajUxvaH47jlcXfIDFx1pQ,VK7XhT6wv-mWV6N1IU4xXA,"HOLY MOLY QUACAMOLE! If you want authentic and spicy Chinese food.. this is the place to be! It is as authentic as you can get.. and how do I know? Well.. my, not-blood sister is full Chinese and she took me here! 

I have to say.. spicy food is not really my thing, but it was pretty good! The service was amazing and the place is so clean. They have a huge television where they play Chinese music all day. The seating is usually typical-- family style where they have the rotating tables in the middle and they also have small seatings for small parties.

Food:

Cucumbers- The cucumbers were fresh and helped me keep my mouth cool when eating the spicy food!

Shredded Potatoes- Yummy! The potatoes were thinly sliced and dipped in a somewhat vinegar sauce.. it was so good and one of my favorite dishes on the menu!

Mapo Tofu- It comes in a bowl filled with tofu cubes and red spicy sauce that is so flavorful!

Pork belly with vegetables- Not one of my favorite dishes.. the pork belly was tough and the veggies weren't as good.

Whole fish- THE STAR OF THE NIGHT! It was delicious but SUPER SPICY! They put a specific type of pepper on the fish and they cook it whole with a sauce on the bottom.. although it was super spicy, I couldn't stop eating it! The fish is so soft that it melts in your mouth! Word on the street was that if you flip over the fish, it causes bad luck-- so make sure you eat the fish they way it is presented to you!

I would probably not go back here unless I am with someone who speaks Chinese. It is delicious, but no one understood any English and language barrier is just hard. I wouldn't want to order anything TOO spicy for me to handle... or my toilet!",4
1293028,RQzER5AD-uGvHhy0emCRrw,VK7XhT6wv-mWV6N1IU4xXA,"My family is from Hunan so I was feeling a little homesick and missed my Granma's cooking. I brought people who don't really eat spicy food so the flavor will not be in it's truest form. In China we have 4 main regional cuisines, ""Xiang"" is from the Hunan province. It's often confused with Sichuan cuisine which features a different style of peppers and form of spiciness. ""Xiang"" cuisine is spicy, fragrant pepper, hot-peppery, fresh taste with sour spicy taste, it is an immediate reaction to flavors. The spiciness practically combusts on your taste buds. Essentially speaking if you're planning to eat this, you're going to sweat!!! The only authentic dish I ordered was the Duo jiao pepper fish head, the server insisted on whole fish so it's duo jiao pepper whole fish. It's steamed and the flavors is something you can't find anywhere else. Order this dish and you will have a decent understanding in Xiang cuisine. My friends ordered the Mapo tofu which is of Sichuan cuisine so that was just mediocre. We ordered a pork and pepper dish but the spiciness level was toned down to nothing so the flavors were missing. Finally, the thinly sliced vinegar stir fry potato was pretty epic. What I would recommend is if you can't handle spicy make sure you advise the staff but they will tone it down to where you won't really grasp all the flavors the cuisine has to offer. The venue is nothing fancy, it's simple, there is a flat screen that plays KTV videos. Did I mention peppers speeds up your metabolism? Another great reason to try this style of cuisine.",4

If you like spicy - this is the place for AUTHENTIC Hunan food!

The owner lady try to over charge me for each dish, and when I pointed it out, she tried to play dumb like she didn't know. I've googled this restaurant online, other customers had same experiences with overcharging from this restaurant. So, ""buyer beware""! Just watch your bill and check every item's price if you go. I'd go to other restaurants next time, there are so many other choices in that area.",1

I've tried their cumin lamb (excellent) and young chow fried rice (good although I wish it included another type of meat in addition to the shrimp, such as pork).  I would recommend trying some of the authentic Chinese dishes and asking the waitress or owner for recommendations.  They have lots of spicy dishes on the menu and some non-spicy as well.",5

My roommates and I placed a delivery order for lunch. We each ordered a lunch special since they ranged from $5-6 which included your selected entree with egg drop soup, egg roll, and steam/fried rice. We chose the General Tso's Chicken, Moo Goo Gai Pan, Sweet and Sour Chicken, Beef w/broccoli, and an Orange Chicken. We also added a 3 Thai Tea Boba's and our total came to $41, not bad! 

I can't speak for my roommates food, but considering they ate it all, I'd say they seemed to like it just fine.

As for me, I had the Moo Goo Gai Pan, and it was cooked just the way I liked it! I prefer my vegetables to be on the crunchy side and that's exactly how they were prepared. The sauce was light but still flavorful and the  chicken was tender. 

The egg rolls were also pretty great. Not greasy at all and packed with crunchy veggies! Soup and fried rice were good, nothing to rave about, but met my expectations and were satisfying. 

The Thai Tea was also to my liking. Not overly sweet, and the boba was just right (not too hard or soggy). 

We ordered delivery and they said it would be 45-50 mins. They arrived right on time and the food was nice and hot. 

Lastly, I'd like to point out that their portions were pretty generous considering it was a lunch special! Two huge helpings of rice with a good size entree. 

Cheap, tasty and filling, everything I look for in a local Chinese restaurant! Definitely a good option for the Eastsiders that don't feel like making the trip to Chinatown. I'll be calling them again for my next Chinese food craving :)",5

I've ordered delivery from them a few times with the eat24 app. The restaurant is super awesome because on the app, depending on what, or how much you order, the restaurant gives you a choice of free items. I spent $30 and I could pick from four or five different things. I LOVE CHOICES! The food came pretty quickly and it was all soooooo hot! That NEVER happens with delivery. Another thing that was awesome, was the pork in my lo mein was moist n juicy! Portions are huge and prices are great. Their cream cheese wontons are more addictive than crack and half the price!
Good on you, china roll!",4

I opened up one of the shrimp and it looked like shrimp jerky. It was horrible.  I won't be back,2

Especially cause they are very inexpensive. But me and my fiancé weren't wanting to leave the house so hell why not. We ordered the 40 pieces for $30. Super inexpensive and a lot of sushi can't go wrong. Let me tell you I have ordered from much more expensive places spending nearly $100 on sushi and they weren't as good as China Roll!! They were amazing!!! Portioning was great! I was amazed how good it was. We even sent a text to our friend as we were eating who is ordering as we speak!!! This place will definitely be getting our business more often. They delivery guy was super nice and they got here super fast. They quoted me an hour but was here in 30 minutes!!!

Orange chicken is delescious. Best thing we probably had was the new York style chow mein. It was awesome, fresh crunchy vegtables. Added bonus if you use the eat 24 ap and order through it you get a free appatizer to choose from. Egg rolls are good, nice and crunchy and not oily. Overall a good bang for your.buck here",5

I wish I got 2, or a lifetime supply. And the food as well! Got free egg rolls, I'm usually not a fan of them but these were actually pretty good. The cream cheese wontons are the best I've had anywhere so far. And the orange chicken was good also! Delivery was fast also I will definitely order again.",5

The waitress was nice and kind, but she didn't understand anything that we were saying.

The food smelled off and was unbelievably greasy, you have no idea. I wish I took photos, but I couldn't because I didn't want a picture of that disgusting pile of slop on my phone.

In fact, my tummy was not feeling great while I was eating my lunch. therfore I didn't finish my food then. Both my son and I got stomach ache. I almost vomit in front of my car and try to stay positive about it (thinking can not be from this restaurant) but after 7 hours, I must said got to be some fish filled or shrimp that I ate, they may not be fresh.

1299706,7LC1yAzym5yjoMLLTLWAqA,JGEJCYz7gbnOtxbgXB-zSg,"Went here two Saturday nights ago. Very busy but that is what drew us in. We had planned on dining at the center across the street, however, due to lack of parking we crossed the street to the center where Hong Kong Garden was. We drove by and saw almost every table was filled and with Asian people (good sign for a Asian restaurant). So we dined here. 

I would probably give it four and a half . The service was abrupt. Which didn't bother me but they were all business. Very matter of fact, quick service quick food but not rude just felt busy.  But they offered us free soup, we didn't have it because we ordered fish maw but it was still nice they offered and we were provided with some free dessert. I still don't know what the dessert was, it was a yellow sweet broth with what seemed to be a chicken base and maybe some sort of root vegetable in it. 

They seemed very authentic as to what the menu offered. Many dishes such as duck tongue etc. We had the eggplant hot pot, the beef was a little too fatty for me but hubby loved it. I guess fat = flavor, however, I still would have preferred it a little leaner. The eggplant was good too, and there was not thick sweet cornstarch coating as in most fast food Chinese places.  Also, we had the BBQ half duck - yum! and a great price I believe we paid around $10. About a quarter of it was too bony though with little to no meat, but that is to be expected for duck. The table next to us had giant clam - it looked very impressive. 

The fish maw was bland but the waitress informed us it is popular, just not our taste.

This restaurants sports a cooked food and bbq area. Variety of cooked foods available to be ordered to-go. 

They had a lack of waitresses this night. As if they didnt expect the sudden rush. I was told they they are pretty busy at late night times, normally so didnt make sense to only have like 2 waitresses run around the entire restaurant. 

Prices were pretty good (late night special). 

First thing first (like every other chinese restaurant), the soup ! omg salty. first sip, ahhh omg its quite salty. like they didnt expect the rush of people, added a bunch of salt and water to increase the size of their soup pot... not good x_x 

1/2 a roast duck - $9.95 - roasted on site, im pretty sure. probably from earlier on the day though. skin was a bit tough to get through, wasnt crispy. we had asked for the sauces to be on the side as well, to keep the skin from soaking it all up but that didnt help the skin either. the smaller drumstick that attaches to the wing, had quite the few hairs/feathers left (picture doesnt really show but if you look at the smaller drumstick in the middle, it was almost covered in the hairs). 

Spicy liver thing - $6.95 - lots of dried red peppers cooked with onions and livers. At first glance, we were like ""wahhh that looks spicy..."" but we were quite disappointed. wasn't spicy at all. (sad face). flavor was pretty good but we wished it was spicy as the name had suggested, i believe. 

Bitter melon & Fish - $6.95 - uhhh not a fan of bitter melon. more bitter than what my mom cooks at home. but either way, still not a fan of bitter melon. fish was the tilapia? filets you can buy at like the asian grocery stores, frozen. 

Chicken w/ taro pot - $6.95 - the chicken, you can tell was a little fried, or cooked prior to being put in the pot with the taro. It was a bit tough/overcooked and dry. The taro was good but there was a little amount. Dish also includes some small pieces of ginger, mushrooms, and chinese sausage. Ok dish but mainly because i like taro. Chicken was eh. 

Overall. Ok experience. Not sure if id come here again. Prices were pretty good during late night specials.",3

The prices are amazingly cheap but the flavors are not and the portions are generous. We ordered the duck & crispy pork (my fav) combo, cold whole chicken (including the head), eggplant, green beans, chow-fun and fried tofu. I ate till I couldn't anymore. Needless to say there was enough for take home. The restaurant was clean and well kept. Great spot for a lunch stop. BTW: they give away free soup at lunch. You won't be disappointed.",4

The only thing I was very disapointed was the Salt and Pepper Pork Chop. When I ate this dish at Hong Kong Garden, there was tons if fat, oil, and starch inside the pork chop that I decided not to eat anymore. Compare to my other favorite chinese restaurant, has more taste, less fat, less oil, less starch, and more crispy. But overall the service and wait time was good.",3
1299711,Lv4WJrgeo2qIW7knd13Igg,JGEJCYz7gbnOtxbgXB-zSg,"Went there for lunch time. I think they didn't like to serve us at all. They jus put the plate on the table and walked away without asking anything ok for u guys or u need anything else. Brought out the drink without the straw . When we asked for that, they jus like ok don't ask anything anymore. Made me so uncomfortable on that day. I will never come back to that anymore.",2

There were few tables still eating, not too busy, But waitress is rude, I'd give no star for service if I could. Food is fairly reasonable price, taste like any other Cantonese that's around. Don't expect any service, I'd suggest order take home.",1

You know how? 
If mom says the rice is good, then that means they know what they are doing here! It's all about the rice. 

What we had on separate occasions:
-Roast Duck and Roast Pork combo plate - I really liked the roast pork because it was basically roasted pork belly, sliced thin with crispy skin. The duck was meaty and tasty, but we did get some pieces that were not meaty. I guess, they all can't be meaty. 
-Green beans and scallops with XO sauce - the flavors were good but I would need to ask for it to be spicier next time. 
-Salt and Pepper Pork - I did not enjoy this because I found that most of the pieces were mainly fat. About 50% meat and 50% fat. 
-Stone Crab porridge - this is not on the menu and you need to talk to the server about their specialties. I think they may have just made this up? It was incredible because I got to eat the yummies in the shell! 

There is also a pre-prepared food counter if you need to pick up Chinese BBQ and food, fast. 

I would definitely come back, for some more roasted pork and crab.",4

The food there taste very good specially the Singapore style noodles and the five spice beef..pretty much what ever you get tastes good...they have a huge menu so many different things to try...but when i go there i always see Chinese people ordering way different stuff from what we order only if i can figure out what they eat lol...,5

The soup of the day was tasty.  

Clams with green onions and ginger was thickly sauced.  I can still feel the sandy grit in my teeth.  The green onions were the best part of the dish.  

Fried tofu stuffed with shrimp needed more flavor.  Good thing it came with sauce.  

Roast pork was thinly sliced and could have used more flavor. It was sliced thicker than paper but we could have used more pork.  I don't even think the meat weighed more than a quarter pound.  

Yee fu noodles were so so. 

They had the largest and heaviest water glasses ever. The place was packed with Chinese peeps.  Those peeps have different taste standards.  

Bottom line = needs more flavor.",2

We were a large party so we were given a private room. I could not understand a word our server was saying! We just kept repeating what we were saying which was getting kind of confusing! 

The staff was nice though. We had a birthday cake with us and they gave us birthday candles to put on em! They accommodated our needs when they were needed.

Came in around midnight, ordered the seafood pan fried noodle and spring roll app.
Spring rolls were unremarkable- exterior freshly fried, interior mushy as if they'd been frozen, no bueno. The pan fried noodle was an enormous portion with ample seafood (two different kinds of squid, fish, scallops, and possibly clams?) and veggies (Chinese broccoli and carrots), and a portion of noodles so large we couldn't finish it together.
Total was $17, not bad at all.

Complimentary house soup and dessert soup were both appreciated, but taste-wise they weren't my thing. Will come back to try something else: menu is huge and has an insane number of dishes (200+).",3

I'm not a fan of their food, but I keep coming back here for one great reason; their late night menu is so worth it! The late night menu is basically half price off their dishes and it's a great place to come to at 3 in the morning. You can order a lot of food for a cheap price. I come here to satisfy my late night hunger and it's easy on my wallet:) I recommend the Shrimp Wonton Noodle Soup for anyone who's craving something light and warm in your tummy. And if you want to just snack on a bunch of things, you can order duck, chicken and roasted pork for a cheap price. And if you want something to stuff you up before you go to sleep, I like to eat the Salted Fish and Chicken Fried Rice; but warning, don't order it if you don't like fish because the salted fish is meant to be strong in taste!!!!",3
1299726,xhVUUQKFBlcw-y9FIRxNnA,JGEJCYz7gbnOtxbgXB-zSg,"So I've been here twice.. But my review is based off my most recent visit which was Sunday night 

We got there with a complete group of 8 and granted it was a busy night for them. But there were still tables vacant. We stood at the front of the door way for about 15-20mins before I got frustrated enough to go up to someone and ask when would we be seated. There also was another group of 4 waiting to be seated. 

I'm not trying to sound like there was a cultural preference... But while still waiting to be seated... Another group of 7 arrived (Chinese) and started talking to someone in Chinese about getting seated I'm assuming and they started to walk them to a table BEFORE SEATING US!!!  So I said EXCUSE ME!! And put a stop to that quick. 

So finally after getting seated... It was about 20minutes before anyone came to take our order. Again granted it was busy... But that should be no excuse. And remember that 7 person group that was Chinese trying to skip us... They ordered before us... And their food came out before anyone even came to get our order!! 

I HAD TO GO UP AND GET SOMEONE AGAIN to come to our table, take our food and drink order. They didn't even get our drink order... They had only served us hot tea. I was LIVID. We kept seeing others people food come out before ours and my patience was running thin. 

I promise you it was almost 45 before we GOT UP AND LEFT!! We were able to get two sodas and they were asking US TO PAY FOR THE SODA! And I had to tell them that is BS and it should be on the house!! We even ordered soup- THAT COULDA BEEN THE FIRST THING TO COME OUT!!! But NOTHING!! For 45mins!! Bad form and unacceptable! 

My parents were livid and my mother even started a mild fight with the manager on the absolute HORRIFIC service we received!! 

The first time we went we brought them big business!! 33 people!! And the food was actually good and decent. And obviously our food didn't come all out at the same time but one at a time. - that's how it shoulda been on Sunday! They coulda given us the dam soup first at least 

I PROMISE YOU we are NEVER going back to this establishment",1

We ordered 2 entrees (1 Mongolian beef and 1 steamed chicken with veggies) and salt and pepper squid as an appetizer. The Mongolian beef came out first, we waited seeing if the appetizer would come or at the very least some rice. Well the rice came literally 10 mins after the first entree, then the chicken and appetizer was nowhere in sight. We cancelled the appetizer and attempted to eat the entrees, which were OKAY but definitely not worth all the drama. Mongolian beef was decent but the steamed chicken was NOT good, the chicken looked malnourished literally no meat but was seasoned nicely at least. They brought out come corn egg drop soup which lacked flavor but it was free so whatever. The lack of attentiveness (white rice 10 mins after entree arrived) and them basically forgetting the appetizer was the last straw, l will never go back",1

Definitely my Go-To place whenever I'm craving yummy delicious authentic Chinese.

I always order the fish filet in black bean sauce. OMG sooooo MOUTHGASMIC! I also order the barbecue pork lo mein, The smoky panfried flavor on the noodles is incredible. I also get the sweet-and-sour fish fillet...one of the best sweet and sour dishes in town, and for $7.95 you can't beat that price.
The lady that's always working is always so sweet she totally caters to your table & makes sure that you have everything. You can tell she's a hard worker and genuinely cares about the people that come into the restaurant. So next time you're having that late night craving stop into Hong Kong Garden Seafood.

It doesn't taste like someone's incorrect order was reheated and stuffed in a to-go box. Sometimes you order fried rice from a restaurant and it tastes old, dry, and looks way too dark. I'v e never had that problem here. The combination fried rice is a staple in my household.

I love the green tea smoothie and original milk tea. The boba pearls are hit and miss. Sometime they are smooth and chewy perfection, sometime they are hard and gritty on the inside... Try your luck if you enjoy boba, when it's good, it's good!

I tried the curry chicken, but it was mostly quarters of green bell pepper and and white onion floating in a very thin, almost watery curry sauce. There were literally two nickel sized pieces of chicken in it... It was so ridiculous that I'm sure someone didn't stir the batch well or something, because I wouldn't have expected that type of entree to be passed off on me here.

The delivery person was also nice and friendly, since I did the ordering thru Grub Hub I didn't talk to the staff at the restaurant.

Also I have come to expect subpar service from Asian restaurants in general (in fact no service at all) but I have never experienced such a horrible experience than this ""Bumming Spit Hot Shit"".  Initially, the food was decent and actually quite flavorful, besides the fact I ordered the lamb hot pot with a 5 spice level, it tasted like Kimchi.  I believe they reuse the leftover soups and sauces.  My significant other and I were seated quickly enough, most likely because the restaurant was COMPLETELY empty on a cold winter evening. I can now see why...all was well until the end. Upon asking for a little to go container for the leftover dipping condiment, the lady/owner said they do not give containers for the sauces. Cilantro, spring onion, chili oil, etc costs next to nothing, yet alone the 0.02 cent container for the sauce. After the Kimchi flavor in my soup, I came to the realization they quite possibly DO reuse their soups and condiments.  I was so upset to waste the leftover sauce that I poured it into the teapot and filled it with my chopstick wrapper and napkin, so they will not be able to subject other patrons to endure their leftover reuse of product.  I sincerely hope this place doesn't last, next time I will go all the way to Henderson to have AYCE Chinese hotpot on Silverado and Maryland.  This place sucks! They need a lesson on sanitation, service, and business.  They just lost a major patron with huge retention potential...God help this establishment!

I had the lamb hot pot and my partner had the beef hot pot ($9.99 each). The lamb broth had a vinegary tang to it, which I liked and the beef broth had a good hearty flavor. Both came with tofu, crab sticks, tofu skin, mushrooms, a fish ball (with pork inside), bok choy, carrots, tomatoes (ideal for a good broth flavor), and their respective meats (thinly sliced). We ordered add-ins of fish balls ($1.50) and noodles ($1.50), which we split between us, and spicy level 4.

The broths were very flavorful and you could adjust the flame below if you wanted it more or less bubbling hot.

It was our first time there, so the owner was very helpful in explaining how it worked, which we both appreciated. She also showed us how to do the sauces, even offering to make one ""special"" for us. I mixed green onion, cilantro, and garlic oil; my partner was quite fond of the garlic oil and Chinese BBQ sauces together.

Tip: the ingredients can be quite hot, so take out the goodies and put them on a plate to cool off a little before wolfing them down.

I got the tendon radish hotpot and extra stuff in it and the #3 level, it was soooo spicy! The owner was so nice and gave me more regular broth to try to tone it down.  Luckily my boyfriend had #2 and he LOVED the broth *and he's white!* so i just used his a lot haha.

Service was meh - I wasn't really expecting anything. Nevertheless, we had one hotpot that was spicy, and the other not spicy. The hotpot soup was good, spice level was decent.

You can request the level of spiciness of the soup base.  You go to their sauce counter and mix your own dipping sauce and you are set.  The hot pot comes out to you all cooked with a variety of vegetables, bean curd and tofu.  The food wasn't bad but I think I would have enjoyed it a lot more in the winter time.  Oh I forgot to mention that we also had their homemade boiled dumplings. You get 12 pieces for only $5.  It was a good deal,  very fresh and tasty!!  Two thumbs up for their dumplings.",4

Do not go to Booming Spot Mini Pot.
It is not worth a shot.
Though they're nice, 
And have no mice, 
They had not the food I sought. 

I ordered the beef mini pot, 
Which stayed scalding hot. 
I burned my tongue, 
And coughed a lung, 
Until the flame was fought. 

In my friend's mini pot, 
She found a hair left to rot. 
The hair was not from her head.
""Whoops"" the waiter said. 
I kid you not. 

I will not return to Booming Spot Mini Pot.

Since being back with the new owners I realized what I loved so much about the old place. The old owners were amazing! They had great customer service. They checked up on my party multiple times during the visit. One time a friend of mine ordered a pot way too hot for him. The owner kept peeking in and checking till he finally admitted his mouth was on fire. They happily remade his pot for him. 

These new owners never checked on me once. They never came by to refill my water. They never asked how the dish was. I am pretty sure they screwed up the order because my dish had zero spice. My server walked by me more than a dozen times without acknowledging my existance. 

The pots are much smaller than before. pretty standard for hot pots in Las Vegas. The customer service disappeared completely. There are much better options.

Most of these reviews are for the OLD place with the FORMER owners. I wouldn't pay any attention unless it's been written in the last 2 months.",2

Needless to say that the food is AMAZING! I have eaten in almost every chinese food restaurant in town from expensive to a hole in the wall place and this is un my top 2 now.

A huge plus for some starving people and the guy was nice that brought the food and was literally so hot like it was from the kitchen at that second. I did like the chow mein and fried rice alot.

Nice pricing and I would probably recommend when ordering the dim sum try getting there before lunch time because when we did everything tasted as it would fresh out if the steamer.  I am definitely a fan, not 5 star raving fan but still I would come back and get some more food from them if in the area.  I would however recommend that they elaborate on the dim sum selection.

I'd stick with the BBQ combos though because the other food was ok. They also have dim sum items but I didn't try any. The dining area across from the restaurant is small and kind of dirty. I would only eat here again when coming to the International Marketplace...definitely not worth making a trip specifically here. Stick to Panda!,3

Wow, we like it a lot that we went twice during the 3 days we were in LV.  Dishes were so good.  They have a 'BALANCED' taste.  The sweet is not too sweet, the salty taste is not too salty, and the sour taste is not too sour.  I don't know how to describe it but they taste well balanced.

The sign of good food is that you can't stop eating.  That's how it was with my experience.  Every bite was followed by another bite since I wanted more and more.  We finished all of our lunch order dishes. For us the best one was the Crispy Oyster Mushroom with Lemongrass sauce.  Because of this dish, my husband wanted to go back to the restaurant instead of trying other vegan places in LV.  I did try bravely to have the seaweed stems.  Surprisingly, they were good.  The Crispy Eggplants and Crispy Beef dishes were also delicious but we prefer the Crispy Oyster Mushrooms dish.

The price was also so reasonable for lunch specials.  The service was attentive and friendly.  I wish that I can try more dishes before we left but we only have one stomach and only a few chances to dine here.

We will come back to this place again when we have a chance in the future.  I hope that this place will continue and be successful.",5
1338213,25KkE5acsTjOUxuhfyp1Jg,QY8CBhPwv6dE4onjhj6MDg,"I loved this place.

The service was amazing for casual dining. The ladies all helped us, were constantly smiling, and always checked up on us. They refilled drinks promptly, they took requests for sharing plates and napkins quickly. It truly was a great first experience.

I've heard great things about ""fake meat"". I've heard that their are delicious fried chicken sandwiches at Veggie places that rival the real thing.

I willingly tried out veggie house for lunch with two friends.

They have a large menu of vegan and vegetarian dishes. Many of them feature tofu, veggies, and ""fake meat"". Sorry I can't figure out a better sounding phrase.

Anyways their lunch special comes with soup, brown or white rice, and an entree. I don't remember the price but the lunch portions of the items were big! I want to say it was $7-$8 for their lunch special.

Between the here of us we had beef and broccoli, Kung pao beef, and their famous crispy beef.

All of the entrees were served with their traditional veggies. Like the Kung pao had water chestnuts, onions, ect,

The veggies on my beef and broccoli were a large portion. All of their ingredients are fresh. 

And let me get to the meat. Upon first bite it truly is a great substitute to meat. It really does taste relatively close to the real thing. They have the texture right. All of the dishes had the same traditional flavors you'd expect. The crispy beef was the least like beef IMO since it is fried it tasted more like fried batter. It was still tasty. Their brown rice was cooked perfectly. The soup had a very mild flavor. It was like a veggie broth.

Last we had a vegan pumpkin cheesecake. It was a good ending to the meal. It was light, sweet, and pumpkiny. I still prefer regular cheesecake.

Am I a convert? No. It did make me rethink all the salt and meat I eat. Will I come back here and was the food good? Yes!

Scallop dish was ok but im not a fan of the chewy ""scallops"".

My buddy reluctantly agreed to meet here for dinner since I am pretending to be vegetarian for the month.  It's a good thing we got here a little before 6pm on a Tuesday because every table was taken in 30 minutes with even more people waiting to be seated.  I can't think of another 2nd floor plaza restaurant doing business this brisk except for Ichiza.  Good for them!

General Tso's (or Tzo or Tsao or Zao or whateverthefuck) chicken was as close as you could get to the real deal and the unanimous favorite dish.  We annihilated it.  We also got the Mongolian beef which was gluten/tofu heaven and the spicy, crispy eggplant was deeeeeelightful.  

I also had the honor of esteemed Yelper, Tony T, stopping by to say hello.  He said he preferred the seafood dishes over the others.  That kind of surprised me for some reason but I will definitely go for some of those next time.  How does one make vegetarian scallop in the first place?

The key thing about eating here is that one must know what to order. Otherwise, it'll be a bust. My first visit was fabulous. I ordered the bean curd with bamboo flowers and vegetables and also got to sampled the lemongrass and mushrooms dish. They were both excellent!

On my second visit, I asked for the hot and spicy Szechuan tofu. Personally I don't like non-fried tofu so I made sure to ask if the tofu in this dish is fried. There's definitely a language barrier between me and the server as she nodded her head and said yes to my question. When the dish arrived, it was a mass of white and mushy tofu cubes in a brown sauce. Clearly the tofu was cooked, not fried. After I clarified that I wanted it fried, the dish turned out okay. There wasn't any vegetables in this dish, just tofu in a sauce. Hence, this dish was as boring as it can be. Pass.

The owner is a charming and gracious woman. And the dish- I had oyster mushroom and lemongrass sauce- was tasty. My friend, a confirmed meat-man, liked the soup and the spring rolls very much. The fried oyster mushroom had that juicy interior that all fried foods should have, but don't. A big plus. My guess is that most people would find the Veggie House surprisingly good. However...the sodium and fat that is added in order to accomplish the transformation of vegey  into meat taste is, for me anyway, overpowering.

The eggplant flavor was better, but the texture still seemed dry and overcooked. I was shocked by the lack of vegetables, a few florets of broccoli and no other vegetables.

It also delighted my meat-eating family members who are normally not so receptive to veg food. If you brought it to a potluck nobody would suspect it wasn't 'real'",5

1) This place feels like home. So you probably wouldn't want to walk around barefoot or apply the 5 second rule to that fallen gummy bear, but the waitress could have been my momma in another life. She was so caring, so helpful, and completely satisfies the ""house"" portion of the name ""veggie house"".

2) I love my meats, but I their beef and scallop dishes can almost deceive you into thinking that you're actually eating meat! Texture-wise, not so much. Flavor-wise, yes yes yes! Dead on precision. Love it!

3) Price point is aight- a bit more than $10 a plate for dinner. We snatched up a groupon. You might want to put some feelers out there if you want to knock some bucks off your bill.

Enjoy this wonderland, my wonderful veggie lovers!",4

I was worried about this place at first, because there were SO many options and I couldn't believe they were all vegetarian! I saw crispy beef and pork and scallops and my head almost exploded. I bought the Crispy Noodle Fried Scallops and they are to die for. I couldn't handle it. I was in heaven. 

My boyfriend eats meat but got the honey walnut shrimp. I think he was expecting it to taste like the stuff from Panda Express but the sauce was a little different and he wasn't a fan. More for me, I was so happy.

The second time we went, he ordered the orange crispy beef and I ordered the crispy scallops again. I was just as happy as the first time but ended up eating all of my boyfriend's food again. That crispy beef reminds me of jerky, but less chewy. Crispy, thin, and DELICIOUS.

It still astounds me how they can offer so many vegetarian options, all that actually sound appealing. I went to the market underneath them (as they are upstairs) and they actually do sell vegetarian meat substitutes in there. I can't make it as good as the people at the Veggie House, so I will definitely continue to come back. 

Also, the servers are always so sweet!!",5

I am not a vegetarian or vegan but I didn't miss the meat at all! Everything we got was so flavorful and so tasty. We got the crispy beef, walnut shrimp, salt and pepper tofu, and crispy oyster mushroom (my fav!). I wish we lived closer to this place but I think every time we come to Vegas, we will stop by here. I truly recommend checking it out and trying something different.",5

I went on a Friday evening with friends and started with an order of fried wontons and they were delicious! Just the right amount of crisp and not greasy. The inside of the wontons had a creamy consistency and the dipping sauce was great!

For the main dish, I ordered Spicy Veggie Crispy Beef. My first thought when the server brought it out is how much it looked like real meat! This is the perfect dish if you like spicy, crispy foods. I do not care for white rice, so the brown rice that came with the dish worked well. The best , yet unexpected part of the dish were the nuts on top! This sealed the deal and I am definitely a crispy beef believer now.

1338244,duTg4e-FNJishsyVBkevgQ,QY8CBhPwv6dE4onjhj6MDg,"I know this review will mainly appeal to vegetarians but don't ignore it all you non-vegetarians!  Consider a veg restaurant part of your adventurous Yelp eating!  Is fake chicken really that different from cow guts?  Well yes, but..... what I'm saying is: don't be afraid to try it!

Chinatown isn't exactly the easiest place for vegetarians to visit - a menu can be daunting enough as it is, but then to throw in the question ""is there any (chicken stock/fish sauce/bonito flakes/meat bits) in this dish?"" and be prepared to blow some minds, including your own.  I don't enjoy blowing minds so sadly I don't visit many places in Chinatown.

But hey!  Don't fret, vegetable lovers!  Veggie House is awesome and will fill your Asian-food cravings.  They have a huge menu which always throws me for a loop (I'm not used to so many choices!) and everything they offer is vegan.

The first time I visited Veggie House, I made the mistake of trying to be healthy and ordered an all-veggie stir fry dish.  It wasn't bad, but I've come to find out that they specialize in fake meats.  Now, I've been a vegetarian for over six years so I'm not the best person to ask on how much the fake meats taste like the real deal but I'm going to go ahead and guess ""not very.""  I also want to say that I don't care because I find the food here delicious.

Things I've had that are really great: General Tso's chicken, crispy beef, orange beef, sizzling chicken (think an Asian version of fajitas), and curry roti.

Things I've had that are skippable: vegetable soup, spring rolls, the happy sushi roll (way too much of a fishy taste for me, but my husband liked it).

Service is friendly and the restaurant is clean and large.  My only complaint is that I wish the items were a dollar or two cheaper so that I could feel better about ordering a third item to share with my husband instead of the usual two (yes, I'm a pig).  But fake meats can be pricey so I understand.

The ish! And it's all meatless.  We ate soooo much but at the end of the meal we didn't have that dreaded feeling of ""the itis"" since everything is on the healthier side. Everything was served so quickly,  if you're in a rush then this spot is for you. Also if you like crazy delicious food that won't leave you feeling guilty then this place is also for you. Don't be fooled by the fact that it's vegan and vegetarian,  the food is as good as, if not better than its meat filled counterparts.  I'm mad that I'm not eating there right now.

During this time it is quite hard to find restaurants that a full vegetarian menu.  We tried the Veggie House and let me tell you it was amazing.  The food portions are big enough for two and three.  We had the house lomein, the eggplant with tofu, the spinach salad, and hot and sour soup.  The salad was very good. The lomein had the fake chicken, and fake shrimp with vegetables.   To be honest I couldn't tell very much that it was an imitation. My daughter loves Shrimp and she loved the ""fake"" shrimp. My  husband loved the eggplant.  The hot and sour soup was okay. We are very particular about our hot and sour soup.  But overall we love it.  We'll be going back again very soon.",5

For appetizers we ordered Spring rolls and the Roti dish. The spring rolls were tiny but perfect!!! Comes with a sweet and sour sauce. They are crispy and tasty. The Roti was my favorite! I could have eaten 4 orders! The sauce is a coconut curry-ish flavor and the bread comes out warm...mmmm so good!!

We also ordered the braised tofu and veggies, ok....exactly what you would expect. We also had the generals chicken and chow fun noodles both were really good. You wouldn't even know it wasn't actual meat. 36$ for 3 of us (without tip).

The honey walnut shrimp was also delicious. 

I wasn't a huge fan of the beef broccoli. The texture of the ""beef"" was spongey and just reminded me that it's not real meat.

The location is a little tough to find (2nd floor, corner, in a strip mall), but upon arriving your are greeted by an amusing sign forbidding you to bring any meat into the restaurant (no BYO meat!  lol).   The menu has a lot of options (which are played on 2 TV screens as you wait  *drool*).   Having read the Yelp reviews we decided to go with a bunch of items including some of the favorites:  Roti, Lettuce Wraps, and Crispy Spicy Eggplant.  The Eggplant dish was tasty but you definitely want a larger group to take down this platter.. nice and crispy, but obviously very fried.. good flavor.. and probably at least an entire eggplant.   The Roti and Lettuce Wraps were two of the favorite dishes.  The entrees came with tasty brown rice.  We opted to avoid the ""fake meat"" style dishes and went more with the vegetables/tofu/fried rice/noodles-type dishes.  Dessert was decent - vegan ice cream was tasty, but a tad icy and the fried root was only good as an ornament in my opinion.  vegan cheesecake was pretty yummy.  

When we arrived there were ~5 other tables... not bad for Weds at 7:00, but not busy.  However once our food came out (remarkably quickly!) the business started to pick up!  When we left most of the restaurant was impressively filled.  

Overall a good experience, quick service, tasty food.  The owner was very friendly and came by our table a couple times to chat.  We also saw him cleaning off tables and helping the staff (very respectable).  Would go again!",4
1338258,hXAvTFMsgqBWzGVDJnD42Q,QY8CBhPwv6dE4onjhj6MDg,"It was OK, but my family gave me a lot of hard time picking this one for dinner.  I went to this restaurant because I read Yelp reviews that said it was overall good.  Many of the businesses pay to get rid of bad reviews.  This may be one of them.  The service is good. The food is OK also, but it is no way near the good quality food I had years ago at a similar restaurants.  BBQ pork is great.  The spicy fried eggplant was not. We ordered a crab and shark fin soup, a combination cold dish of 3 items, a fried lotus root cake, a crispy spicy beef, and a fried spicy eggplant dish. The three of us could finish neither the crispy spicy beef, nor the fried spicy eggplant because they tasted very similar. The beef was just fried some thin material, not very good.  
I will be very careful in trusting Yelp review in the future.",2

     Service was friendly, with Chef Ken stopping periodically at tables to check on the customers. Very polite and cheerful staff. 
     The atmosphere inside the restaurant was pleasant with a small waterfall and some little electronic chirping birds (which, upon first hearing, led me to believe some real birds got stuck inside. But no worries they're not real ;). 
     We ordered: crispy eggplant, walnut shrimp, general tzo chicken, and spicy fried beef as well as their hot-and-sour soup. 
     Each dish was delicious although I wouldn't recommend ordering the eggplant and beef together due to their seasoning similarities. Soup had a little too much thickener, but was still tasty. 
     I did not order the Thai iced tea, but sampled some from my party. It was tasty as well. 
     I would definitely recommend the place for vegetarians as well as curious carnivores. 
      With our order we had to box quite a bit, entree portions were larger and I would have  dropped maybe 2.

Seriously...I'm from Hawaii and traveled all over the place and it's so hard to find delicious Chinese food that is not adapted in some way to appeal to standard customers (e.g. too sweet, sticky, salty, etc.).  On top of that, it's nearly impossible to find great vegan Chinese food, so I instantly fell in love.  I tried the raw coconut for my beverage (amazing), the eggplant with friend tofu (OMG), and the lotus root cake with veggie paste (there is nothing like it).  Everything was spiced to perfection, absolutely precise without anything overdone.  This is serious culinary artistry at work and my husband and I left completely satisfied.  If I could eat here every day, I absolutely would.

After extensively perusing reviews here and the menu online, I finally went in to order my takeout- wonton ramen soup, spicy crispy eggplant with brown rice, and green tea ice cream with sticky rice.

The spicy crispy eggplant is out of this world. It's amazing, and I'd come back just for this dish- side of brown rice wasn't even necessary. Delicious way to have eggplant, and despite being a sticky and almost sweet sauce it did not feel like a heavy meal. 

The won ton soup was a bit underwhelming. I did appreciate how the noodles were packed separately for my takeout order so as not to fall apart in the broth, and I liked the won tons themselves. But the broth was lacking. I liked the green taste to it, and it oddly reminded me of a green smoothie, except in broth form. As in, you could taste the veggie vibrancy. But it was still somehow flat. Noodles were also much thinner than I prefer, and seemed to simply be thin spaghetti rather than ramen.

The dessert was underwhelming as well. The green tea ice cream melted very quickly and was also lacking in flavor- I've experienced varieties with more of a chalky texture but stronger machta taste, but this version was on the thin side rather than creamy. Also struck me as odd that the sticy rice was orange.",3

I usually get the honey walnut shrimp but is usually one of the those things you just gotta eat there or shortly after because after that the flavor and even moreso the texture of the faux shrimp becomes more prevalent. Asian style decor and ambiance is cozy with faux fountain and birds to go with your faux meat to boot! 

Service is typically on point and welcoming. Probably my only gripe is the prices of the joint as I was spoiled with the numerous, tasty but cheap ones back home in the Bay Area. Veggie House knows that they're probably the best at their job in doing the Chinese faux meat thing here in Vegas so I reckon they feel they can command the prices they do. All in all I recommend this place for those looking to give their digestive tract a bit of a break, veggie lovers and those skeptical of the wonders of faux meat/texturized soy protein. Come with an open mind and don't knock it till you've tried it then realize you just reduced that carbon footprint of yours.",5

Their fake meat is very good. As a vegetarian I have tried a lot of faux meat products and they are no where near as good in quality as what I experienced at Veggie house. My favorite dish was the orange ""chicken"" and the soft tofu. Everything we ordered tasted good, although my least favorite was the curry dish which was a bit lacking in flavor compared to the explosion of flavors in the other dishes we ordered. The crispy spicy eggplant was very good too. 

My family was very happy with this meal, especially my father who has been lactose intolerant his whole life. He got to try ""cheesecake""  for the first time in his life at age 60. He loved it so much,  and we also ordered the vegan green tea ice cream with sweet sticky rice at the bottom for dessert which he liked as well.

The food here is really great, the service is fast and the entire staff is incredibly friendly and nice. The first time I ever went here the menu was a bit overwhelming and I didn't know what to choose but one of the servers was very open to make recommendations and I finally went with the Crispy Spicy Eggplant. This dish is a must try and I highly recommend it! I've dined here about 10 times and each time I try to get something different but I tend to always gravitate back to the CS Eggplant. As a vegan, this place was a god-send as it's not easy to find somewhere that has a variety of vegan dishes to choose from, and delicious ones at that. I've also brought my family here a few times and even though they are meat-eaters they still really enjoyed this place. Something else that I love about Veggie House is the portion size of all of their dishes. They really do give you a great sized portion that will fill you up and you may even have leftovers (if you can manage to get yourself to stop eating their delicious food, which is unlikely). Each time I'm in Vegas I have to go to Veggie House at least a couple times during my visit.

1338278,j8HMCnG253s9jouHnth6eA,QY8CBhPwv6dE4onjhj6MDg,"This place is amazing.  The food is wonderful, after you finally choose something off the expansive menu.  Everything looks and tastes wonderful, and it's all vegan.  Chef Kenny even came out and sat with us to chat.  The service was impeccable, and our waitress made an excellent suggestion, an eggplant dish, and I was in heaven.  My husband had sesame veggie chicken, and we couldn't decide which tasted better.  We might head over there one more time before leaving Vegas, even though there are hundreds of places to eat here that are closer. We think it's worth the drive.
Amazing tasty food, all vegan,  great prices, lovely ambiance, and exceptional service.  Couldn't ask for more, but I did ask the chef if he would open one in Tucson!",5
1338279,2OPoLxPfnYrbplIYqKlAHA,QY8CBhPwv6dE4onjhj6MDg,Very very good. We went 2x and everything was great. Even not vegan or vegitarian will like the food. I see many main dishes recomended. So I suggest the cheese cake. House lomein was our main course. Also great. While we when eating chef brought samples of the Cajon fish which my wife said that she will order next time we come here.,5
1338280,Tzez6ZXCNEMow1OMC9WRDQ,QY8CBhPwv6dE4onjhj6MDg,Read a blog before visiting Las Vegas about vegan food options.  So we decided to try Veggie House.  My husband ordered the Kung Pao chicken and I ordered spring rolls and Lemon Chicken.  The kung Pao chicken was one of the best vegan version my husband had ever tasted.  I agreed with him.  Now the bad stuff.  The spring rolls were small and cut into two to make it look like four pieces but they were small and not as flavorful as others I have had.  They served them with sweet and sour but no spicy mustard sauce :(  My presentation of my Lemon Chicken had my mouth salivating.  Unfortunately that is where my dining experience went further down hill.  The chicken lacked flavor and was rubbery.  I thought about sending it back and ordering something else.  I can not explain why I didn't.  Not sure if I want a repeat visit in the future.,3
1338281,cbkFbgZJsVy3BqOY6C3Jxw,QY8CBhPwv6dE4onjhj6MDg,"My In laws are vegetarian and I always feel so guilty when we go out because they have such a limited option of things they can eat. I heard about this place from a friend and I am so glad I went there.

Must try items:
General chicken
Eggplant and tofu 
Fried eggplant",5
1338282,clC04GqeAs0iCdxBvxIbBw,QY8CBhPwv6dE4onjhj6MDg,What a diamond in the rough!  One of my good friends took me here for lunch and it was fantastic.  As a 15 year vegetarian I couldn't believe this place had gone unnoticed by me for so long.  Their entire menu is made up of creative vegan items and traditional Asian dishes.  I love hot and sour soup and is one thing I've missed since converting.  I ordered that and I was not disappointed.  The crispy eggplant and lotus root were also delicious.  Great place to eat whether your're vegan or not.  You could probably even trick some of your meat eating friends if your covert enough.,5
1338283,WV3woTMD094nn3mD6wssjg,QY8CBhPwv6dE4onjhj6MDg,"ahhh man....I was so excited after reading the reviews that I think my expectations were too high. I am from an area in southern California that has a lot of vegan options so I have had really fantastic vegan food. Plus I personally make 3 meals a day for my family so I used to eating clean healthy food. I was very disappointed with my experience here. When I walked in I was greeted and seated immediately. It was a typical Vegas hot day so I was super thirsty. After being seated we didn't even get water till at least 10min after being seated. The waitress and chef were so interested in schmoozing with customers they knew rather than being attentive to new customers. After stressing that I REALLY would like some water my waitress brought a full pitcher of water to what I thought was going to be my table but instead filled the glasses of the table next to me! really?!

In addition to no meat or diary my family also avoids oil. So I told the waitress to have my meal made w little oil as possible. One dish came back un-edible. The reason I didn't give a one star rating was because the chef immediately scooped that dish off our table and had them make us another dish. The second dish was good except why all the sauce? It was more like a soup dish than a noodle dish. My recommendation would be to ask for ALL sauces on the side. They completely saturate their dishes in sauce and its like eating soup. too bad.... I will not go back here nor would I recommend it unless you are ok with fried, oily, sauce saturated meals. 

It was also a turn off to see the chef pull up a chair and sit with customers bragging about himself. If you are a regular and you know the chef then you are definitely treated more special. If you are not  or are from out of town prepare to get the stink eye and treated like an annoyance.",2
1338284,Ai4WgtHGqtM6PCjnj6ppKg,QY8CBhPwv6dE4onjhj6MDg,"We love veggie house! I have now visited this place at least 5 times and they have never failed. Some dishes in my opinion, are better than others, but I think the trick is figuring out what you like. Veggie house is a very cute restaurant with a small pond, gazebo, and twinkle lights all in one place. The servers are always very sweet and have not trouble understanding English. They are also patient when my friends and I roll in with 5-7 children as well as accomodating to their needs (forks, smaller water cups, removal of hot tea glasses, etc). Now, let's get to the good stuff.

The spicy crispy eggplant is seriously as good as everyone says. They're like slightly more fiberous (and nutritionally rich) variation of french fries tossed in a sweet and spicy sauce. They are crispy and the flavors are out of this world. We get this every time, but I recommend that this is not ordered to go as they will obviously lose their crisp texture. We get this as an appetizer because everyone just grabs heaping loads onto their plate and is a fantastic appetite-teaser. Their roti with chicken curry is also amazing! We tried it for the first time two days ago and had to put in a second order because the kids couldn't get enough. Even though I make roti (the frozen variation) at home, it had nothing on the light and puffed up roti that was served with that perfect curry. 

My favorite entree is probably the eggplant with tofu because it has thai basil in it! I love basil, so I am unfairly biased to any dish that has basil in it, but this dish is fantastic. The tofu in it is somehow better than in other dishes. A definite winner. Another awesome dish is the braised tofu with veggies because of the HUGE assortment of veggies that come with it. Everything from bok choy, to snap peas, to mushrooms can all be found alongside the braised tofu. My kids of course love the chow fun because what kid doesn't love noodles? The texture and the abundance of veggies is what I dream of from other restaurants. 

While I do cook with a lot of ""fake meat"" at home, I am not a fan of some of the fake meat items from here. Even my husband, who loves his animal products suggests that we go sans-fake-meat because he prefers the vegetable dishes here. The texture of some of the chicken (orange chicken, simmering beef plate) dishes are very strange. They're made from a chinese vegetable with a lot of different layers and are kind of tough and chewy compared to real chicken, but the chicken inside the curry chicken was nothing like this. I don't know how they determine which type of ""fake meat"" to use for which dish, but I say try them all and see what you like. 

Lastly, they have vegan ice cream here and the cherry chocolate chip is on point!! My friends ordered the cherry chip while I got the green tea, and I was envious after I tried theirs that I was stuck with the green tea. Don't pass up the vegan ice cream, or the 10% Yelp check-in offer that they're currently offering. Come one come all for those that are looking to add a little extra veggies to their diet. I promise they'll come in a tasty way.",4
1338285,VMHsgbf6d3RLjajHKZCVyQ,QY8CBhPwv6dE4onjhj6MDg,"Food: It's hard to believe everything in this restaurant is vegan! I got the orange chicken and my boyfriend got the crispy beef. I found myself eating off both plates. Servings are large enough to share, so I could see myself bringing family and friends here. The only thing I wish was that more vegetables were on my plate. The orange chicken came with slices of mandarins which was complemented the faux meat but apart from chicken and rice, I didn't really have a balanced meal of proteins, carbs, and vegetables. (Some might not care, but when I go out to eat, I like to have as much of a balanced meal as possible.) I'm sure I could've ordered a vegetable dish, but that's just me being nit-picky. Anyway, the food was amazing. My boyfriend is a picky eater and even he scraped up the last of his dish. The orange chicken has a complexity that finishes delightfully and not like that vinegar-y overpowering stuff they have at other chain restaurants.

Atmosphere: Is kitschy charming. There's a faux gazebo and garden awnings on top of booths. There's also a bird's nest that chirps every once in a while. That was funny to try and figure out. 

Service: Two women checked on us at the appropriate times. I asked for chili sauce to go with my meal and they obliged no problem. 

Overall, I'm glad Las Vegas has a good vegetarian option that's meat-eater/picky-eater friendly. I'm excited to go back and try every single one of their dishes.",5

Chef Kenny is a wonderfully skillful vegan chef. If you dine in and you're lucky you will get to talk to this pleasant gentleman. I recommend the veggie beef roll or the wontons for appetizer and  The Gen. Tzaos  chicken or the crispy spicy beef is the perfect dinner entrée. Im a huge nut over small veggie places. 5 stars for sure!!!!!,5
1338288,kSDFyLLPFTQm-eRN0ZsUSg,QY8CBhPwv6dE4onjhj6MDg,"Delicious! Just got the General Tsos chicken, brown rice, House chow mein and hot tea. Great meal and a nice break from the Vegas strip food. Not too far from strip if you have a car.",5
1338289,T0mWQR7ZWQTVT6UN2ANHkg,QY8CBhPwv6dE4onjhj6MDg,"Amazing vegan lunch. General Tzo's chicken was super. Shrimp and broccoli was really good. One slight ding for wontons just a bit overcooked, but still tasty. Super nice service and menu laid out to mimic meat based foods made it easy for this mostly vegetarian to order.",5
1338290,Znfo-okCulY1zN8WvztxOA,QY8CBhPwv6dE4onjhj6MDg,"I absolutely, positively love this place!  Even if I'm in Vegas for only a few hours, I stop here before leaving. 

I like to try different things every time I visit, but I always include the Orange Chicken, no matter what. It's so full of flavor & spice (they will alter the spice level to your liking), and it's cooked to a perfect crisp. I like it with brown rice. Orange Chicken is a must!

General Tso Chicken is good, just not as excellent as the Orange Chicken. 

Kung Pao Beef is ok. It didn't do anything for me in the knock-my-flavor-socks-off department. 

Spicy Hon Hon Shrimp is good. It's supposed to be crunchy, but mine wasn't. I think it would better with a crunchy batter. 

It is a 100% vegetarian establishment, but everything I have had was vegan, and other dishes can be made vegan, just ask. Particularly if you're getting fried rice, otherwise, you'll get eggs in your food. So again, be sure to let them know if you're vegan. 

Nice clean restaurant. Super friendly and helpful staff. Accepts credit cards (there is a minimum order amount; I think @ $6). 

Call ahead for carry-out orders. To-go orders come in nice reusable containers. 

Can be tricky to find for first time visitors. It's in Chinatown.  If you're coming from The Strip (Las Vegas Blvd), turn west onto Spring Mountain Rd. Stay on Spring Mountain Rd and once you pass Decatur Blvd, you'll see the Pacific Asian Plaza on your left. It's located on the 2nd level of the strip mall, west of the supermarket.",5
1338291,QeIv3hcQKXfHQPTv7I3Tnw,QY8CBhPwv6dE4onjhj6MDg,Delicious vegan restaurant with many dishes that contain faux meats. We had a spicy eggplant dish and a potato pepper curry.,4

They use rice flour, tofu and other soy based products, but I doubt you'd be able to tell you weren't eating chicken!! This was first time I enjoyed these dishes in over a year. Was so good that I went back the very next day. Lettuce Wrap appetizer was also amazing! The staff is also great! They will take the time to speak with you about your diet restrictions and ensure that was you've ordered is prepared as desired.",5

1338296,YluGnUHqm3yy7s-Fz5zhPg,QY8CBhPwv6dE4onjhj6MDg,"Gave this restaurant 3 stars mostly because of the service. 

We ordered 
- Spring Rolls (average)
- Crispy Egglplant (AMAZING)
- Kung Pao Chicken (good/average)
- Chow Mein with Vegetables (good but very oily)
- Fried Non-Vegan Cherry Chocolate Chip Ice Cream (Would recommend but ask for flavor availability)

I came here with my family of four while the establishment was somewhat busy for lunch. The biggest issue was that there were only 2 waitresses who were both taking orders and serving food, which made the service very slow. The waitress took about 10 minutes to come around to our table and forgot to ask for what drinks we wanted until I mentioned it. In addition, it took a while to get either waitress' attention when we need ed napkins or extra utensils. Lastly, we had ordered the the Fried Ice Cream with Mango Ice Cream, however, our waitress failed to mention that they only had one flavor of ice cream. When we told her about the mistake, she just curtly explained that they only had one flavor in stock. It was just a frustrating experience.

Overall, the food was good, but the service lacking. I would come back to eat the Crispy Eggplant because it was SO GOOD.",3

She ordered the wonton ramen soup & I ordered the lemon chicken. Both were so amazing we couldn't help but split our meals (which we rarely do). We also ordered the happy veggie roll and egg rolls and cucumber salad AND the banana pancake in order to taste as much of the menu as we could in one short stop. All deliciously approved!

My wife and I were unsure of eating vegan Chinese food but we gave it try.

We ordered Walnut Shrimp, Orange Chicken, House Lo-Mein, and Beef and Broccoli. When we first got the food on the table it looked like normal Chinese food. I took my first bite and it tasted amazing. Not just amazing for vegan food but amazing overall! This place is the best Chinese food I've had in years period!!! You wouldn't even think it was vegan.

Fast forward to a couple years, and this time I was able to sit down and try a bunch of different items. I'm glad to say that the quality has been maintained, and I had a real solid meal.

You know the deal with vegetarian restaurants.. They are normally pretty awful. That is because top chefs do not like to be limited on what they can or cannot cook. (they also love meat!) Fortunately, in the hands of the talented Chef Kenny, the dishes here are executed to a high degree, and one can be forgiven for confusing a faux meat dish with the real deal.

Follow the Yelpers advice for ordering at this place. I rarely say this because people have slightly different palettes. But, I believe due to Chef Kenny's consistency, anyone can have a good meal. The spicy crispy eggplant is really good. They reminded me of portobello fries. The crispy beef was another winner. Even though I love the taste of beef, and that was obviously missing, the texture was really good. But, I wasn't a big fan of the faux chicken dishes, but they were good for what they were. I also didn't get the ice cream over sticky rice, I'll be scratching my head over that one for a while.

I'm a pure carnivore. That is how I will be for the rest of my days. I do believe that we need to eat more vegetables for environmental issues. I find this restaurant interesting.

Ambience is not fantastic - overhead strip lighting, a TV stuck to the wall, some strange indoor tent erected over a table and it's on the second floor of a strip mall but it is clean and when you find great vegan chinese food at extremely reasonable prices, who cares? Still thinking about how tasty it all was a week later.  On the next trip to Las Vegas we will definitely be returning to eat once more at the Veggie House...",5

Ordered the oyster mushrooms with lemon grass sauce, spicy veggie crispy beef and Buddha Delight. I was with my Jewish boyfriend so it was nice to be at an Asian place where he could actually choose anything off the menu. He loved the coconut juice he ordered!

The chef came out to explain some of the dishes to my boyfriend because he had a hard time understanding how veggie meat is a thing, which was nice. The crispy beef is really nice and crispy with a nice mild heat, the oyster mushrooms were inhaled and all those veggies were just the thing to get me feeling a lot better. Food came with small servings of white rice (but you can pick brown) and we did not get through it all. If you are not much of an eater a portion is enough per person. 

I ordered the strawberry cheesecake for dessert and was pleasantly surprised to see it was a douhua style confection. Yummy tofu pudding!

The decor of the place was well thought out. They have an area underneath a lighted gazebo for 9-12 people. Water feature which I thought sounded like a waterfall to a pond but I was wrong, it actually came off a makeshift corrugated tin hut roof.

The service here was excellent. Actually had servers who speak clear English, which is a plus! Even the Chef came out and walked around the restaurant to greet customers. 

As for the food. Our first visit we ordered:

WONTON SOUP is great for cold days or if you're sick. Great comfort soup!

GENERAL TSO CHICKEN it was slightly spicy but not too overwhelming. My honey enjoyed this dish!

PAN FRIED NOODLES was the bomb! A MUST ORDER!! If you get this To-Go. Ask for the sauce on the side otherwise you'll come home to soggy noodles and the crunchy noodle helps make this dish what it is. 

FRIED BANANA with Vanilla Ice ""cream"". Typical fried banana dessert. Not too sweet. Good flavor. 

On our 2nd trip we ordered...

CURRY & ROTI (appetizer) ORDER THIS!! You will not regret it. I think it's one of the best curry dish I've ever had. I would order this as an entree if they offer it!!

ORANGE CHICKEN...lightly deep fried but was surprise with the spiciness of the dish. Not my favorite but still a contender for those who like sweet, spicy and crunchy. 

CHOW MEIN was excellent. I had it the next day for leftovers and still tasted awesome. A little oily but very flavorful. 

I recommend getting the noodle dishes here. You won't regret it. I'm not a huge fan of Chinese food but I was this week!! 

Thanks Veggie House for offering so many vegan options!",5

I loved the hints of Thai basil and ginger--could have used even more of both.   We asked for it spicy (5 out of 10), but it arrived without heat.   The waitress kindly brought a small dish of chili pepper sauce.   There was really enough for 2 on this $10 entree.  

Now for the shrimp with walnut sauce, which was surprisingly horrible.   The shrimp itself was probably OK, but it was slathered up with soy mayonnaise.   It was visually unappealing as well.   We asked Chef Kenny about the sauce and he returned moments later proudly holding a jar of store bought soy mayonnaise.    This is one short cut that should have been avoided.   Chef Kenny--please rethink this dish.   It would have been a winner if you had 3 dipping sauces for the shrimp.   Perhaps a sriracha sauce (siracha blended with soy mayo), a curry sauce, or a cilantro sauce.  Email me and we can work on this together.  I can visualize this dish with 3 little dipping bowls on the plate with a little cilantro or basil garnish.   Clean, colorful, simple, and gives the customer the choice of condiments.

Oh, enter the restaurant from the front which faces Spring Mountain Rd.   Just go up the stairs and look for Suite 203 in the corner in the middle of the mall.   If you park around back, you will miss the beautiful entry way.

My friends and I ordered fish, crispy noodles with vegetables and ""shrimp,"" and crispy beef. You can obviously tell the fish wasn't really fish. It reminded me of tofu, but with a crispy lining which serves as the skin. The sauce was very salty, but was tasty nonetheless. The crispy noodles were good and I have to give props for the shrimp because it looked real and tasted good. My favorite dish is the crispy beef. The taste and texture reminded me of beef, but it didn't have much substance. It was like eating something with a lot of air pockets. 

The location is in a plaza with other Asian restaurants. I might give this place another shot and see if their other dishes are good. The overall flavor profile I got from this place is saltiness, but it could have just been due to what I ordered.",3

Finally after looking at my meal and my offering to pay for our lunch if he tried it, he reluctantly took a bite. Of course he enjoyed it and said if he had not been told it wasn't meat that he would not have known. He liked it so much that he picked up the tab & agreed to return in the future so he can try the lettuce wraps in spite of the fact that they include tofu which he thinks he hates & never eats.

The memorables were the Eggplant and a Seafood dish with ""fish"" and ""shrimp."" The sauces were amazing, particularly considering that they did not cook with garlic or onion, as they practice a form of Buddhism that does not integrate these into food.

We sat next to the the makeshift pond where they had water dripping off the roof of the gazebo with fake birds that would chirp every now and then.  I thought it was kinda cheesy but also kinda relaxing and nice.

We ordered the roti with curry, pan fried noodles and Cantonese pan-fried ""fish.""  Our friendly waitress convinced us to try the Cantonese pan-fried ""fish"" after debating between that and a tofu dish.  She said we can order tofu at any Chinese restaurant but the ""fish"" we could only order there.  We were sold on the ""fish!""  The roti was so delicious - it was like fluffy, heavenly crepes with delicious curry sauce for dipping, my BF still can't stop thinking about it to this day!  The pan fried noodles were crunchy with a delicious, savory sauce and the Cantonese pan fried ""fish"" really almost tasted like fish.  It was pretty creative how they wrapped the faux fish loaf with nori to give it a seaweed flavor.  We were happy we went with the waitress' suggestion!

We had a groupon, which we weren't allowed to use with the lunch special and we had forgotten the details of the groupon because we have so many.

I went for dinner and ordered mapuo tofu, chicken curry, miso soup, and snow pea sprouts. (for $14?!?)
Everything was at least $10 except the soups that were around $6.

The waitresses spoke to us in Chinese; however I felt that they didn't understand what we said or ordered because they got our order wrong and could not understand when we asked for a container for soup and a plastic spoon in Chinese. 
They seemed more fluent in Cantonese I don't see why we couldnt just communicate in English.

The food was also very salty. Everything we ordered was super salty almost unbearable.

What really got me was how overpriced these plates were. Being Taiwanese Chinese and vegetarian for 3 years, I can vouch that other chinese vegetarian places would not charge as much. 
Theyre usually around $8 per plate and for a plate of steamed veggies would NOT be $14! It would be much cheaper than the regular plate, around $6-7.",2

Also, if you get the order wrong and the vegetarian who ordered off of the VEGITARIAN MENU cannot eat the food because you messed up the order, then you should probably either deliver a new one and take the old back, or maybe...I don't know...give their money back since they just  couldn't eat it.

The wonton soup was huge and full on wontons, shrimp, pork, and vegetables. It was a little bland, but nothing a little soy sauce and chili garlic sauce couldn't fix!

The shrimp chow mein was also very tasty. I've had better shrimp in my life but it wasn't bad.

The general chicken is BOMB. Sweet and spicy.

The house fried rice was a little bit of everything and delicious.

The Thai tea was good. And all for $30!",4

I am allergic and told the guy behind the counter. I get my food home and notice a shrimp in the wonton soup. I go back and present my food which they gladly remake. I get home again and start eating. Halfway thru the wonton soup, guess what I find? Another Shrimp! Now I'm angry and disappointed. The blatant disregard is something INEXCUSABLE. This could have literally killed me. I will not be back due to their inability to execute a simple dish twice and potentially making me sick beyond belief. I hope the owners see my post and realize you can't disregard food allergies and  expect repeat business.",1

I ordered Barbecue Pork, Cheese Rangoon, Pork fried rice, and Mongolian Beef. The staff said the order would take about ten minutes. The bill came to about thirty dollars.

The staff were kind and friendly. The order took about twenty minutes. When I got home, the food was at perfect dining temperature. The Barbecue Pork was tender, but a little fatty and overly sweet. The Cheese Rangoon were tasty, light, and flavorful. The pork fried rice was a tad greasy and a little bland. I make far better at home.. The Mongolian Beef was ideal, a great mix of spicy, sweet, and crunchy.

The portions were enough to feed four, so, not bad for the price overall. I would go back to try other menu items. Definitely not the place to going you are keeping to a diet.",3

However, Tasty China has their own website for online orders and online orders CAN NOT CHARGE EXTRA for to go soup containers. Do not call in for orders, they will charge you for to go soup containers. I came home and opened the bag and there was no egg roll for both meals.

I am always looking for decent Chinese food and it isn't easy to find, no matter what area I live in. I usually end up settling for Panda Express just because it's edible. I will be eating at this place for as long as I stay in LV. The delivery was estimated to be almost an hour, but it only took 30 minutes! We ordered the Family pack w/ house chowmein, sweet and sour soup, wontons and eggrolls, bbq fried rice and orange chicken. We also ordered a side of sesame beef. The meal also came with some other fried shrimp things and steamed rice. The house chowmein has beef, chicken and shrimp in it.. possibly pork. Everything was very very good. I was seriously surprised.. so much so that this is the first review I've ever left for any food establishment. The service was also wonderful. I made the entire order online and also paid online. When the delivery was made, the man delivering was very nice and the food was very well put together in a box. I knew we were getting too much food, but I wanted to try a few different things. We will have left overs for a couple of days between the two of us. All together the family deal would have been enough and at a reasonable price. I have absolutely no complaints!",5

Ordered two different noodle dishes and some pork buns!

House Noodle with Pork and Scallion ($7.50). This was pretty good! Not much meat hiding in here though...but the sauce that was on the noodles was good, similar to a Hoisin.  

Shanghai Fried Thin Noodle ($9.50). The noodles come in a thick clear gravy-like sauce that makes the crunchy noodles soft on the bottom. The flavors were ok here, but I would pass on this next time.

But THIS is the reason you should come here!

Pan Fried Pork Buns ($7.50). These were DELICIOUS!!! Crispy outsides with VERY juicy insides. They come out fresh and piping hot!  And I didn't care how hot they were...I would eat them and still smile as they burned the inside of my mouth LOL.  These are the best I've had so far....Delicious!

They bring the check WITH THE NOODLES STILL ON THE CHECK!!! I ask my friend to tell them to take that off since we didn't eat it and the cashier starting acting up!!! Throwing the check to her coworker and slamming it around. She then told my friend she didn't know what was on the plate and that it wasn't ""long enough"" to be a hair..............

One of our group had been here and she liked it very much.  She arranged the lunch ahead of time.  Since she's from Taiwan, there is never a language problem when we're with her in Chinatown.

For lunch, the 10 of us shared these Shanghai style dim sum selections: soup dumplings (XLB),  crab and pork soup dumplings, pan fried pork buns, beef fried buns, pot stickers, spicy won ton, rice cake stir fry with pork and cabbage, Shanghai fried thin noodles, red bean pan cake, and eight treasure rice pudding.

All of us liked the food very much.  I found the XLB to be a bit bland.  My favorite was the Shanghai fried noodles.  I'd go back just for that.

Service was excellent.  Shirley spoke with the staff for the most part, but the hostess and one of the servers had great English so we'd be OK if we went without Shirley.

The restaurant is very nicely appointed.  It's not very large but can hold several large parties like ours at their large round tables.  The parking lot is very, very small!

I have to come back and try this for a regular dinner, not just dim sum, to get a better feel for the dishes.  But, this was a very good lunch!

Edit:  My photos don't do justice to most of the dishes.  I was sitting in the wrong section of the circle and those from our group started digging into the dishes before I could get a photo of the entire dish.  Plating was very nicely done!",3
1397775,VPITUkY87UNBsq5GFOjllQ,xzEhmFvpuS_MlmMNTh2egg,"Food: The food is surprisingly good. We ordered the shanghai dumplings, shanghai pan fried buns, salty rice clay pot, shanghai style stir fry noodle, and ja jeurng meen. Don't order the curry beef stew, it wasn't that good. This place (I'm going out on a limb here) is comparable to food from SF or LA, and may even be cheaper now. Be prepared to wait for food sometimes, especially any type of bun/pastry related food. It's hit or miss, sometimes we had to wait 30 mins for the pan fried buns, one time it was only 5-10 mins. They say they are making it ""fresh"".

Ambience: For a chinese restaurant, this place is nicely decorative and spacious. It has the traditional grand Chinese restaurant feel, like you could hold a banquet here. The furniture is nice and doesn't look like they got jt from a cheap furniture store. The have high ceilings so that's an added plus.

Service: They are friendly and speak English, so what's more to ask for? They also seem to be very attentive and polite, despite how understaffed it looks sometimes.

Parking: It sucks. The restaurant is in an awkward cubby hole. More parking in the back, but requires walking.

I interpret that as most of what we call ""Chinese"" here is not only food restyled for the tastes of us gaijin (foreigners) but the typical Cantonese style food that has been the usual ""Chinese"" here for decades.

On a drive through Las Vegas Chinatown, one of our ""adopted daughters"" noticed a sign in Chinese that said, ""Shanghai Restaurant"" and asked if we could try it. Well, that was a good suggestion. The place doesn't look like much from the outside, but the interior is quite pleasant. All the other customers were speaking Chinese, so that's a good sign. 

The staff was friendly and even gregarious, the service spot-on. When I dropped my knife on the floor, I was handed a replacement in about the time you could say ""I dropped my knife.""

Our students ordered Shanghai chicken, rice soup, fish soup, noodles, dim sum dumplings, shrimp, fried eggplant and I don't know what else. My wife wanted pork potstickers, I thought the sizzling beef sounded good, and for our daily vegetable we got the green beans with potato. 

OK, the potstickers were good; the beef was indeed sizzling, with onions and chunks of bell peppers - think of Chinese fajitas. Yummy! The vegetable dish was like fresh string beans with French fries in a Hoisin sauce or similar. I thought it was exceptional. In fact, the students insisted we come back for lunch the next day. 

Prices can add up if you are ordering individual dishes in the Chinese way of doing things, but they have an American-style $6,99 lunch special that is very much a bargain. This is truly delicious and authentic Shanghai-style food and I would give them six stars if I could.",5

On a recent trip to LV (Feb.23) we wanted to get out of the busy tourist area and decided to visit Chinatown for lunch. Had no idea where to stop, just drove looking for the right place to pop up. We pulled over to gas up and behind the station noticed Bund Shanghai and decided to try it.
What a nice surprise. Don't let the meek outside entrance hold you back. You will say Wow when you get in and are greeted so friendly. A very nice interior, amazing menu, excellent service, very clean and the food is prepared to order fresh and hot.
We ordered the Shredded Pork and Salted Fish. Each item is served with delicious soup and steamed rice. $6.99. The fish was so good and the pork was stir fried to perfection.
Our server was so attentive and I shared with him upon the arrival of our check that I will definitely write a review. He was so gracious and kind.

1397778,wajSOJS7R5L-cuV614xqng,xzEhmFvpuS_MlmMNTh2egg,"Honestly don't know why I haven't review this place earlier. I'm Shanghainese!
So, in my honest, shanghainese opinion, this is the best place to get sheng jian bao in Las Vegas. Most places don't fry the bao long enough or quite right so the dough is still raw. This place fries the outside perfectly and you can see the burnt yumminess on the bottom of the bao. The top is glistening with a few sesame seeds. These baos won't explode in your face once you bite into them, but they will ooze out delicious soup. The texture and the taste of the pork is done quite well and the ratio of meat to doughy skin is good too. 

Other stuff I recommend are the shanghainese small won tons, drink chicken, lamb chops, and pork thigh.

The place is a little pricey but honestly, this place is authentic or as close to authentic as you can get to Shanghainese food in Vegas. Service was very attentive for us (maybe because we're shanghainese?) lol. Oh, and park is a hassle. Gotta get lucky with that!",5

First off, this place is really pretty and fancy inside and the staff is friendly and on the ball, providing top notch service that you don't expect in a Chinatown establishment. 

Their XLB was pretty good, but not the best we've tried.  The best things we tried were the stir fried lamb and the rice cake with pork, absolutely delicious!  We also tried the crispy fried salt pork shank, which I wouldn't order again.  It was pretty tough and at the $20 price tag I expected much better.

It is just family level cooking. But the price is restaurant level. Their soup dumplings are ok but not as good as china mama. Their crullers were very greasy and lacking in taste. The glutinous new year noodle and house style noodle were ok but again at family cooking level. Their green onion pancakes were made without repeated kneading to achieve the multilayered effect. They were baked bread with green onions in it. Their pan fried steamed buns were not steamed. Just fried baked buns with little taste. Last but not least the other reviews stating their management's mishandling of bills were sadly true. We ordered soy milk to go with the crullers but it never came after we finished ALL our foods. Told them to cancel and they repeatedly tried to make us wait for it. We declined and the bill came without the $4 charge. But when the credit card bill came, the $4 was back on it. We refused to sign for it and they gave us the correct bill. BTW the place is nicely decorated. This is not a place I'd recommend now. Hope they improve.",2

We were handed menus that were like encyclopedias of Shanghai culinary arts; very expansive with photos of the dishes they offer. For appetizers, a smoked fish dish was ordered as well as Shanghai soup dumplings. The dumplings were as good as soup dumplings get. So good, we asked for another order. The entrees consisted of a Chinese broccoli that was white (looked like cauliflower), sweet and sour pork, Shanghai thick chow noodles, and spicy shredded pork and vegetables. Each dish was prepared like Chinese cuisine, not fast food style. Soooo good...even compared to the best San Francisco or New York Chinese food.

If you are an experienced Shanghai cuisine diner, then you will understand when I say that the chefs at Bund definitely tries to authenticate their cooking.  Almost every dish we had was lacking on something - too bland, too salty, not enough salt...  

They do, however, have the crab xiao long bao, which is hard to find here in Las Vegas.  I will come back if I am craving crab xiao long bao but can't make the drive to San Gabriel, CA.  

I will probably come back if I ever need to treat non-Chinese clients to some Shanghainese cuisine, who may not know any better.   Or if I want some crab xiao long bao.  :)",2
1397786,jh8moiLqGIwZw4-RVwUKvw,xzEhmFvpuS_MlmMNTh2egg,"Came to Bund Shanghai on Thursday for a semi-late lunch. My friend and I originally was going to try A&K but A&K told us they didn't have any xiao long bao so we decided to come to Bund Shanghai. I was in the mood for some XLB! Or pork soup dumplings. 

This was my first time at Bund Shanghai so I was pleasantly surprised that they had Chinese donut on the menu. And after having some amazing green onion pancake during my SoCal trip... I was also craving that. Then I saw soy milk! Needless to say this is what we ordered:

2 orders of XLB
1 order of Chinese donut
1 order of sweet soy milk
1 order of green onion pancake

The Chinese donut came first and I must say, it's pretty good. It was fresh when it came out but I have to also say that I've had better. But I don't see these too often in Vegas so I'll let it pass! :P But eat it when it's fresh or it'll taste really yucky with the amount of oil they used.

Sweet soy milk came out shortly after...but why is it slightly gray in color? I thought it was supposed to be white. I'm also not really used to how they served it here. Normally. I'm used to places serving you plain hot soy milk and if you want it sweet, you get to add the sugar yourself but here at Bund Shanghai, you choose either sweet or salty. They already have it prepped for you.

And then the XLB! I was excited and really wanted to try it since I've heard pretty good things about this place. However, all of the XLB were popped. What does that mean? It means none of the dumplings had soup in them. They had all leaked out. The MAIN point of why this type of dumpling is so good is because it has broth inside them. Our 2nd order of it wasn't any better. It had maybe 1-2 that wasn't popped but the rest were popped. 

Another thing about the XLBs were that... the meat was slightly sweet. That got me so confused. When I ate it, the whole thing tasted really really really weird. So when I ate the meat on its own, I find that the meat is a little sweetened. That is just odd to me. And the meat was also mushy ... T_T so so so weird.

Our green onion pancake came in last. Soooooooooooo, this doesn't look normal. The green onion pancakes I usually have are really thin but Bund Shanghai gave me green onion pancake Americano style. It was literally as thick as a pancake. I tried a bite or two, all the while muttering, ""What the hell am I eating?"" Needless to say, we didn't finish this dish.

Overall, really average. The service was pretty slow. On top of that, it was a huge disappointment. How do you pop ALL of my xiao long baos?!?! I'm not sure if I'll come back .. but if I do, I'm definitely trying something else maybe noodles or something.",3
1397787,UOiKndbsKHcmZZT_j3Ep8w,xzEhmFvpuS_MlmMNTh2egg,"I have just returned from Vegas and ate twice at Bund Shanghai. It was so good the first time; the second time I brought more friends to the restaurant.

As far as a Shanghai restaurant, it is very authentic, perhaps not as good as SF Bay area where there is a vast Chinese population and vast amount of Chinese restaurants, but for Vegas, wow, it's excellent! 

The best things are the dumpling dishes and year cake Shanghai style. Service is better than most of the Chinese restaurants I have been to.

For those who bitch about the service is bad, they are Leona Helmsley wannabes. For those badmouth the food, they need to get new tongues. For those who have nothing better to do than complaint, join the Real Housewives of Wanker county.",4
1397788,bwFPqiLu-8LGKBX2F0hqyA,xzEhmFvpuS_MlmMNTh2egg,"Technically... at 3 1/2 star ... based on two visits. First visit a 4-star. Most recent visit. 3-star.

My first visit was for dinner with some family. 

Golden Sesame Cake - its like a baked sesame bread, slightly sweet. It was a great pairing with the braised pork shank :D picked up the sauce well and nice to put meat in between the cake too ! 

Braised Pork Shank - large pork shank braised to a fork tenderness. A bit salty to eat alone but as i had mentioned previously, it was delicious to be eaten with either the golden sesame cake, or white rice. Comes out whole on a large plate. Great ""huge"" presentation. meat was super tender. great for family dinners. 

Beef Pan Fried Bun - completely different from what i expected. Thought it was going to be the same, in terms of flavor and seasoning as the pork version but the beef version, its seasoned much differently. more of a black pepper seasoning?

Then my most recent second visit for lunch, because we've heard quite a few good things about this place. There seemed to be a huge party going on in the main dining room so we were seated in the room towards the front. Slight lack of air circulation. 

Sweet Hot Soy Milk - First item to arrive. Normally a fresh soy milk is a nice white color, maybe a very slight beige. For some odd reason, this was a grey-ish color. Didn't seem like it was a bad batch. Not sure the reason for the color. I've made plenty fresh soy milk and never been that color. Didn't taste bad? It was a bit sweet, for me, but for my friend... she said it was good. 

Chinese Donut - hot, fresh out of the fryer. Crispy and light. Not the best ive had but pretty good. Lighter than the better versions ive had but pretty good. Easily the best thing of the meal.... surprisingly/unfortunately D: 

Green Onion Pancake - THIS... WAS WEIRD... why is the pancake SUPER CRISPY and FRIED?! ALL the other versions ive had, were all lightly heated and soft. This... had no soft spots... it was crispy all the way through ! ! what the heck ... yeah this was only partially eaten.. didnt even take it to go because i didn't know how to re-heat it, esp since its already so hard... it will get harder (lol...) 

Xiao Long Bao - THIS... was disappointing. We came here for lunch. There was a lunch special for it. 5.95 per order. So we had two orders. Each order has 8 dumplings. First order? ALL had a hole in it. No soup. Second order? All but 2 were popped. From the texture of the dumplings, it seemed like they were OVER-steamed to the point where they popped. The meat, lack of ""bite"". Too soft/mushy? The ONLY good side to this, was the waiter said our orders were come one after another. to stay hot. that was a good gesture. but thats about it for this. 

Service in the beginning was decent. Then after we had gotten our foods, the servers were no where to be found. I had to walk out to the main room to find someone to bring us our check. After that, i just gave up and took the check to the front to pay. Customer attention, not their strong suit. But apparently, not their food either. Super sad. I've heard amazing things about their XLB specifically and that was a disappointment.",3
1397789,VDi7QxmmoK4SuXjhUtsVlQ,xzEhmFvpuS_MlmMNTh2egg,"Bund Shanghai is a little off the beaten path. From the outside, the facade doesn't look like it would be anything good, but once you walk into the oversized glass entrance,  (is it a hint for other customers?) The place has a nice ambience. I don't understand the Chinese music that's playing in the background, but it appease and adds to the ambience they are going for. 

The service is great, very attentive without being too suffocating.

The food, it's great. I've only have soup dumplings over at China Mama, and I have to say, the soup dumplings here and Bund Shanghai is better. Better tasting soup, filled with a little bit more meat...and the wrap does not break easily when you pick it up, but it does when you need it to let off the steam.

Also ordered the beef noodle soup long with the soup dumplings,  the beef is so tender that it just melted as soon as it touched my tongue. The soup base itself is great. Not too strong,  but strong enough to go perfectly with the noodles. 

Only downside was the drinks....wasn't enough. I love Thai tea and I know already that they don't do refills. What sucks is the glass container they put the Thai tea in is a little small. Thing is, I always ask if they would do refills....and one restaurant here in vegas does do refills on Thai tea.

Over all, I would recommend Bund Shanghai to friends and family.",4

I've been here three times now and they may not have the best soup dumplings in town but the service and cleanliness makes all the difference compared to 1900 and china mama. Also, I've seen a lot of reviews in regards to the xiao long bao's and pan fried buns not having soup in them for various reasons but I have yet to have this problem. They always come out juicy and with plenty of broth inside and the pan fried buns have a nice crisp.",4
1397793,80l5YTSLk9hGL7XZ9piHgg,xzEhmFvpuS_MlmMNTh2egg,"I didn't take any photos of my food because I was having lunch with my mom and her friend. Didn't want to be rude and stop them eating before taking photos. Anyways, for a Chinese restaurant in china town, I really liked the cleanliness.

I knew about this place for a while but never went to try it until my mom said this place is better than 1900 on the dumplings and buns. (They kick 1900's butt BTW, price and taste!) 

We ordered the XLB. The skin was perfect, it wasn't super thick and chewy. Much thinner than most places and the soup was fully intact too. I know there were some reviews saying they lost their soup before they were served. 

Also had the fried wontons. Can I say OMG best fried wonton. It wasn't soggy and it was perfectly cripsy. so yummy! Didn't feel like it was oilly too much either. It was like a pot sticker but wonton done that way!

Then my mom's friend ordered a noodle. I forgot what it was, but it was a little on the lighter side. A bit bland but its ok. The noodles were awesome. I usually hate the noodles to be chewy hard but they were nice and soft. They didn't seem overcooked to me. 

overall, the service was great! And I don't speak chinese either. The server was very welcoming and spoke to my mom and her friend in chinese but spoke to me in english noticing I don't understand. Both the servers that helped us were polite and smiling. Honestly, even if you're on good terms with servers out in china town... They always have some kinda rude habits. Didn't get this vibe from them. I was certainly impressed with the servers. They were too polite I didn't even think I was in china town",4

My first impression of BS was how nice and clean this establishment is...no funky odors or dirty smells from unsanitary conditions found in some Chinese restaurants. The decor was very nice and we sat at one of the cute booths. The place settings are very pristine and made me excited to enjoy a meal here.
We ordered some pan fried dumplings which S recommended, stir fried noodles and some har gow shrimp dumplings.

I don't remember the name of the stir fried noodles we had and I don't see them on the online menu here, but they were very good. I posted a picture that looks exactly like it does on their current menu. The noodles had the right chew (like al dente spaghetti) with a very light brown sauce and what seemed like minced mushrooms, maybe a little pork mixed in with julienned cucumbers. It was light and delicious.
The har gow was ok...not much flavor but ok.

The deep fried dumplings had a unique texture combination of steamed doughy dumpling and lightly pan fried bottoms, accented with black sesame seeds and minced green onions on top. The filling wasn't as flavorful as I hoped, and even S agreed they weren't as good as usual...possibly attributed to the recent change in chefs. But they were fun to eat with a little chili sauce to enhance it.

The owners seems to know the regulars and S was treated well as one of them. We got to enjoy a special complimentary jelly-like dessert with pieces of squash that S called the ""inexpensive version of bird's nest soup"", and the owner claimed to be ""good for our skin"".
My rating should be more like 3.75 stars. Good food and a good value for this unassuming place on the Southwest corner of Decatur and Spring Mountain. The parking lot is scarce with additional parking in the back. It's a nice family owned restaurant with friendly service and good food. I'm looking forward to coming back with my family soon and enjoying the other menu items. Xie Xie!",3

Had at least 3 different servers at our table making sure our party of 4 was well taken care of. Water and tea were always refilled promptly. We tried to regular steamed soup dumplings and the crab ones. You only get 8 as opposed to some places that give you 10, but I'd rather have 8 good ones then 10 that are only okay. Both were super yummy. The cumin lamb did not have a lot of cumin like 1900 and Dumpling King. The beef and green beans were tender. Both meat dishes tasted a little too sweet for my tastes...kinda like too much hoisin sauce. The seafood tofu pot was light and yummy with super soft and silky tofu. We will definitely be back to try more items.  Some of the items are a little pricey, but most are on par.",4

As much as I hoped it to better from all the Yelp Reviews I read, I was super disappointed when I finally tried them out. (I was craving XLB all dayyyy and I typically go to 1900 Asian Cuisine for XLB but they were closed the day I went so I resorted to this place). 

The meat filling and soup was way too salty for my liking. Although the dough/dumpling wrapping was not too thick, its texture seemed to be a bit old and not too fresh. Most authentic Shanghai restaurants typically provide the fresh ginger along with the soy sauce, so it was a bit of a surprise to me when I had to order the fresh ginger on the side. In addition to the XLB, I ordered the hot and sour soup-- ya, no go. It was surprisingly bland and needed a bit more flavor. 

Overall customer service was good, but food was eh.",2

My sister and I  ordered the fried pork buns and the duck in brown sauce- both were delicious.  The fried pork bun was light yet tasty.  The duck in brown sauce was super flavorful- the brown sauce is sweet with a hint of star anise and some other Chinese spices.  There are so many dishes on the menu I want to try.

We feel cheated by this place. Really it is the manager, the servers are sweet and even they say that they couldn't do much, that's just her. As someone who has worked at a restaurant before, this place does not deserve your time and money. 

What happened was: We called in 2 days ago with our special order ( Peking duck and chicken soup). We got here at 6pm as per our reservation, waited for 2 hours and finally our Peking duck finally came... Cold! Did they just got a To go order from another store or what? It doesn't make any sense. Oh and mind you, with the 2day ahead order, 2 hour wait... This duck has a steep price of $58! And what was supposed to be hot and crispy duck pieces were cold like salad toppings!

The chicken soup too, taste like ""dish water"" according to my mother. And I agree. I am no chef but I can certainly do better than that.

We then politely spoke to the manager, she straight up said that she didn't see anything wrong with any of our orders. We feel terrible for the servers, to have to work for a manager like this woman. 

As customers, we will laugh at the thought of returning back here. Consider yourself warned!",1
1397807,GioNatD9F4NzyL7nkH-Pkw,xzEhmFvpuS_MlmMNTh2egg,"On the account of my friend's recommendation we visited this restaurant today, Dec.27,14 on a Saturday evening. We missed our old buddy Restaurant, 1900 on Spring Mountain Rd which was closed and decided to venture out for a new Shanghainese restaurant. There are 6 of us, 4 adults are all familiar with Shanghainese food like XLB, drunken chicken etc..We are not looking for the delicious Shanghainese cuisine in Shanghai or Taipei, we just want to have a decent meal of Shanghai style.

I was quite impressed by the ambience and all the elaborate and appetising pictures on the manual, but unfortunately that were all they are good at.

The XLB has strong porky odor to it and there was no soup inside the wrapping. All the cold appetizers like jelly fish, drunk chicken, 3-yellow chicken, bean with Tofu paper are completely different in their look compared to that of the pictures, they must have been in the fridge for days. The chicken were chewy, not tender as one would expect. The jelly fish was very salty.

Of the 4 entries, the fish belly in soy sauce was barely deserve a passing score. But it was not belly at all, it was entire fish without the head. All the others were just put together by an amateurish hands. Shanghainese food are known for their harmonious blending of the soy sauce, wine,oil,sugar together with various food content in hot temperature the bring out distinctive flavor and taste, here in our mouths they are completely disintegrated, let alone taste good.

The service was slow and disorganized. One can easily notice the short staff help. And I wondered what might happen in the kitchen. The last dish, the eggplant stew was waited for 15 min after we finished all the food before it appeared on our table. Waiting for the bill to be calculated was another 15 min wait.

All the glasswares pile up on their bar table to be distributed for take out or for serving drinks. That table is supposed for sitting and for show since they do have liquor licence. The bathroom ran out of soap liquid and the hand dryer broke...

I hope they just had a bad day with the chief chef on leave and we just happened to be there on the occasion. I sincerely hope they can improve in the future.",1

Granted, it was a Friday night around 6 when I went in, but it was quite a while before my food was ready, and I had one entree and fried rice. There also wasn't any nearby parking available, so I had to park a little farther away. It's right next to Cafe Rio, so between that and being in the dinner time rush, there wasn't any close parking. I'm not opposed to walking, it's just hard to manage two small kids and a bag of Chinese food across the busy parking lot. But the food is excellent. There's also usually an ad in the weekly flyer with some coupons- there's one for 2 free crab Rangoon or wontons with the purchase of an entree.",3

We also enjoy the shrimp lunch specials (shrimp chop suey or shrimp with snow peas) and my son is a fan of the sweet and sour chicken.  

The egg drop soup is boring.

I have ordered takeout from the restaurant quite a few times and the employees never seem to remember me or have a clue about my order.

I suppose the issue started when I was ordering the food. I told the girl taking my order that the first few dishes were vegetarian, no meat, fish or eggs and to please substitute tofu. I asked to make sure that they did not use fish sauce and she said 'no we don't use that.' So I proceeded with my order and after each vegetarian dish I stated, no meat, subsitute tofu please. The last dish I ordered was a chicken dish for my father (as he does eat meat).

I did not wait long for my food and the girl was nice enough to bring it out to my table. 

My mom dished out the food and I checked to make sure she did not open the chicken dish (as she too is a vegetarian). I opened the tofu dish and it looked really strange so I took a bite of the food and of course it was meat, I was disgusted. I had bitten into a piece of pork, I had to wash my mouth out. The 'ma po tofu' dish was listed under pork and I specifically told the girl taking my order that I did not want meat. 

I decided I would call to fix the issue, I knew it was a mistake and that there was obviously some sort of miscommunication. I call and speak to a girl (I was not sure if this was the same girl that took my order). I told her what happened and she told me that she took my order and that I never told her that I was a vegetarian. I then stated that I have been a vegetarian for over 10 years and I am fully aware of how to order vegetarian food. I tried to deescalate the situation because it seemed as though the girl was getting defensive and it was a simple mistake. I told her all that I wanted was a refund for the one dish and she said they would only give me credit.

I asked to speak with a manager (because I did not want credit, I wanted a refund for the dish that they did not execute properly. The manager stated that she overhead me order and that I did not state that I did not eat meat and I ordered a meat dish so they would not give me a refund and they would only give me store credit. At that point I became very frustrated. I have worked in customer service industry for over 9 years and I have been in food service for 5 years. If there is one thing I know, it is customer service and she was not treating me like a valued customer. I then told the 'manager' that I did in fact order a meat dish for my father and that I ordered 3 vegetarian dishes for my mother and I as eating meat is aganist our religion. I also told her that after every dish that was vegetarian that I would say 'no meat, substitue tofu.' She proceeded to tell me that it was my fault and we went back and forth. Then she hung up on me.

Maybe I should have checked the food before leaving the establishment. Regardless, I will never frequent this establishment again in the future. Possibly the WORST customer service experience I have had and a complete lack of respect for dietary/religious restrictions.",1

Unfortunately after I wrote this review I had a change of heart. I waited over 20 mins for 1 orange chicken special. I wouldn't be bother by the wait except when others are out before me. After I ordered my food, about 7 mins later two people came in and ordered the exact same thing I had. 5 mins later they walk out with their food.

They always offer refills on my drink and are thoughtful of the service they provide. All the other Chinese restaurants I've sat in, you sit back and watch a busy, self absorbed staff, in loud conversation and chatter-in another language. Almost making you feel like you're interrupting something lol..  Here, it's quiet, clean and the staff's priority is their clients. 

This is officially my fav Chinese restaurant! 

As an example.. While eating dinner there this evening, I saw one of the waitstaff offer assistance to a carry out client who was using a cane. He refused at first, but she noticed he was struggling to get out of his seat. She insisted and walked his food out to his car. Just a typical night at china gourmet!",5

The food is just ok, but again you get what you pay for.

Food Taste: 5
Food Quantity: 4
Service: 3
Price: $$ ($35 with tip and tax, no EtOH, food only for two)
Value: 4

If you like spicy and sour food, this is the place to come to.

The cold noodle dish is prepared with hot chili oil and vinegar. There appears to be random bits of spongy soy product around. Not an issue, especially since they soak up a lot of flavor.

The ""Chinese burger"" is basically slightly salted pulled/shredded beef placed between two pan seared round flat bread. Highly recommended. Add a little bit of the leftover sauce from the cold noodle dish for a little kick.

BBQ: tried the lamb and beef tongue
lamb is highly seasoned, very spicy. There's a hint of game typical of lamb that you can notice, but only if you taste for it.
beef tongue is not as spicy, but definitely a bit chewy. 

Another dish, noodle based, is seasoned like their cold noodle dish, except everything is hot (temp wise), and the noodles are long and thick, with some green onion and bean sprouts. Again, spicy and sour, just the way I like it. Noodles are nice and appropriately chewy. Just the right amount of ""QQ.""

The Service:
it's a chinese restaurant. what more could you possibly expect?

The Ambiance:
See above.

Conclusion:
Sour and spicy food. BBQ is tasty (but spicy!) and not terribly overpriced for what you get. Will return in the future.",4

The smell of smoke from BBQ is good, the smell of smoke from cigarettes/casino is bad. I never made it to the tiny Great Bao location so this was first experience eating any of the chef's creations.  I remember seeing him on TV and enjoyed his story so I felt like I had to try his food. 

On my 1st time the bad casino smoke did a number on me, my eyes were irritated, I had a bad taste in my mouth, and my nose was stuffed. I sat as far as I could away from the entrance but it still had the smell. I originally went with some short rib dish which was about $14 but then I saw that there some pork belly tacos on a chalk board menu for $7 and had them change it.  It was 3 pork belly tacos, slaw, salsa, and fries. I wasn't a fan of any of it, maybe it was the smoke still messing it up. The pork belly pieces were pretty dry and tasted just like cooked unseasoned pork belly. The slaw tasted like the one from KFC which I didn't mine but expected more.  The salsa was bad and fries came out almost at the end when I was almost already done.  Actually I didn't feel like I would ever be back after this visit. 

The 2nd time here went better, joined some friends for dinner. I went away from their special chalkboard menu and ordered the fat choy burger. Most of the tables went with their various signature dishes which included the fat choy burger, short rib grilled cheese, bao, etc. The fat choy burger was enjoyable but I wasn't wowed. It was a 1/2 burger, short rib,  bacon, a fried egg, and the burger usually ingredients between a bun. You'd think with ingredients like that in a burger it would be a freaking amazing but it wasn't for me. I've had better for the similar price. I think it was about $10.

The 3rd time, whenever it happens, will hopefully be the charm lol. I won't try the short rib grilled cheese, don't think I'll like it but not a big grilled cheese fan and it didn't look I'll like it. Maybe I'll stick with their money item the bao, which for some reason I still haven't had even when I've been meaning to try. The only difficult part is I just have to decide on which baos I'm getting. I also have to remind myself to hold my breath while walking through the casino.

Their menu and the pictures posted look good. The staff is friendly and the environment is good, besides the smokiness which I heard has gotten better. But for now I have to give them a 3 point something, 3 1/3, 3.33333 with the bar on top Star which is still good, it's Ok and a lot better than that 2 star meh.

There's some drawings on the wall, it's not fancy but includes things of their past. Double check for specials either on the wall or social media, I'm sure they'll let you know but just in case they don't.

Go for the bao

The pork belly bao features crisp, juicy pieces of pork belly that drips lusciously after your first bite creating a harmony of flavors.

For those of you unfamiliar with baos, a bao is a steamed bun with some sort of filling (associated with Chinese cuisine).
Tried both the duck and pork belly bao. Delicious! The pork belly was braised perfectly, melt in your mouth tender, and I loved the crispy skin on the duck. I prefer the pork belly bao over the duck bao, but it's all subjective. 

The short rib grilled cheese was ok, not great. The short rib was on the drier side, and I wasn't a fan of the tomato sauce that came with it. Maybe they could incorporate different cheeses instead of just using cheddar cheese.",4

The restaurant is in the strangest, smallest casino, but it adds to the quirkiness. It's actually fun how bright it is compared to the dim casino.

The server was very kind and we ordered quickly. The soft drinks are HUGE here! We got the bone marrow to start and then I got the Short Rib Grilled Cheese and my bf got the Pork Belly BLT. The marrow was delicious. Not the best I've ever had but very good quality and flavor for the price. The two entrees, very rich. We looked like jerks only being able to eat half of each sandwich, but after the Jan 1 hangover and barely eating, our stomachs could only handle so much. 

I enjoyed the grilled cheese, and really loved that it had the dipping sauce. It gave the illusion of tomato soup without having the tomato soup. I also like how they use shoestring fries. I'd definitely like to try this place again, and am super bummed I could only eat half of my sandwich (I craved it during the flight). It's definitely a unique take on food in a different location.

About the food: so so good. Highlights/must tries are the short rib grilled cheese, the burgers and the housemade dumplings - all phenomenal!!!

I did a search on Yelp Talk in Las Vegas for best burger, and from the multitude of recommendations, I chose to try Fat Choy.  Their burger did not disappoint...  If you fancy yourself a burger aficionado, you must try theirs!

Fat Choy is a Chinese fusion diner tucked away in the Eureka casino.  The unassuming ambience did not undermine my experience...

What is in the burger?  1/2 lb burger patty, braised short rib, cuts of bacon, subtle sweet sauce, fried egg, and a sweet bun (?).  Also comes with lettuce and tomato.  

Enough short rib but not overpowering the patty--good balance.  

Crispy cuts of bacon adds a crunchy texture on some bites.  Many burgers that come with bacon don't serve crispy bacon.  Instead you take a bite and hope you shear of a clean piece of bacon, but what usually happens is you can't bite off the bacon and end up eating almost the entire strip of bacon in that one mouthful.  Fat Choy cooks the bacon to a crisp and cuts the bacon into squares.  No need to battle with the bacon for a bite sized piece.  While  bacon is not listed on the menu description of the burger, I found the crunchy texture to be a wonderful surprise.    

The color of the bun was either a potato or a sweat bread bun.  Bun--sweet and soft.  My favorite type of bun...

In many ways, a perfect burger...

Service was terrific. Diane was friendly, outgoing, and charismatic. Askd many times how i was doing...  

I am definitely returning to Fat Choy on future visits to Vegas.  I might even try other options such as the pork belly bao which is highly touted in many reviews...",5

started with pork belly sliders, a nice choice, although I think I will try duck ones next visit

buddy had the fat choy burger and really enjoyed the short rib and fried egg topping

again, I should have opted for the duck, but went with a safe choice of won ton with noodles.....nothing special, wontons were good, but not spectacular

to be fair, I will have to come again and try some of the other dishes that are touted

I finally decided to order the sesame noodles. They were decent, not memorable but they had a bit of a kick which was perfect, not too spicy and not too bland. Food took a little bit longer than expected but the waitress was very nice and attentive.

I wouldn't go out of my way just to eat here again. I think the best part of the meal was the dessert and the variety of coke flavors they have.",3
1411038,kM44LpuDfiYgbiz2w6wfkQ,Kxp8cIMt3-vxwtCSsL9QKQ,"A bright gem tucked into an otherwise dark space.

I almost did a double take when I saw where this restaurant was located - tucked inside the Eureka Casino just on the edge of the commercial center.  Its certainly not the nicest part of town (and that is putting it nicely), but in a way this is something that I liked about the space.  Its in the heart of the city, and like any city not all of it is pretty and glamorous.  Also, rest assured, the parking lot is well lit and there is a good security presence such things go awry.

Once inside Fat Choy, it does a decent job establishing its own unique brand outside of the normal casino cafe.  The room has personality that matches its menu.  Our waitress was nice and had a lot of knowledge about the menu.  She recommended the Pork Bao, the duck fried rice, and the special - bone marrow.  I happily ordered all three.

The Pork Bao, a delicious piece of pork wrapped in dough and smothered in relish and peanuts was something out of food lover's day-dream.  The moment I took my first bite I forgot everything about the seedy casino we were sitting in.  I was instantly happy with my choice to dine here.  And I quickly asked for another order as soon as she could bring it.

The duck fried rice was a wonderful mix of rice, perfect duck leg, and salad greens.  I ordered it with a fried egg on top, again from the waitresses recommendation.  Really good flavors.

Lastly, the bone marrow.  I'd read you had to order it when it was on special, and I followed direction.  It was much better than I though, a half-ox bone cooked well and smoothed in sauce.  It comes with a side of fresh toast to spread the marrow on.  It was meatier than I expected, with FULL flavor.  Surprising and unique.

I plan on coming back just for this bright gem.  If you want to try something new, brave the location and give this a try.",4

The beef was gorgeously grilled and flavorful. The eggs were the perfect compliment.  The dish comes with potatoes, toast or salad; I had salad.

This time we split the Duck Bao. The duck was tender and had a little piece of skin! Can you say PERFECT! It's so hard to pick what you want here. Cause I want ALL the things. I went with the special, which was the PBBLT. It was Pork Belly with Bacon, lettuce, tomato and a spicy aioli on Sourdough Bread and a side salad. 
Joel got the Short Rib Grilled Cheese with Fries. He can not stop talking about this sandwich! He said it's not just the best Grilled Cheese he has ever had, but most likely the best sandwich he'll ever have!!!
My Dad had the Crispy Duck Leg with Rice. He was so impressed with it all. He cleaned his plate and picked every piece of duck off that leg.

I am almost ashamed that, until today, I hadn't ever eaten at Fat Choy. I've heard so much about their food starting from their days as Great Bao inside a hair salon (which, unfortunately, I never visited either). I didn't even have this place on my radar until I learned that a certain awesome sandwich shack on Las Vegas Blvd and Wyoming was closed. But when life throws me lemons, I say screw that, I'm going to have a bao.

Co-owner and front-of-the-house extraordinaire Jenny Wong greeted me and told me to sit anywhere I'd like. I went to a booth, got a menu, and listened to Jenny explain the specials of the day (and also learned from her focus of vision that the specials are written on a wall near the entrance). When she asked whether I was ready, I responded that I actually was not quite ready to order yet and instead spent the next few minutes on Yelp searching for an idea of what to get as an entree. Then I made my orders.

I really wanted to try both the Peking duck and pork belly bao. I did not want to pay $14 for a pair of each, as per the menu. So I asked Jenny if I could have one of each instead. She replied that although they would not honor this request if they had a packed house, they would do it now since they were not busy (or else it would take twice as long to fulfill the one request and they'd fall into a death spiral of sorts). I felt relieved at this point, but not happy yet

The first point at which I felt happy came after my order arrived (and after photo time). I happened to bite into the pork belly bao first. It was absolutely heavenly, both meaty and fatty, and is now the standard by which I will judge other pork bao (note to self: revisit that review of a recently opened ramen restaurant). The Peking duck bao, though very very good as well, was not quite as delightful as the pork bao.

I later learned that the special order was priced at $7, the same as if I had picked only the duck or only the pork. Fat Choy is very, very cool.

There were a lot of different recommendations on Yelp for an entree. I figured that they could all be right, so I went for a PBBLT with fries because it was a special, and it also seemed to be a solid value at $9. When my entree arrived, my eyes lit up and my mouth formed a smile because I saw that awesome pork belly (hence, PB) in the sandwich.

However, that first bite of the PBBLT was when I became really, really happy because of all the flavors and textures in my mouth. The same wonderful pork belly, crunchy-ish bacon (it's pretty thickly cut), greasy grilled was-that-really-wheat-because-I-didn't-notice bread, crunchy and cool lettuce, tomato, and sriracha mayo combined to form a true masterpiece. I didn't even realize the mayo was flavored with sriracha, but it worked wonders. I was very, very happy while eating the PBBLT - at least until my stomach started feeling full about halfway through the 'wich, which unfortunately drained some of the magic.

I should have mentioned this one small negative on my feedback card (available at the counter), and hopefully Chef Sheridan or Jenny will read this, but the fries are rather good-average and do not quite match with the other beautiful creations that I enjoyed today. It's not that they were un(der)salted, which was corrected with some salt, but that they don't necessarily complement anything or come with a special condiment. Luckily, I was able to enjoy it with the pork belly and sriracha mayo drippings from my PBBLT, or else I would have had to resort to ruining the experience by actually using that bottle of ketchup, which I most certainly did not want to soil my palate with today. (Minus one star for not anticipating my stomach's desires... just kidding!)

Still, the food and the other positives outweigh the negatives. Jenny was very nice and attentive the whole time. The TVs are in HD, and although I don't know what happens when the restaurant fills up, Jenny offered another table the chance to change a channel if they wanted to. The music, I learned from Jenny, is streamed from Pandora, and I really loved some of the ""selections,"" such as fun. and Rise Against. The cigarette smoke is relatively faint and wasn't even noticeable after a few minutes. I also kinda just like the old diner feel with the Asian decorations and the one wall of assorted stuff (a mural of sorts and some article clippings).

So yes, overall, I had a very happy time enjoying this meal. Even though I'm normally put off by having things of this price range on too regular a basis, I will probably make myself plenty of excuses to come back and smile once again. If you're any sort of pork lover, you must make your way here posthaste.",5
1411046,-JUQLziOTnOj6dE1q5iPUQ,Kxp8cIMt3-vxwtCSsL9QKQ,I tried the famous bao first. It's tasty adventure of flavor and texture. All it is bread with different types of meat in it. I had their bbblt next. It's great tasting with flavorful marinade.  It's bit heavy so be prepared.  They also have healthy choice noodles. This will be my next choice.  Good eating.,4

This place is in a sketchy, rundown casino (no card games... just slots)  Park in the back. It's in old town Vegas so you can visit the Pawn Stars ship afterwards. The tiny casino doesn't serve any hard liquor.... only beer. It's a place for foodies... And a group of cargo-short wearing guys.",4

1411051,sXW0liXCslgXSQ3HkD2zEA,Kxp8cIMt3-vxwtCSsL9QKQ,"Yo Imma let you finish but Fat Choy has one of the best burgers in all of Vegas!!!!
Have you ever had a meal so surprisingly good that you had to go full kanye? Well Fat Choy did that to me. Now I'll be honest, fat Choy isn't a place I would've found normally because it's inside the eureka casino, which is one of those off strip casinos that seem to be filled with the same group of anonymous gamblers. 
The decor is interesting. It's diner style, lots of interesting pictures and a chalkboard with the daily special
Now about that food. There's the pork belly BLT, it's exactly what it sounds like, a BLT with pork belly that's so soft and tender that it's  slap yo mama good. The duck bao was money. I found out after that they started off as a food truck selling that, which makes sense. The piece de resistance is the eponymous fat Choy burger. Im gonna just roll call the ingredients, please try to not drool on the screen: half pound patty, short ribs, bacon, egg, onion jam, plus all the regular burger fixings on a soft bun. I demolished that burger quicker than usain bolt does the 100m. 
Long story short, this place is filthy good. I love this place, everyone I brought here loves it. Odds are if you read this far you'll love it too",5

We will definitely come back here and try all the items! It is located in the Eureka casino and it's actually a pretty ok place.

I had the fat Choy burger without the egg and it was damn good. Only thing I would have liked more was to have a bit more short rib in the burger.  My friends had the short rib grilled cheese and that rocked as well. We ordered desert I had the chocolate cake dessert which was good with the ice cream. I liked the icing on the cake. My friend had the eclair and it wasn't great a little hard maybe too cold from the refrigerator. 
My second trip I'm having the chicken and waffle and the sesame noodles. 
Waffle ordinary nothing special
Chicken perfect with great flavor
Sesame noodles unique flavors but good. A tad bit of heat as well. 
I think the burger and grilled cheese are must haves.",4

1411057,VSJMUxD8aK1_K5aK3hLudg,Kxp8cIMt3-vxwtCSsL9QKQ,"I was surprised to discover this place is located in a casino.  But I don't live in Vegas.  My sis, who does live there, is a fan of their baos (I find always find it funny to hear white people say ""bao""), and since Fat Choy was listed as one of the 38 must-go restaurants in Vegas by some website, she took me there on my recent visit.

We had the duck bao, pork belly bao, and short rib rice.  Both baos were delicious. However, I'm from the Bay Area where we have constant access to Chinatown so bao is not a unique thing.  You can't really ever go wrong with roast duck, so while the duck bao was great, it was no better than any other duck bao I've had throughout my life.  A generous piece of delicious boneless duck in a steamed chinese bun with a bit of greens, drizzled with hoisin sauce.  Yummy but for $7 for 2 pcs, the price was kinda ouch.  I can get half a roasted duck at a chinese bbq restaurant for less than that.  Still, for the non-Asians in Vegas, I can understand the hype if you've never had something like this.  And I do definitely recommend trying it if you never have.

I was more impressed with pork belly, but that's only because that's rarer where I come from.  It was done so well.  Exactly what pork belly should be and far superior to the pork belly dishes I've had at higher-end trendy Asian fusion restaurants.  

The short rib rice was great as well.  I wouldn't call it generous but it was enough.  The short ribs were incredibly tender and seasoned wonderfully.  I was afraid it would taste like nothing more than pot roast (which we make at home all the time in the crock pot and which similar beef entrees at a lot of restaurants end up tasting like even though they call it fancier names).  But the ribs surpassed my expectations.  Came over white rice with a side of salad (with the fancy greens--not the cheap lettuce) and some chopped pickled mustard.  That pickled mustard added a lot to the dish for both my sister and me.  If you're not familiar with it, I'm not sure that you'd really appreciate it though.  

I honestly don't know that I would go back myself because, as I said, I have access to similar types of food here in the Bay Area and at much cheaper prices.  But I might if I lived in Vegas.  One downside is that since it's in a casino, you can smell the cigarette smoke if you're sitting close to the entrance, and it can be pretty bad.  I am so glad California is more prissy about smoking.

The service was really friendly.  Both servers were sweet.  Another yelper said there is a mandatory 15% tip, but I don't think that's true.  When you pay on their tablet credit card swiper, there is a button you can press to add 15%, 20%, or 25% tip, but you don't HAVE to press any of them.  

They also had a nice selection of dessert, including root beer floats!  I bought a red velvet cake home for my white boyfriend.  I didn't try it but he liked it. He said it wasn't as sweet as other velvet cakes he's had.",4
1411058,eadW6dkCMDgG2kY2p375Jg,Kxp8cIMt3-vxwtCSsL9QKQ,"I went here w/ some friends for a social lunch thing we have been doing for a couple weeks. The lunch menu is pretty short but dont let that fool you. We all had something different and each dish look good, so theres plenty to chose from. 

I personally chose the Cheesesteak Sandwich, it had Shortribs, bell peppers and onions, and melted Provolone cheese. I chose this after another in our group selected my initial choice, the Grilled Cheese sandwich (both were incredible for the record, but the grilled cheese had shortrib too, just chopped I believe, I know what Im getting next time!!) there was also a bowl if noodles that I forget the name if but it was also delicious and had a bit of a kick to it, overall the experience was good, the service was good, and the food was better.

We especially loved their baos but  when we ate here recently their baos were different. I had ordered their mushroom & tofu bao & it wasn't the same. If I remember correctly the tofu & mushrooms were cut up but this time they put a slab of tofu which I prefer it cut up & mixed in with the mushrooms. The duck bao didn't taste as flavorful.

The servers were friendly and laid back. And our order was taken promptly and the food came out pretty quick. 

As for the food itself, I got the fat Choy burger and it was great. It was messy and sloppy and all over my plate and the egg oozed all over, just like how any good burger should be. The fries were fine, crunchy and seasoned. The only negative things were that the burger could've been seasoned better and cooked better.

One of our best meals in Vegas and it was nice to get away from the craziness and flash of the strip for a bit.  

The only downside for us was trying to get back to our hotel without a car.  They *called* a cab which never came so we ended up walking 30 minutes in 100 degree weather until we found a cab at another casino closer to the strip.

First time, we went with a group of 4, and the second was just two of us. I love the duck bao, and will definitely go back just for cravings of that one wonderful bite. It's in the Eureka, and if you don't know what you're looking for, you might have a hard time finding it from the outside.

The prices are great, and it's a perfect place for a lunch/brunch/snack while you're a bit busy, but refuse to be rushed. 

Pros:
- The food is great, and the prices make it affordable to come back, and try something new often.
- Cozy little restaurant that's not pretentious or fake. 
- Really friendly and helpful staff that are great with suggestions.

Cons:
- I reaaallly wish there was a location that didn't share air with the smoky old casino. Blergh. They do a really good job of keeping the restaurant free of the smoke, but still. I don't think I'll ever get over the smoke in vegas casinos.",4

Didn't read the description to see if it was supposed to be duck or only duck skin bao. I had the short-rib grilled cheese and thought the cheddar was too sharp.

It will take a GPS to find them if you are a traveler.  They casino was not very noticeable with brown camouflage color and a rear entrance.  Fat Choy did not stands for a fat Chinese guy named ""Choy"" found this place, it translates to ""Getting Rich"" in Chinese.

Since they called themselves fusion, we got things from the two world...  Pork Belly Bao, Peking Duck Bao, and a Fat Choy Burger.  The baos were excellent, I think I like the pork belly one much better.  The peking duck one was good in general, but it just reminds me of the false peking duck dish that used the wrong bread.  Burger was great, and the egg really enhanced the overall flavor.

I failed to see how anyone could hate the drink selections, they got a freestyle coke machine here, I wish it is a self-serve instead of having to wait for the server, and it was a bit inconvenience to ask them to switch up the flavor every time they refill my cup.

After checking Yelp, I was surprised to see that many of my Yelp Elite friends have already visited this place and have given them top notch reviews. I really trust the opinions of my Yelp comrades, so I knew I was going to love this place. 

I was surprised to find that this place was located in the middle of a run down casino called Eureka. Walking through the casino, I thought I was going to have a disappointing time. When we entered the diner, my spirits lifted. Nice read diner booth seating, bar tops and tables were ample for all sorts of parties. Our server was very thorough. When she carded us for the alcohol ordered, she asked us questions about our ID's. It was different, but appreciated. She also went through some kind of spiel about the place, but talked so fast, I wasn't able to catch what she was saying. 

For our meals, I decided to get the two recommended items: Peking Duck Bao and The Pork Belly Bao for $7 each. HOLY EVERYTHING THAT IS HOLY! These baos blew me away and really surprised me. The Peking Duck Bao: duck in an open faced steamed bun, cucumbers, scallions and hoisin sauce. The duck was perfectly cooked and flavored nicely. The cucumber and scallion brought a nice crunchy element and the hoisin brought a nice BBQ sweet flavor. What an AH-MAZE-ING dish. What's more amazing was the Pork Belly Bao: Fried pork belly, pickled mustard greens, cilantro and crushed peanuts. The belly was marbleized and perfectly fried. The peanuts helped to break up the marbleized meat. The cilantro and greens helped to bring an herb and very slightly bitter element. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THESE BAOS FOREVER AND EVER! 

WOW, what an awesome culinary experience. I was more surprise that this gem of a place was located in an older casino building. It truly is your treasure to find. I'm definitely coming back. VERY SOON.",5

Pork belly had a nice flavor and the bun was fluffy. Potstickers greasy and the pork inside was very bland. Sesame noodles were light and well cooked. Short rib rice came with two small pieces of short ribs and no sauce so this dish tasted unfinished to me. The teriyaki chicken rice tasted Americanized and the sauce did not taste house made and was bland. On the menu it stated the chicken teriyaki rice came with market vegetables and the short rib rice came with mustard greens. Both actually came with a side salad which was not listed any where on the menu and it made up half the dish. I told the waitress and she said that's how we do things here and the chef thinks it goes better with the side salad instead of the vegetables. I found this response to be odd when the menu said nothing about either item including a side salad. 

The food here is just ordinary, the diner setting is confusing, and Asian & American food is not a combination that works.",2

The decor of this place is like a diner.  If I blind folded you, sat you down at the table, and removed the blindfold, you'd be ready to order an omelet with an extra side of bacon and sausage.  

Fat Choy describes itself as Asian-American fare; it has very traditional Asian foods on the menu and then it throws in very traditional American fare such as burgers and chicken wings.  I really don't get this ""synergy"" if any, but whatever, it's not a plus or a minus really.  Maybe you want to get some bao and you can convince your friend to come for the burgers and wings.

We ordered the pork belly bao, the shortrib rice, chicken teriyaki rice, and 2 orders of Grandma's Potstickers.

Pork Belly Bao:

The wrap itself was good, the flavor of the pork belly was great, but the pork belly was dry as it was a bit overcooked.  Overall it was decent, but not great.

Shortrib rice, and chicken teriyaki rice:

I lumped these together because they both had similarities, although the styles are supposed to be totally different.  The similarity here is that they both came with a salad with balsamic vinegar WITHIN the dish.  Wtf, this does NOT go with the flavors of either dish at all, and a salad wasn't mentioned on the menu for either dish.  If I had known it came like that, I would have ask for it on the side.  No veggies were mentioned for the shortrib rice, and market vegetables were mentioned for the chicken teriyaki rice.  The shortrib itself was actually really good, but the rest of the dish was mediocre.

Grandma's Potstickers:

Nice pan fried crust.  Definitely a fan of that.  But the filling?  Yo, if my grandma came out with this I'd tell her to get back in the kitchen and work on the damn recipe because yo, where's the flavor?  Kidding, my grandma would slap the dumpling outta my mouth and make me wash the dishes afterwards.  But seriously though, very disappointed in the filling as this dish was hyped up and it was only OKAY.

All in all, this place gets three stars because the dishes are just okay, and the prices are commensurate with what you get in my opinion.  Would I come back by myself?  Nah.  But if a friend wanted to try it out anyways after I tell them how mediocre it is, meh, sure why not, might as well try out the American side of the menu.",3

Fat Choys Chicken with rice is their version of a Teriyaki bowl also yum. Washed it all down with a cold Lucky Buddha beer. Fun, clean Chinese American diner with amazing food. Easy carefree place with good food, you just gotta hold you breath and make it through the smoke in the casino. Good thing you can book it straight from the front door to the Resturant in 5 seconds. Specials like the soft shell crab bao, fat belly BLT and the Fried Pork noodles are only offered for a limited time and you can get notices when by following them on Twitter and or Facebook.",5

ONE WORD: Memorable 

Still one of the best Pork Belly Baos I have every tasted in my LIFE*, I dream about this because it's sOOo good it makes me want to eat more. I can't describe it. It's crispy on the outside and the pork fat is so flavorful bursting with unimaginable bliss of joy with every bite . The amount of dedication invested in the preparation of this pork belly speaks for itself. Fat Choy really hits the spot when it comes to perfecting their boas. You can tell there was a lot of work put into the pork belly alone to make its so flavorful.  Coming from the San Gabriel Valley area, a place known for one of the best asian cuisines in California, I can say nobody can beat what they have here. I'm a food junkie and chef myself the boas definitely hits my weak spot transitioning from vegetarian to a slow transition to meat. I highly recommend this place because of the heart and soul poured into their dishes. I can definitely taste it with every bite. 


RECOMMENDATION: REWARDING*****

1. Pork Belly Bao (5++++++++/5) BEST Pork Belly Bao I have ever tasted in my LIFE
2. Tofu Bao (5+/5), BEST option for Vegetarian Eaters",5

My favorite was the pork bao. Atmosphere was a modest and comfortable diner, which can be a nice change in over the top Las Vegas. They had roasted marrow on the specials but we are saving that for another visit. This place is worth a short trip from the strip.",4
1411091,PqgOonOVfMAHmypYIW0jpA,Kxp8cIMt3-vxwtCSsL9QKQ,Fat Choy is highly recommended by me.  Went here last friday and I almost missed the restaurant. I didn't realize at first that it's located in the Eureka casino.  Small dining area. Ordered the fat Choy burger and pork belly bao. Both totally worth the price at $7 for the bao and I got the same amount as I did at Ramsey's burger for nearly half the price.  Next time I will try the duck bao. Really can't recommend this enough at the price.,4
1411092,UNhDMKFMNhsMPT5_CWoeuw,Kxp8cIMt3-vxwtCSsL9QKQ,"I'm a bao that life.

In a city that loves a good bao. The Pork Belly Bao ($7 for 2) is a solid option - It has pickled mustard greens, cilantro, crushed peanuts, and hoisen sauce. The only gripe I had, was that some parts of the pork belly was too tough and dry to get my teeth into. Other than that, it was a tasty bao and the best thing I ate here. Flavor rating: 4/5

We also tried the duck rice - It comes with a crispy duck leg (not so crispy), cucumber salad (basic spring mix with a light soy sauce dressing?), fried shallot, and ginger scallion sauce (the best part!) for $12, we also added a sunny fried egg (their egg needed work - it was too slimy) for an extra $2. The duck rice wasn't too shabby, but I think it was missing something; It tasted rather dull. Then it dawned on us, you need to eat it with the ginger scallion sauce it comes with (by the tablespoons), in order to wake the dish up and give it some character. The overall dish reminded me of Hainan chicken and rice, but with duck. Awesome concept, but it didn't blow me or my tastebuds away. Flavor rating: 3/5

The sesame noodles ($8) were a big fat NO. The entire dish was terribly bland and tasted like it came straight from the market's prepackaged and refrigerated isle. The menu advertised roasted wild mushrooms, yet we see sautéed cremini and canned straw mushrooms (from biglots?) Don't get me wrong, I love canned straw mushrooms (I'm asian, I know all about it and use it in my cooking.) But the ones used in this dish, were like a weird-tasteless-knockoff brand. To top it off, I didn't taste ""roasted,"" let alone any of the ""wild mushroom"" earthiness or nuttiness in the dish - this was the reason I ordered this dish and it was all a major lie. Also, the peanut sesame vinaigrette needs work, lots of it; It was not flavorful or exotic, it was uninteresting and weak. I was extremely turned off by this lackluster dish and after the second bite, I refused to eat any more. Flavor rating: 1/5

Would I come back? There's a 50% chance. There are many restaurants in Vegas offering a good ol' bao nowadays (BURGR, Bachi Burger, Jinya Ramen Bar) and there is nothing that makes the bao here stand above the rest. Although, I might return to give their burgers a shot.",3
1411093,iDpzCcfU_I77Iwy4YHJrFg,Kxp8cIMt3-vxwtCSsL9QKQ,"I would come back just for the pork belly bao! It was amazing. The pork belly was tender, the sauce was flavorful, and the bao (bun) was soft and fluffy. I also had the Peking duck bao, potstickers, and sesame noodles, but those were only ok. The rest of the menu looked pretty average also. But the pork belly bao was definitely the star.

It's a little hard to find if you haven't been before. It's located inside the Eureka Casino off the strip, so don't be confused at where your gps is directing you.",5
1411094,meGVE53Hab-BmcGFbuTvSA,Kxp8cIMt3-vxwtCSsL9QKQ,"If you are in Vegas anytime, you will have to check this place out. A little off the strip. Located inside a casino. The location at night time looks a little sketchy, but trust me, well worth it. Delicious little gem in Vegas. The burger is one of the best burgers I have had, and I have had a lot of burgers. Just very flavorful. And the staff is awesome, very accommodating! I remember we tried helping the waitress move the tables to fit out party and she insisted she do it. Unless we wanted to take her job she stated. LoL. Awesome!",5

1) tried the duck confit, was a bit disappointed. wasn't bad, but not especially good either. basic duck quarter leg, over jasmine rice

2) pork belly BLT was pretty good for lunch, do recommend ordering if they have

3) teriyaki chicken was basic chicken bowl....done right, but again really can't mess this one up

4) Fat Choy Burger....probably the one reason to return. Pretty tasty burger with great toppings....short rib and fired egg! Great deal at about 10 bucks. worth the mess!",3
1411096,VPIUEiWFQCpKBRvu5cluAg,Kxp8cIMt3-vxwtCSsL9QKQ,"Fat Choy is a gem hidden in the back of a tiny casino on  E. Sahara, the Eureka, a less than desirable or safe area.  The service and food make up for the lack of ambiance.  Don't get me wrong - the restaurant is clean and the seating is comfortable and casual.  I'm afraid people could be somewhat turned off by the location, but if you want delicious Asian/American comfort fusion head over ASAP.

My husband and I first visited about a year ago.  We always get the pork belly bao ($7), a menu must have.  Thick pan-seared pork belly on soft bao with peanut sauce and pickled greens.  The pork belly is a melt-in-your-mouth crispy delight and the bao are the freshest  I've had. Short rib grilled cheese ($10) is another must have for my hubby.  Generous amounts of tender meat, cheddar cheese and more delicious BREAD.

The other item I was delighted with was the shrimp toast.  A generous portion of shrimp atop a delicate toasty slice of French-ish bread, a tiny fried egg, Chinese sausage, drizzled with aioli.  Much, much different than your Chinese restaurant variety.  Alas, the server told me it wasn't very popular and it is only served as a special now. :(  Same with the bone marrow, not enough orders to keep it around.

Consistently good, fresh, well-cooked food and the friendly and knowledgeable servers keep us coming back.  Recommend for a casual night out with friends, date night and don't forget Sunday brunch. :) Ice cold cheap draft beers (Abita Turbo Dog, Widmer) at the bar! ($2.75)",4

Besides that fact, the food is definitely worth the trip! Although we tried several of the entrees (short rib rice, grilled cheese w/ short ribs), the star is truly the baos. Specifically, the duck and pork belly baos. I've eaten duck baos at Chinese restaurants but the ones at Fat Choy are the best tasting ones I've ever had. The duck piece had a perfect amount of crispy skin/fat and just a splash of hoisin sauce. High quality ingredients prepared in a clean, simple way!",4
1411102,nZpANL1RCePy3D4ehzGP-w,Kxp8cIMt3-vxwtCSsL9QKQ,"The food: we ordered Beef Shortribs with Rice, Sesame Noodles, Chicken Teriyaki, Pork Bao, and Dumplings.  First off when I think of ""short ribs"" I think of bone in ribs. I was a little surprised when I saw something else. The beef short ribs weren't that good. It was nice and soft but it wasn't worth ordering.  The Sesame Noodles was actually good. The only problem with the noodles was that it was way too spicy that we couldn't finish it. The dumplings came with a salty sauce which made it even more salty - not good. The chicken teriyaki was good but nothing special or out of the ordinary compared to basic chicken teriyaki you can order at any other restaurant. The only thing that was good was the Pork Bao. If I would ever come back to this place (which is most likely never) I would only order the Pork Bao.

The service:  LACKING.  We came in a group of 7 and they didn't refill any of our drinks until we were done with our food and ready for the check.  We had to flag the server for refills which was almost dumb because the place is small and it wasn't busy when we were there. 

Overall, the food isn't enough to make up for the pathetic service that was provided to us. Also, beware of the smell of smoke. We didn't know it was inside a casino and all the smoke from the casino goes into the restaurant. For some who are non smokers this was a huge turn off. Never coming back to this place.",2

The food presentation was clean neat and crisp. Service was near the top but not many people there. I had an early dinner. Even the cheap desert was Mangolicious.

The food at Fu is floating around the rankings of P.F. Chang's. Given the choice between the two, I would choose P.F. Chang's though.

The Chinese horoscope themed drinks were good. They were strong for fruity concoctions.

We ordered two types of edamame to snack on while we waited for out order to arrive. One regular with salt and one with a spicy seasoning. The spicy one was pretty good, not too spicy, but flavorful.

We also had the crispy vegetable egg rolls. They were tasty and perfectly fried.

For my main dishes I had the garlic green beans, garlic noodles, and the duck. They were all alright, they could have used a little more flavor. I would still order them all again as is though.

The service was nice as well. Someone at our table didn't quite understand the complexities of the lazy Susan and ended up spilling a glass of water into my duck. They staff immediately cleaned it up and brought a new plate of duck.

I had the duck with plum sauce--greasy with mushy skin (should be crispy).  Plum sauce was essentially flavorless duck sauce (not sauce for duck, but that sweet apricot sauce that comes in those little packets).  Served with stale rice without any aromatics.  Heck, minute rice has more flavor.  

If the food was even 1/2 as good as frozen Chinese food from my grocery store, then the price would still be too high.  

Only plus was that our server was friendly.

Usually when you enter, the restaurant is pretty empty but the quality of the food is there. Definitely similar to a PF Chang's (not that I've tried but from friends who have) and prices could be a little steep or standard for hotel dining. 

Lunch Specials, comes with soup, side or rice and couple pieces of Chinese Broccoli 
--- $9.99 I believe and I would recommend the General's Chicken(it's technically better Orange Chicken from Panda Express with more sauce and a bit more spicy flavor). Kung Pao Chicken and Mongolian Beef are also available. 

The Miso Glazed Sea Bass is also nomz 
-- a bit pricey, $27 but it is delicious. 

General's Chicken
-- about $15-$17 for dinner, entree items are along this price range too

Garlic Noodles
-- $9, very simple dish that comes with no veggies except chopped green onions... but it's absolutely one of my faves

Wonton Noodle Soup
-- around $10 to $12, a bit pricer but pretty good - similar to ones at Chinese Noodle Cafes

Skip the HK style Fried Noodles, Beef Hor Fun, Spicy Sichuan Beef Noodle Soup and Potstickers though

First of all, whenever I walk in to a restaurant, I would like to at least be greeted by somebody - or even a sign saying to please seat yourself. I stood around looking for someone for a good minute or two before one of the guys working the grill informed me that it's self seating. I proceeded to find a table, and then go to the bar to make my first selections. While there was a ton of things to add to my meal, there was nothing to put anything in. Quite confused at this point, I returned to the helpful wok-master, who explained that a waitress would bring me bowls and my drinks. This is the first I had heard of the phantom waitress, so I went back to the table to wait. When she finally arrived, I was able to at long last partake of the wonderful bounty. 

The food was everything I had wanted and more! Ever bite packed with flavor from their assortment of seasoning. The food wiped the lack of attention from my server completely from my mind - that is, of course, until I needed another bowl. I had the same issue getting my check at the end of the meal.

We ordered pan fried potstickers...they were more like deep fried...very greasy and not good.  We also ordered General Tso chicken extra spicy.   This barely tasted hot and it was listed on the ticket as extra spicy.  Did they run out of peppers?  The most disturbing dish was the chicken Lo Mein.  The chicken was just as low grade you could find.  The noodles were limp and sooooo greasy.  Ended up throwing that away.

Chopstix doesn't cheat you out of quality or quantity like many other places charging the same prices... They don't add an unnecessary amount of celery and/or peanuts, and their seafood and meat is of quality worth trying for yourself.

We found this place by just driving down mountain springs dr and decided to try it out. It was rather empty for lunch time frame with only two tables of customers. The decor is simple with black and red coloring. We were seated after minute or so and were given menus ( or what looked like menus because it was held by tape and literally falling apart) we decided on beef rolls and noodles. It took about 20 minutes for our food to come out which is a bit long because there were not a lot of customers. My food which was the noodles was super salty and super spicy -_-' u guys need to be consistent on taste no? I mean I understand that it has to be spicy but really does it have to be salty too.... The noodles were a bit starchy like it wasn't cooked all the way. The beef rolls were okay except it had a lot of oyster sauce and was missing onions so the taste was off. The place needs some cleaning on the walls of the decorations. There was only one person in the front who serves as the waiter, cashier, and busboy/girl. Which is inefficient cause it will take a while to clean tables and getting to the customers..but overall it's okay",3

The menu is diverse and we started off with the beef noodle soup (yummy broth lean beef)  and followed with a spicy whole shrimp hot pot and ma po tofu. The hot pot and ma po were spicy delish and the portions were so large we could not finish the two entrees. The service was friendly, attentive and I was advised they bring in live fish from San Diego twice a week.

We did notice that a large table of 10 people were being served everything that we had wanted.  We proceeded to wait and wait and wait.  After 20 minutes with absolutely no attention from the waitress my husband asked her about our order and she said it was coming out.  After 10 more minutes we just got up and left.

Service also left much to be desired. They forgot to bring out a dish when the server brought us the check. We mentioned it to him then and rather than take it off our check he said it was coming out. I have never had a restaurant do this before if the food hasn't come out and you've received the check. They always take it off. He told us that it was coming right out by it didn't for another few minutes. I found that pretty ridiculous. With all the great Chinese available in Vegas, I can't say I would come back here for another meal mostly because of the service.",2

They were in the lets try something new mode rather then the normal spots. Yay for another review! I always wanted too try the  soup dumplings (Xiao Long Bao). By far they didn't disappoint! Hands down the best thing had that night. The thought process of soup in dumpling Brilliant concept and one that can't  think of any other asian restaurant that does it. (or least in my experience so far) You might want too let it cool down for short time but not too long cause once losses the heat cold soup dumplings more like sad dumplings. Lol! Once they come out pop whole dumplings in your mouth. All you want is too pop another another another down. It amazing. The soup tasty in itself, ground pork filing just as tasty, and taste of the dumpling outside really comes all together with one shot. They not as big as you think either so don't be scared cause not something nibble at but go for it.

Other things ordered shared family style was walnut shrimp, spicy tofu dish, chinese broccoli, and chicken wings. I enjoyed the spicy tofu had nice little kick too it, lots of tofu, and like the sauce that was in. Walnut shrimp was ok. I like the fact that nice size shrimp fried too perfection tossed with mayo base sauce on the outside. Nothing really made me say wow. Same goes with the broccoli or chicken wings nothing wow about the dishes. Not sure about other dishes. Three things we were going too try that out of that night. After the second sorry out that can always put damper get all hyped looking at the pics on the menu. The menu talk about good size selection.  Although at the same time I think one of the reasons they run out of stuff is too many things on the menu. It is nice when you have pictures of just about every menu item just in case not sure about the dish. It broad range of food too choose from too.

The service was not very good. She never looked too refill our water glasses the whole time. She never asked what we wanted too drink when she first greeted us or sat us down. The worst part is my nieces order two wonton soups. We got everything else ordered except for the soup. We were done with our meal. We were nice earlier ask about the soup (we had too ask they never recognize soup missing). She apologize but still nothing. Sure got three more tables but earlier we were the only ones in the restaurant. One order not realize missing incomplete order??

Came at 9:30 and only a table of 5 ppl were there. Waitress gave us tea and a menu. While we looked over the menu, I saw friends outside the restaurant and talked to them for 10-15 minutes. I figured my co-worker had ordered so, I ran back inside to tell him my order and he said: ""they never came back!""

So, we sat there for another 10 minutes looking at the other table get food and drinks and chat up the waitress. LIKE, REALLLYYYYYYYY!!???!!!!!!

We walked out. That was ridiculous.

While I'm intrigued to try frog again, I'll save that $16 dish for a dine-in visit as it doesn't sound like it will travel well.

Opted for the noodle dish and roll pie, ordered by phone to pick up, was ready when I got there a mere 15 minutes later- interior of restaurant is a bit nicer than I expect, having been to a few places in this plaza already. 

Noodle dish was packed well with the noodles separate from the sauce- assembled myself at home, and though I'm not entirely sure of the components, I was okay with the overall flavor. Lots of cut up meats, what appeared to be beans, and shrimp in a brown gravy sauce. Aroma of sauce didn't initially appeal to me but taste was decent. Not a bad dish but not one I can see myself coming back for.

Beef roll pie was a surprise with fresh herb inside- good mix of flavors and textures, and a good portion size for something I assumed was an appetizer and not an actual dish. Tasting this dish makes me curious about dim sum options here, though I decided against getting the XLB (reviews are mixed and I was not dining in).

Portion price and quality for price are fair ($20 total and enough for 2 meals), décor is nicer and more upscale than expected, paper menu is not in keeping with these other aspects of the restaurant- not cohesive, but not an issue that will prevent me from coming back to try other dishes.",3

And now the food. It was uhmmm... Ok? Im kind of a XLB (juicy pork dumpling) snob. I've had them in LA, china, everywhere. Now I guess for some reason it's hard to replicate or do right but these were not the business. I heard someone tell me that they are just as good as the ones at Din Tai Fung in Arcadia. No. Stop. Not even close. I guess if you've never had them the right way then these might be good? Not sure. But we left without even finishing the dumplings let alone the other food we ordered. And I'm fat. I don't waste food, but this just wasn't worth carrying. At least to us. Put it this way, we left the food there and went straight to get pho after.

The food: it's good, nuff said. There's so many items I wanted to try on their simplified lunch menu but I got my old standbys, the XLBs and the beef roll. 

XLB: Perfect. The skin kept its integrity until you bite into it, then the soup that gushed out was plenty and flavorful. You get 8 baos for $6.95. Score. Best bao in LV, especially for the price. 

Beef Roll: You get TWO rolls for the awesome price of $7.95. Score. The beef was soft and delightful, as the pancake was crunchy and chewy, just the way a beef roll should be. 

There have been a lot of complaints about bad service and long wait times. The shop was nearly empty, on a weekday at 2pm. I had great service from a lone server who could barely speak English. The point-at-menu order method worked well for me, but the bad service could be valid. Consider yourself forewarned.

I love their xiao long bao (dumplings filled with soup and meat) as has everyone I have brought here.  Not quite as good as you can get in Flushing, NY, but still excellent.  And only 6.95 per order. 

The beef roll was pretty standard but good.  I really liked their sweet and sour pork (which I normally don't order but tasted when a friend wanted it).  I also like their pork belly stew when they have it, and their green onion pancake is great if you like it crispy.  We recently tried their Shanghai fried soup buns, and they were pretty good as well, although I would order XLB instead if given the choice.  The XLB is definitely the highlight and often the only thing we order, but I like that I can have other stuff if I want it, and almost everything has been at least good or better.  

There have been times that service has been very slow here, but it is always because the staff is rushing around helping other customers--not a bad attitude or laziness.  Usually, it has not been busy at all when I've gone.  The staff are always friendly here, even when I have walked in with a large group including six kids.

They have some standout dishes like the pork pan friend bun which is excellent, the soup dumplings which are well done and their sweet and spicy pork riblets which is surprisingly tasty.  Many of their other Taiwanese dishes are also good. 

It is one of my most frequent complaints at restaurants that the food is not served hot and fresh. 1900 does an excellent job bringing the food over as soon as it is prepared. 

This is currently my favorite place in town for fresh dumplings.

As any XLB connoisseur would know, you might as well just not eat the XLB if the skin breaks and all the soup is wasted. I mentioned this to the server, and he just said ""yeah... Because they are bigger"". Well duh. 

Anyways, it was good while it lasted. I will be searching out other places to satisfy my XLB cravings. And if I can't find any other good places, I might come back here one day and pray that their XLBs are no longer stuck together.",3
1466813,wKSIq1uxaftcKOn3oRw55Q,kBsvcoIvoK_M2BIs89xKZg,"Tried Liu's based on the Yelp reviews and was very disappointed. The only thing this place has going for it is the price.

The egg drop soup was unrecognizable as such. More like a brown slimy egg containing broth. The Szechuan  beef was also slimy and not very flavorful. There were 6 people in my party and no one enjoyed the food.

I will say that the waitress was polite and accommodating.",2
1466814,N6bKTrwmc_n7xTi-jXxtsA,kBsvcoIvoK_M2BIs89xKZg,"Normally come during lunch and get the lunch special $5.75 - $6.75 and food is always freshly prepared when you ordered. All the dishes I have tried so far were just delicious. Especially the fried rice, they made it when you order so it always taste and smell fresh.

So my wife and I decided to try this place for dinner, and we ordered the family dinner A for 2 people. It includes 2 daily soup (choose Hot & Sour or Egg Drop), 2 Egg Rolls, 2 Crab Rangoon, 2 Pork Fried Rice, 2 entrees. For the entrees we ordered the spicy honey chicken and Chinese sausage with snow peas. They spicy honey chicken was great and the snow peas was fresh and tasty.

People like to talk about portion, but taste to me comes first. With Liu's kitchen, both taste, portion and price are better than many Chinese restaurants in the china town area.",5
1466815,M-G4_DeQ3cTxCPUAshrsnA,kBsvcoIvoK_M2BIs89xKZg,"Even though my husband and I are Chinese, he is not a fan of Chinese food because he eat Chinese food all his entire life. One day he told me that he found this American Chinese restaurant was pretty good, I was surprised to hear that and thinking I must try this place!  The first time I tried it and this restaurant just blowed my mind away :D.

First of all, everything in the restaurant was super clean and well-organized the fact that they only open for six months.  The service was great; server was very friendly and the wait for the food wasn't long at all.  

We went for lunch special and it was the best lunch special that I have so far.  Honestly, I never found one American Chinese restaurant (not even china a go go) would cook their ""lunch special"" fried rice right after you ordered and they did it for all customers in this restaurant when you pay only $5.75!  I was wondering how could they turnover fast enough during lunch time? I talked to the owner, Mr. Liu, he simply said he wanted to keep good quality food, fresh taste so this is how he did it.  Everything I tried it was excellent, no complain at all.  Even though a small item like crab puff, it was so tasty; Mr. Liu was creative to put some veggie in it and made it even better! 

The presentation of the food is good and neat.  You can see how Mr. Liu has put a lot of effort and hard work into this restaurant and I truly applauded his dedication; someone who cares about the quality the food, looks into details and wants you to have a great dining experience overall.  

He also has a great business partner who manage the front.  Even though they work seven days a week, they still talk to you with smiles on their faces and patiently explain how they prepare their dishes and operate their business.  You can see their passion for their business; it truly shows that this is America, u can reach your dream when you work hard enough.  

I hope that this restaurant would never closed down, serviously.",5
1466816,eDtdYOwA6OdwLXLAQIWCaw,kBsvcoIvoK_M2BIs89xKZg,"This is my 3rd time ordering take out here, the first time we ordered a family dinner with 2 entrees, rice, soup and added an order of chow mein.  At first we thought we found our new neighborhood Chinese Restaraunt (which I've been looking for a while now) and had no complaints.  Close to home, cheap prices, nice employees...then we ordered the 2nd time, this time we ordered chow mein, won ton soup and shui mai.  This time, the food seemed to be forgettable because when I came back again today I really didn't remember if I liked any of it or not last time.  I walked in again tonight to order take out and thought, what the hell, I'm craving soup and dim sum, so I placed an order of each.  When I got home and started eating, it all came back to me.  I didn't like the won ton soup last time since there was barely any meat in the won ton, it was more like floating pieces of won ton wrapper and guessing if that piece had any meat in it.  When I actually did find meat, it tasted a little off, I could be wrong but I was expecting pork won tons where these tasted like ground beef won tons.  Next I take a bite of the pork/shrimp Shui Mai and had to quickly spit it out...sad to say, I don't think they were cooked all the way, I ripped open all the dumplings and every single one of them seemed to be a little undercooked.  I was done after that.",1
1466817,AhDoEiNS8fMLu47Sj1INWw,kBsvcoIvoK_M2BIs89xKZg,"To say I'm disappointed would be an understatement.  After finding Liu's via Yelp I was excited to order from them.  We ordered takeout yesterday (a Thursday around 6:30pm). The pictures looked appetizing, they have a solid four stars, and the prices seemed reasonable.  We ordered the potstickers, crab rangoons, spicy honey chicken and BBQ pork with black bean sauce.  

When we got home and saw the food, at first we couldn't tell which entree was which.  They were both loaded with onions and peppers, I mean LOADED. Easily half of the entrees were filler vegetables.  I expect some in most dishes, but this was like they ran out of protein and had to make the container full.  The flavor of the dishes was generic, but if I hadn't seen a few jalapeños in my honey chicken I would have thought I had received the wrong order, not any honey flavor to me, just salty soy... Certainly not the flavor I was looking for.  The crab rangoons didn't even have a tablespoon of bland filling in each, they were actually indented on the bottom instead of the plump pockets I'm accustomed to.  

We will be trying another place for sure, and would not recommend this place",1

1466820,t0E2MpMi-WDgG2IqVoK04w,kBsvcoIvoK_M2BIs89xKZg,"Talk about bang for your buck for lunch special! At first looking at the prices thinking too myself really that cheap. My first thought was like why do I even bother with places like Panda Express when you can get fresh made too order chinese food the same price?? It not as though limited in options on Liu's lunch special menu. I was blown away that at Liu's there is one full page that can choose from. A truly diverse menu too.  You would think or my experience most places see lunch specials limited. Not here they have it broken down too different proteins from chicken, beef, pork, or shrimp. Most of them are your traditional chinese options find at most other restaurants. Also not only does the options start and end with entree. They give you the option of either hour and sour soup or egg drop soup. Even your starch can be steam rice or fried rice. Some of the entrees not your typical ones that plan on checking out on my next visit. 

I ended up ordering the general tso chicken. I felt like it was okay. The chicken will admit was cooked on point. It was nice crispy on the outside and chicken cooked perfection on the inside nice steaming hot. The sauce that were for me did not work. I felt like the sauce was just bottle of sweet and spicy hot sauce get at any asian market shelf. If anything more sweet then anything. The egg roll that comes with all lunch specials was good. I really liked the most was the pot stickers. Talk about HUGE. I got them thinking use too pot stickers being certain size most part eat in one biter or two. At Liu's the pot stickers take two too three bites. Still even oversized. It had nice sear on one side. The pork filling was not only cooked perfectly but had nice taste too it. The dipping sauce was the perfect compliment. You get six pieces per order. Surprise that able too eat everything good thing came too LIu as recovery meal from day of triathlon training. So when it comes too value up and down Liu's for lunch is hidden gem.

The service was excellent, friendly, and love the vibe of small family businesses. I might have order the wrong lunch special but so many more options too try. Just cause had ok lunch I know Liu's has more too offer. The price not doubt plan on coming back trying more of the menu. Once find the Ono one am sure see bump in updated review, Just keeping it real.",3

Along with your lunch portion of any given item, you receive either eggdrop or hot and sour soup as well as a spring roll. Portions are extremely generous.

For a quick lunch on the the go, this is a great spot. I ordered the Szechuan chicken on my visit and although the food is not extraordinary, it is an absolutely solid option. My meal wasn't as spicy as I anticipated, but it was tasty and fresh, which I was impressed by. Given the long list of items on the lunch menu, I anticipate coming back to try more of their offerings.",3

I ordered two items on the menu which were the famous intestine food and the Chinese meat ball.  The Intestine soup came quickly.  The meatball I guess was just taking awhile. So, I sat there.. Waiting.  Waiting. The lady who seemed like she owned the place came by twice to see if I got mine and she yelled to the back.. About the meatball.  Nope. Saw a new table get seated next to me ten minutes later.  They ordered something. Then saw one of the staff member bring over their meatball. I was really annoyed at that.  
Finally I just asked for the check.  Then the lady came by and said ""so you want me to wrap it up for you to go?""  

No. I do not want you to wrap it up for me to go!  You forgot about my dish. She didn't offer any compensation.  No discount for forgetting. Horrible especially when you over look a dish and I only had two. And then you try to sell me to take it home after 25 min sitting and waiting. I had already finished my first dish a while ago and I just sat there.

1477610,-BWuR6ZzzcRDwXNU4I8mxQ,s4Ki8L-zutVJexVSnFlP-Q,"Hell yes!  We loved our dinners and look forward to eating here often in the future.  Glad the decor isn't bleach boring strip mall, and although it's lacking much style, it's comfortable enough to sit with friends and chat the night away.  Friendly service.  Large portions, great for sharing and mixing.

Spicy Basil Fried Rice, Seafood Combo -- Our favorite!  We stayed safe with Spice Level 1 after overhearing another table complain they ordered too hot.  Glad we scaled back; the 1 was perfect.  A little tingle but no pain, and tons of flavor with the herbs and crunchy veg.  Good seafood mix, giant muscles and grilled shrimp, so-so squid.

Yakisoba, Meat Combo -- Pleasantly sweet noodles with lots of veg and meat.  Skip the plain (but moist) thin strips of beef and chicken, just go all shrimp, baby.  I wish there was more cabbage.  (Good line for my tombstone, gotta remember that one.)

Crispy Catfish Salad -- Bizarre at first, since the fish is minced super fine, then fried to an indiscernible crisp ... so we just saw a blanket of brown crunchies and were confused where the ""fish"" went.  But after the lovely server explained it's a different style, we mixed it in with a green apple salad and our faces basically exploded with tart, sweet, spicy crunch.  In fact, we kept spooning the mixture over everything else we ate, because it had a crunch that could not be stopped.  I wouldn't be satisfied with just this plate for dinner, but it's an excellent sharing dish for punching up everything else.

Crab Rangoon -- Unlike any I've had, rolled long and thin in spring roll wrappers.

I'm diggin how this place comes at my usual orders with a different angle.  I also appreciate the Chinese options on the menu, since our group doesn't all love Thai, so everyone leaves happy and stuffed.

Also in love with their roti, since I haven't found roti this good since Flat Top Grille in Chicago.  Shame it's $2.50 each, but I will order saucy things just to have something to dip in these slices of heaven.

If you're a texture-based eater like me, this place is a playground.  :-)

Me and my wife ordered:
Satay Chicken - 5/5
Pad Ze Ew - 5/5
Basil Fried Rice - 5/5
Orange Chicken - 5/5
Mongolian Beef - 3/5

Yes 2 people ordered all that food. The Basil fried rice is a must here! Mongolian Beef was a little overcooked and dry but I still gave this place 5 stars because the owner and chef Sakina is super sweet. My only word of advice is to check water levels. The misses water glass was empty for a long time before waitress refilled it.

I have a stomach cramp from all the food I ate but it's a happy cramp. Go to Sakina; you won't be disappointed!",5

Ordered: 

Chicken satay - delicious peanut sauce to dip in!!

Thai iced tea - always tasty

Chicken basil fried rice - awesome! Highly recommend. 

Panang beef curry - very tasty and flavorful. Creamy and compliments the white rice well.

Pad kee mao with chicken - like drunken noodles - great flavor

Orange chicken - I got this bc I loveeee sesame chicken and this is the closest Thai version of that. It was realllly good. 

I'm well versed in spicy dishes as a desi and the waitress, super friendly and nice staff btw, gave us a spice scale of 1-5. We picked 3 for everything and found it spicier than we anticipated so might go for a 2 next time.

This valley is most fortunate to have so many wonderful Thai restaurants.Many of them are quite genuine. As a matter of easy reference most will say they're from Bangkok. With no exception, cuisine is unique to the regions of that culture. For example Chang Mai is ethnically more Chinese along with being Muslim.  Southern Thailand is also more Muslim.  Majority of country's faith like their King is Buddhism.

Sakina Thai Cuisine serves both Thai and Cantonese Halal (certified) style meaning no pork dishes. Otherwise the seasonings and cooking style is authenticThai. I'm certain Sakina is the only Thai Halal restaurant in the valley. .

Menu is extensive and very reasonably priced. Restaurant is bare of any artworks except for the Islamic plaque above their counter to the kitchen.

Personable and friendly staff helped to make a delicious meal even better. There is no pork on this menu either.
On the 1-5 scale, for me a 2 was just the right amount of heat. The flavors blended perfectly together and the price was more than reasonable. This is my new favorite Thai restaurant. I hope you try it and enjoy it as much as we did.",4

The taste is authentic and presentation is also good. As the previous reviews have said, the lamb skewers are to die for! It's the first time in 7 years here that I finally have a taste of home. Their tofu with preserved egg (appetizer) is great, the garlic, green onion and chilli oil dressing is addictive! The menu doesnt offer too many dishes but from what I have tasted I am very confident to say that their food doesn't disappoint. 
The decor is to be improved, though the posters are very nice. Just the overall ambience doesn't have the VOGUE element to it. Sometimes the kitchen can ve a little slow in keeping up with the orders but we were hungry that time so I'm sure we looked like wolf pack to other people lol. 
For 4 people our bill comes up to be $86 after tax. We had half salted duck, one appetizer, 10 lamb skewers, one order if draft beer (60oz), one main entree, 2 bowls of beef noodles (big bowl). Keep in mind that appetizer and main entree are of a bigger size than their american counterparts, since we share all the dishes we order.

I do feel a bit sorry for the owner tonight though since it was only her in the restaurant taking care of customers. Service was bad, we didnt get water til almost 10 min after we sit down. I think only one person was doing the cooking so everybody had to wait for their order. Appetizer didn't come until after the main entree was served (happened the last time we went there too, PLS appetizer should go first). I went to the counter to pay and the owner suggested ""the tips is normally 15%"" and even done the math for me, trust me when I say I didn't ask for that (maybe she thought I looked hesitant?), and I think that's just rude.  She punched in the numbers on an adding machine and just stapled that to the ordering form. Oh one more thing, the ""15% tip"" she suggested was based on the total AFTER TAX, not the subtotal (which is what's supposed to be), the difference was just $1 and I paid what she suggested, because I didnt feel like arguing with her in front of all the people. It's a very bad move for your business, very cheap move.

The name threw me off didn't realize they're open for full dinner menu at first.  I read a review about the dim sum is frozen. that must have been a vindictive competitor because these owners also own The huge restaurant Orchid Garden on Sahara & Lindell.

The Mushroom Shiu Mai....the mushroom it was served on couldn't be cut!  It acted like rubber.  You put a knife to it and it would retain it's shape once you lifted the knife from it.  I've never seen a mushroom do this.  Needed to make serious effort to cut through it.  I tried a small taste  and had to remove it from my mouth.  

The shrimp dumplings/potsticker seemed old.   The shrimp in the dumpling was mushy and fell apart.  It was not seasoned and was bland.  Took one bite and left the rest.  

The one cart of food they were selling looked old.  The egg rolls did not look like they were made in house.   When asked about some of the other dim sum on the menu the said that was made to order as it doesn't hold well.   Which gave me reason to believe the food on the cart wasn't made right away and looked its age.  

The pork buns were ""OK"" nothing special.  Could use a bit more filling in the buns.  

The Chicken dumplings were average.  They were actually the saving grace of the experience.   Found it odd you had to actually request the standard sauces that are served at normal dim sum places.   We had the hot mustard and the red chili.  Both sauces were good.  

The ice tea was fresh......I wasn't offered a refill or asked if I wanted another drink.

We then ordered the Mongolian Beef lunch special (7.95) which comes with 1 egg roll and a cup of egg drop soup. Usually the entree is spicy hot and I asked to have it toned down a bit. The soup and egg roll were very good and the Mongolian Beef was prepared just the way I requested...not too hot.
Just enough kick to make you sweat a little. All in all it was a nice experience and good food for a reasonable price. The only thing that I noticed that was a bit disturbing were all of the surveillance cameras inside the restaurant  ..about 9 or 10. Kinda strange for such a small dining area.",4

1.  the bean curd skin roll

Note: The bean curd skin roll tasted old- more of the boarder line spoilage taste. 
2. Sticky rice 
     Rate:0 (yes, it's a zero star) 
Note: The sticky rice had too little stuffings.  Most stuffings are pork fat with very little meat.  It has a very mild rotten meat king of sourness taste which is rather unpleasant for me.  

3. Shrimp dumpling

I personally loved my dinner here at Dim Sum Cafe. I love the location! Not on busy Spring Mountain Rd! Finally, a close Dim Sum spot by my place. The servers were really nice, all of them smiling & very helpful.

You pretty much order all the Dim Sum you want on a menu. As hungry as I was, I wish the food came out quicker but I appreciate & love the fact that they cook it & the food is not simply sitting on a cart.

I thought the food was delicious too! Not bland at all & seasoning was just right. I think the bad reviews stems from people having delicious Dim Sum outside of Vegas but think about it, we really don't have an extensive list here in town in the first place. Honestly, I think this place is underrated. The atmosphere was nice, the lighting was bright, ambiance was welcoming, seats were comfortable, the whole place was clean.. & most importantly, the food was not bad at all.

Of course, if you want your food fast, then go to Orchid Garden or something. This is just a place I'd go to when I want good quality & clean Dim Sum without having to travel too far.",4
1485208,sHOUQx68ZEky9v4SpZZYAQ,VnR-KYOHlQX-aFMkaY686Q,"Don't let the name fool you.We order to go/delivery off their Chinese food items all the time.There aren't any really  good Chinese places on the west side. I've been looking for 14 years. This place delivers. Big portions and reasonable prices Their Chop Suey has fresh vegetables nicely cooked Chicken. Pork Fried rice is on point.
Beef and Broccoli are very good. Won Ton soup is a real broth soup not canned. My favorite is the Singapore noodles! Best I've had in a long time. Only negative are the egg rolls. They aren't big but small and too doughy. This is a small enough of a negative to  overlook. We've had enough failed restaurants on the west side. It would be a shame to lose this one because of their name. Give them a try.",4
1485209,ZKely5FZOCoOqBHDD3sE6w,VnR-KYOHlQX-aFMkaY686Q,"Me: Great neighborhood dim sum place. The pork siu mai was so fresh and tasty and juicy. All the dishes we ordered (beef chow fun, har gow, steamed pork bun, baked custard bun, sticky rice in lotus leaf, fries taro dumpling) tasted as it traditionally should but was not as greasy, actually. If come again for dim sum fix in the neighborhood. The selection is pretty good but not as much as a trad tea house. For that I give 4 stars. Also, very reasonably priced. 

Him: The chow fun tastes almost as good as my grandpa's. It's really good. It's kind of weird my mommy speaks Chinese to the waiters. They're from Hong Kong. The pork buns are good and different because the meat is not small and dry but chunky and juicy. I like the siu mai too because it was really meaty and juicy and not fatty. The bathrooms are so clean, I went twice. I faked it the first time to inspect and then the second because I really had to go. The sticky rice could have had more flavor but my favorite sausage (pork wine ""lop cherng"") was in there so that was good. Order the Siu Mai. Gets 4 stars because no carts of food for fast-eating like other dim sum places.",4
1485210,9pzXg8zDIFV0lKc5ytpaMQ,VnR-KYOHlQX-aFMkaY686Q,"I was excited to see a dim sum place in summerlin! The restaurant is pretty big with pleasant decor. I loved the fact that they have pictures on their menu so I no longer have to make up words to let them know what I want. The prices are good, pretty much like any other dim sum restaurant. However, the major difference between this restaurant and your typical dim sum place  is the fact that they do not have the serving cars. You order a la cart and they deliver the items to you table! Overall, a good restaurant to try.",3
1485211,wklXAJGtR0ItAFnEky58ig,VnR-KYOHlQX-aFMkaY686Q,"They have some things to work on, but I'm giving 5 stars because I've never gone to a dim sum place in town that I really wanted to go back to of my own free will. 

First, a little history of my dim sum perspective. Since I was young I've gone to the best dim sum restaurants in San Francisco with my parents, and since coming to Las Vegas we've also tried practically every dim sum joint in town available. Cathay, KJ's in Rio, PingPangPong, Orchid's, Chang's.... The only time I go is when my parents are in town and it's all the same to me. The best communication is in Mandarin or a dialect, otherwise its pointing at things. There are a variety of dishes, lots of shrimp based things, many dishes are very salty, very heavy, very oily. I don't like any of those latter points. 

I'm not saying that Dim Sum Cafe food is bland. Not at all! But in comparison to all the others, it is not so heavy that it makes me want to stop eating after a few tries. It also seems to be less oily and heavy than other places I've tried. 

One big thing I really like is that you can order dim sum any time of the day and they make it to order so its hot and fresh, not on a cart for who knows how long. This does mean it will take a little bit for your food to come out, but it's worth the wait to me. I was initially a little wary since another review said it was a sister of Orchid Garden, who gave me cold dim sum so I never went back. Fortunately, nothing was cold, stale, or old here. The quality seems to be quite good, and everything tastes great. 

There are some Chinese only speaking employees there, but they do their best and mean well. It did take a little while to be noticed and seated, and service seems a little bit slow depending on which server you get. It might be a little bit of language barrier, a little shortage of staff, a little less experience with customer service, but whatever it is a little training or hiring of experienced servers would smooth these bumps quickly. 

For a Saturday night there were not many people there. I don't know if it was the location or that it's still a new place, but I hope they can make the right improvements and stay in business so that I can keep having dim sum that doesn't overwhelm me!",5
1485212,ibvu_Z9VR0UIkqvDQf6s3A,VnR-KYOHlQX-aFMkaY686Q,"This place does not deserve 1 star because the service was great, everyone was nice and pleasant. However, their food was mediocre. I recommend this place to people who enjoy Chinese food with less sodium. However, if you are like me and enjoy food with flavor, unfortunately I do not recommend Dim Sum Cafe. The Shrimp Har Gow was flavorless and small. The Combo Fried Rice taste was plain, its meat and seafood lacked flavor. The Pan Fried Chive Dumpling lacked garlic. The Chiu Chow style dumpling, I'm sorry, was disgusting and tasted like throw up. The deep fried Shrimp looked bigger in the photo. FYI the shrimp was the size of a dime. The Honey Walnut Shrimp was okay because the walnuts were coated and crunchy, and the shrimp was pretty good, not over cooked, did not drown in the sweet sauce, and about the size of a half dollar coin. The War Wonton soup was the main reason why I wanted to go to Dim Sum cafe, but I was fairly disappointed. It lacked what the other dishes lacked.....Flavor. Salt, pepper, and soy sauce can only help a little. There was no garlic, herbs, onion, etc...nothing to boost the flavor of their dishes.",2

Started with hot and sour soup, it was probably my favorite part of the meal. Baked pork buns were great, egg rolls were pretty standard, and the chow mein was excellent . I will be back, if anything the hot and sour soup is worth it. They could have had carts, I think it would have been served faster, but the place wasn't that busy so I assume they didn't want to waste food.",5

It's one of my favorite spots in town for dim sum and noodle soups. The dim sum is made fresh instead of sitting on a cart all day. Price can't be beat and service is excellent - it's a great family-owned local business to support. Try the steamed pork dumplings, shrimp hargow, baked cream buns, steamed pork buns and beef udon.

Prices btw $2.50 and $3.50 for most dim sum.  Full Chinese menu available.  Good chicken egg too young, Chinese vegetables and war won ton soup.",3

You're orders are made to order so you have fresh & hot dim sum no matter when  you come in. I wish the baked char sui bao were made to order but that's hard to do, they just weren't that hot.  Our favorite of the night are the har gow, stuffed eggplant & pan fried chive dumplings. My favorite was definitely the pan fried chive dumplings,  they were The best I had since moving heren The place is beautiful & very clean. I appreciate the fact that they have a picture menu do those dim sum virgins in our party were able to see a picture before we ordered. If we had one negative I'd we wish most of the orders had 4 pieces instead of 3. Other than that we highly recommended this restaurant",5

Of course, I immediately went to my Yelp app to check the reviews. It's a relatively new restaurant, but the reviews that I read we're encouraging. I especially liked the quick video clip made by the restaurant emphasizing the freshness of their Dim Sum, because they are made to order vs. sitting on a cart. 

I came here on a Sunday with four other family members at around 11:30 AM. Parking was easy since they have a parking lot. We were greeted and seated immediately. The restaurant interior appeared modern, very spacious and clean. They even had two big flat screen TV's! 

We ordered numerous Dim Sum dishes (including the usual Siu Mai & Har Gow). The dishes came out hot, freshly made and in a timely manner. We all felt that the dishes were delicious. We even had a separate order of Tomato Beef Chow Mein (Hong Kong style-crispy noodles). It was done right & it was flavorful. In talking with our waiter, he told us that they are affiliated with the popular Orchids Garden Restaurant. Even though Dim Sum Cafe is relatively new, I feel that they are worth a try...Check out the photos I posted.",4

The restaurant is open with a lot of seating and the staff is very friendly.

Over all the Dim Sum is great, everything is tasty and we enjoyed the whole experience.",4

1485226,X-BebzDrYpwhYqKD7vuu_g,VnR-KYOHlQX-aFMkaY686Q,"This restaurant is one example of why I can't trust Yelp very much anymore.

If I were to rate this cafe, I'd give it 4.5. And like most users, that .5 stars is merely because they market themselves as dim sum, but does not have the carts to give you the ""full dim sum experience."" But you know what? Who cares if they don't have a bunch of old, middle-aged, rude Chinese women pushing your food around?

Here's the deal Yelpers, it blows my mind that most of the reviews take out so many stars or give this place a bad review because of the lack of carts. Let me inform you guys that this place serves the best dim sum food in all of Vegas (bold statement, but true.) The reason why this restaurant does not cart their food around for you is because they know they aren't located in Chinatown with millions of customers everyday, but they want to preserve the quality of their food, which is why they cook their food fresh for you. I can guarantee you that even the other great dim sum places in Vegas (Cathay House, Chang's) will sometimes microwave your food, or heat up leftovers for you to eat. 

Oh and ""how's the service?"" You might be asking. It is incredible. It may be because I came for a late lunch, but we had the most excellent service ever at any dim sum. Waited a reasonable amount of time to be seated, then had kind service through my whole meal. There are simple key things that waiters and waitresses should do (say ""May I...Please... Thank You..."") I mean very basic things that most restaurants don't accomplish, but it takes you a long way. The waitress was even kind enough to hold the door open on my way out. I won't say to expect these kinds of things at peak hours, but they definitely do put a lot of care into their customers.

TL;DR don't come here if you are looking for cart pushers, come if you want some quality food.",5

We ordered, steamed bbq buns,  siu mai, beef tendon, sticky rice, rolled shrimp, rolled noodles in xo sauce which was super oily, fried rice, Mongolia beef and hot and sour soup. Some dishes were not good and some were. So for me the main dishes are ok, dim sum not so much. Probably not coming back here.",2

All the dim sum we ordered - chicken shu mai, chive dumplings, shrimp stuffed in mushroom, baked BBQ pork buns, Chinese brocolli - came out piping hot and, were quite delicious! We've certainly had better tasting dim sum but we were pleasantly surprised by the quality and taste.  We rarely order Chinese brocolli from the carts because they often are woefully undercooked and barely edible but these were tender and yummy. 

We also ordered the roast duck, which was perfectly crispy, and chicken chow fun, which the kids loved. We are looking forward to trying the other things on the menu as the food tasted more ""authentic"" Chinese than the takeout places we resort to given the lack of options in Summerlin.

Service was attentive, the place was clean and we left feeling very satisfied. Definitely our new go-to place for Chinese food and dim sum in the neighborhood - and they deliver!

Well I think the quality of the food makes up for all of that! Even the beef and broccoli off the regular menu was delish! Everything from the sauce for egg roll to the steamed pork buns and rice noodles was just so tasty. Some yelpers pointed out that most dim sum places have the food out on the cart so long that it's not really fresh and some are probably even microwaved. I totally agree with them and actually really enjoyed the made-to-order freshness of the food. Best Chinese food I've had in a while!",5

The service was ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. From the moment we walked through the door the middle aged man who sat us and waited on us was impolite. It didn't bother me at first. I considered it was due to a language or cultural barrier. Then I saw him interacting with an elderly couple who sat in the booth next to us. He wasn't exactly bubbly with them but he sure treated them with a lot more respect than he did us. The slightly younger gentlemen who looks like he might own the place, also began helping the couple next to us, asking them if he could get them hot sauce, soy sauce, etc. While our cups remained empty and no one ever returned to ask how we were doing or if we would like anything else, even though we kept the menu after our initial order and indicated that we would order more food as we went on. 

The only reason I gave 2 stars is because the food wasn't terrible. It wasn't out of this world. It was... mediocre at best. Had our server returned to our table, I could've had more of a chance to judge the food. But so be it. 

I was really hoping this would would be an amazing place! Another sad example of poor service ruining any potential.",2

I'm a huge fan of good quality food that provides consistent good service. My review is based on delivery only, because I've never actually dined in yet. A great option for those that have had a long night partying and cannot even think of going out for food, or if you're just plain lazy. :)
Har gow, shui mai, fried crab claw, soy sauce chow mein, and Hong Kong pan fried noodles are my favorite choices. The noodle soups are great too, I ordered wonton egg noodle soup with added bbq pork and it hit the spot nicely.
The beef/shrimp rice roll is okay but not great. The other dim sum items are hit or miss so I just don't order them anymore. The rice porridge is very bland, so that is also another item I opt not to order.
With that being said, to each their own. This place has many great items to order. A must try for summerlin patrons! Delivery service is fast, friendly, and very efficient.",4

So it's not the biggest and busiest dim sum place but it was clean the people were nice and the food was GREAT! 

To me when you go eat dim sum you want to experience the whole cart table service and crazy mad house atmosphere of it was your first time having dim sum ok, but if you just want some food and go about your day then this will satisfy your fix. 

It's all about the food anyways and they have very good dim sum. The service was pretty fast and you order exactly what you want and it comes out all at the same time instead of waiting for a cart to come by so you can fight for what's left. 

But here at Dim Sum Cafe you can choose from an awesome menu they have everything and then some just as good as a menu as the busy dim sum places if not better and the prices and portions are perfect. 

All I have to say is that for an off the stripe local neighbor's location it was just the right place for me. You so totally try it because you won't be disappointed.",5

The beef in the teri-bowl had an odd texture but tasted fine with the sauce. overall she really enjoyed it.

I like to get my sweet and sour with the sauce on the side and that wasn't a problem here. Now overall, for someone to say that the food they got here was the best Chinese food they have ever had is a bit of a stretch. I will say though, that this was the best sweet and sour pork I have ever gotten from a strip mall take-out place. Nice bite size pieces of yummy pork goodness wrapped in a light-crunchy fried coating. Just wonderful!

Bottomline: we will go there again. Service was nice and friendly. Clean bathroom. Large portions and good prices.",4
1489167,4qLW5igmNrbdav9bzdpCEg,wzK3QuhmrRrx6D0fRGjRZw,"We were craving Chinese food tonight.  We had a flyer show up in the mail too. They seemed good as far as yelp reviews. we decided to try it out.

7:10pm We pulled in and parked at the store front.  You could see the cook chopping fresh cabbage because he had one of the doors open (screen door was shut). We walked in to be greeted with a friendly welcome. I smiled the girl taking our order read our minds and asked if it was to go. We did the Dinner B for $30 it seemed like a great deal feeds 3-4.  We went with the Wonton Soup, house fried rice, and two orders of sweet & sour chicken.  Also grabbed another order of 6 Crab Rangoon ($5.55) and we had a coupon from the flyer spend $30 get $5 off the bill.

 We asked if they had Duck sauce, it's sweet & tangy sauce usually made of peach or apricot jam, plum jam, Vinegar, soy sauce, ginger & a hint of chili pepper.  It's more of an East Coast thing, BUT THEY HAVE IT!!

  My boyfriend went outside for a quick smoke while I waited. the food was ready in 10 minutes! WOW! She said she put 3 little cups of duck sauce in the bags for us. SWEET! On the way home (10 minutes) the food traveled well, it was driving me nuts with the aroma of deliciousness in the car. MmMm!

We got home they put the sweet & sour off to the side in a container which was nice and very considerate. So it wasn't soggy chicken when we got home. They even poked little vents in the boxes too.

The house fried rice had lots of goodies, BBQ pork, shrimp AND CHICKEN? I was really amazed how much came in the rice. REALLY GOOD. Sweet and Sour Chicken had green pepper, onion & pineapples, super yummy also. Egg rolls were delicious, I dipped them in the duck sauce.  The Crab Rangoons were the freshest ones I've ever had. Lots of flavor and I eat two of them.

It's not East Coast Chinese, but it's VERY close.  First place I've been to that serves Duck Sauce, China One won me over. You can order online but if you're ordering take out I suggest not using the online feature, unless of course you lived around the block.

If you want to have a sit down meal & a PERFECT view of the strip it's kind of a cute date spot.",5

Ordered beef and broccoli, sweet and sour pork, fried rice, won ton soup, egg rolls, and crab rangoons (family dinner B, I believe). 

The crab rangoons and egg rolls were NOT dripping in grease, unlike other Chinese restaurants in the area (lived on this side of town for many years and I've tried them all). The egg rolls were a little bland, but they were fresh and crunchy. The beef and broccoli was a little bland too, but the veggies were VERY fresh. The broccoli was perfect crisp, not soggy. The sweet and sour pork was average, but again,  not greasy like many other restaurants. The friend rice was... Not very fried. The rice was literally still white, I've never had fried rice that didn't look or taste fried. 

All in all, it was pretty good, I wasn't blown away, however was not disappointed either.",4

I was a bit skeptical at first because the previous owner/restaurant was horrible!! But my brother told me about the new owners so I decided to try it out and I'm glad I did. I ordered the beef & broccoli, the spicy wings and the pad Thai. Not only was the food delicious but the service is so sincere and genuine. I definitely recommend this place!",5
1489381,tKpwaW2NZ7cwDBGs5PwOcw,1LVq-vrSkNSD0EIIBLnlSw,"OMG!!!  We are so happy to finally find great Chinese food here in Vegas which is almost unheard of. This has to be the best kept secret in Vegas!

We took a chance on this place and were pleasantly surprised. The first thing you will notice is the extremely kind older lady who is waiting on you. I would adopt her as my grandmother any day! I assume she and her husband own the place? 

The second thing you will notice is that the place is extremely clean and that they advertise and cook all their food without the dangerous ingredient that is banned in most other countries, MSG! Most all Asian restaurants use this dangerous ingredient and it's great to know that someone actually cares about the quality of food they are serving and the health of their patrons.

The third thing you will notice, is that they only have two large tables and three small tables as the majority of their business is take out. However, we elected to dine-in but I'm married. If you're single this may not be the place to take your date as the ambiance is more like you would expect from a take out place than a restaurant. However, if you don't mind simplicity and want great food for great prices this is your place!

We had the Orange chicken and the Pepper Beef. And, let me tell you both were good but the Orange Chicken is the best I have had, even better than the famous Chang's Spicy Chicken at PF Changs. I have never seen such huge chunks of quality white meat with just enough breading. (I would highly recommend getting the Orange chicken with a little spice added to it and you will hit a home run!).

Also, the portions are HUGE. Easily enough to feed one man and one woman. So, an awesome dinner for two for $8 ( two men will need two entrees $16)...where else in Vegas can you pull that off?

The only negative I have is that everything is served in plastic containers. I understand that for take-out, but when I eat in, I would like real dinnerware. However, considering all the other positives, this is a minor negative that we can live with. 

We ate here for the first time yesterday and we are on our way back today for more Orange Chicken:)",5
1489382,G2MbfhizUoy8EfIqBAO0eA,1LVq-vrSkNSD0EIIBLnlSw,"I ordered the Mongolian Beef with fried rice and one egg roll lunch special. When you order a lunch special you have an option of fried rice, steamed rice and a side of egg roll or egg drop soup. It's filling!!!  I can tell you that. 

I was thinking they had Thai tea or something but no! ): i find it weird how they didn't have a drink selection on the menu. They actually have this small fridge and they do carry;
Pepsi 
Diet Coke
Brisk
Gatorade 
7 Up
Orange juice 
Sprite 
Bottle water
Dr. pepper 
All in a can or bottle.

The orange chicken was made well. There was more chicken than breading so that was a nice surprise. I liked the fact that it wasn't mushy at all. Hub also ordered fried rice but he wasn't as excited about it because he's used to the fried rice at pumi express better, but we loved everything else. The woman working was very friendly too:)",4

Super friendly service with the nicest mom running the counter and the son in the kitchen.  What more can you ask for?

1502112,SXUT-VpUziVPr1JEdSZnhA,WrTs9iNJaxWzyi2F5huSkQ,"Sometimes you find restaurants where the people are nice, but clueless. That was our experience at World Noodle. We ate there on 1/1/14 for lunch, and the small place was packed. We ordered and waited, and waited, and waited, and waited. The waitress said only two people were working that day, but still. 

About 45 minutes into our wait, still no appetizer, they started serving tables that had been seated AFTER us. We said something and the waitress was apologetic. 

Another 5-10 minutes went by and the appetizer (pot stickers) and the main courses arrived simultaneously. That was 100% predictable, although the tables that had been seated after us received a proper sequence. My dish, my favorite Thai noodle dish whose spelling escapes me at the moment, was utterly tasteless. I mean nothing. The wife got some kind of curry with broth. The beef was tender but the broth was so salty that it was inedible. Shortly after we ate my stomach started to feel funky. 

The men's room had no paper towels. The women's room had towels but no soap. The two people working were women so you don't want to think about the restaurant not having soap in the restroom.

I am giving the place two stars because the waitress was really apologetic, but to be honest it was a one star experience and the food was not good at all. 

Would not even think about returning.",2

Ordered the beef salad, wasnt bad liked the thinner pho type meat and the flavor was decent wished it was a bit more flavorful though. Next ordered the world noodle soup. The soup was quite sweet for a spicy level 10 which wasnt spicy in the slightest. I did not enjoy the sweetness of it and the peanuts in the soup was over kill. My friend had the tom yum noodle soup, the soup was watery not enough yum for the tum. My mother had the garlic beef, the beef was tender but the flavor just didnt really hit and the beef was in too watery of a sauce. All in all its an okay place. The service was good though so thats a plus.",3
1502118,XmIMpMroL6QYGalimtyzSA,WrTs9iNJaxWzyi2F5huSkQ,"It's a great concept - no more arguing over what kind of asian to get, everybody can have the asian cuisine they want in one place. Unfortunately, execution...not so good. I feel kind of bad leaving 2 stars - I wanted to like this place since the servers and chefs were very sweet. Unfortunately, 3 out of 3 things we ordered were not very good, and it's doubtful that I'll give this place another try. 

Shoyu ramen was bland and pretty tasteless, pad see ew was decent but the sauce was weirdly sweet. I didn't care for the flavor, but my friend who had never had pad see ew anywhere else said it was pretty good. The roast duck soup w/ ramen had a fair amount of boneless roast duck, but like the pad see ew, the flavor of the broth was extremely sweet. The noodles in both soups were also soft and slightly overcooked. 

Other reviews seem overall positive, so maybe we just chose the wrong things to try. I won't be back, but world noodle is maybe worth trying if you research what's good. Another thing to note is that the majority of the pics on yelp are posted by the business, so they're staged, not really user pics. The yelp app doesn't show who posted pics, so I didn't know until I got to the restaurant and saw the same pics printed in their menu. A little misleading...",2

1502121,rOoOuObph1hPwWbjemwRiw,WrTs9iNJaxWzyi2F5huSkQ,"I went here on Sunday night with some friends around 7 pm. Only one other party in the restaurant.  The decor was decent, nothing too memorable, but at least there was some decor and it was clean.  The waitress was very nice and we were promptly seated and she took our drink order immediately. I asked her what she recommended overall and she said the miso ramen, shoyu ramen and beef stew. I think it was beef stew, I can't remember the name, but it was the on the right side bottom of the menu on the noodle page... 

I tried the miso ramen. I didn't particularly care for it, I am used to the tonkotsu broth and I think that this was just miso based. I thought the broth lacked flavor and the noodles they used were instant. Which would make sense as that is what they were advertised on the wall. Not impressed with the use of instant noodles. 

Also, had the takoyaki - I admit I have a high standard for takoyaki as I grew up eating it in Japan. This did not fit the bill, but was a good effort, there was one small piece of octopus in the middle. I am pretty sure they balls were fried and not steamed, nonetheless I enjoyed them as it has been too long since I have had any. 

Everyone else seemed to be happy with their choices and the server refilled my husband's countless ice teas without complaint.",3

The selection here is overwhelming - soup noodle from just about every Asian country and to boot they offer Shabu Shabu. Playing it safe I ordered the Thai soup noodles medium spicy with flat noodles. My soup noodles were yummy - the broth was spicy & contained generous amounts of protein and noodles. As I enjoyed my meal in came four new clients  which confirmed what my taste buds were telling me - that this place is legit.

Noodles!

You can get reasonably priced noodle dishes from almost every region of Asia. 

Craving Japanese ton kotsu ramen? Yeah they have it. Korean budae jiggae? Check. Thai khao soi & pad see yew? Yep. 

Look. You can probably get slightly better versions of the various dishes in restaurants specializing in only one of the regional cuisines. Ton kotsu ramen, I'm looking at you *monta ramen* *cough*.

Thought I wanna had just a cup of noodle and back to the hotel BUT it turned out a big dinner. All foods I order were good to excellent. I recommend Thai dumpling, squid and noodle. They are soooo great. This wont disappoint you. Also greay service too.",5
1502125,8X8k1pwnwsuUZGZmIbXSPA,WrTs9iNJaxWzyi2F5huSkQ,"I wanted to give this place 4 stars, but.... This is a new business, and the lady who served us was nice enough that I want them to do well.  However, World Noodle really had nothing extraordinary, or even competitive, to offer! 

They are more of a Thai/Chinese fusion cuisine, which seems to be the next big thing nowadays.  They had these Thai dumplings, wrapped in cooked mochis with either taro, chives or bamboos.  We tried all three prepared fried, and they were good to try if you like cooked mochi and these somewhat authentic dishes.  

I had their special noodle (I can't remember the name now;  I think it was the World Noodle?), and it was decent.  It was exactly how I had expected it but a bit sweeter than I thought it should be.  The bf ordered the duck noodle, and it was much sweeter than what we thought it should be since the soup was more of a soy sauce base.  

To make it a bit more harder to give it more stars than I want to, we were the only patrons there when we arrived a little past five.  We were still the only patrons there when we left 40 minutes later.  

Like I said, if you're looking to venture into a new restaurant for the sake of going to a new restaurant, by all means, go grab a bowl of noodle at World Noodle.  But if you're in the mood for some comfort-food noodle, World Noodle may not be for you...",3
1502126,fadFhfE-0EbXyli8t0_DnQ,WrTs9iNJaxWzyi2F5huSkQ,"I really wanted to give World Noodle more stars but I just can't come around to do it.  It is kinda like its predecessor Anime Noodle, not bad but not amazing either.  What is it...the location??  I just wasn't overall super impressed for what the place is supposed to be.

We came on a super busy Friday night on a weekend where it was around Chinese New Year.  There was no parking AT ALL in the mall where World Noodle is located so we had to park in the mall right next door.  Only problem was, security was there that night to tell us if we didn't purchase anything from the mall, our car could be towed!  WTH?  Many people were doing the same thing by the way.  So we quickly went to Mr. Sandwich and purchased a #1 House Special sandwich to go.  Almost $4 later and a receipt to show the security guard we walked back over to World Noodle.

I'm not gonna say this was an omen but when we walked in to World Noodle, it was darn near a ghost town.  Only 3-4 tables were taken with patrons, the rest were empty.  This is just coming from outside now...where Sushi Kaya next door had a waiting line outside, and the restaurants upstairs were full of patrons.  What gives?  I swear it is the location of any restaurant that sets up shop here in this corner.  Bad news.

We are greeted and seated promptly then shown to a table.  The menus are very nice, I'll give World Noodle that.  Very bright, easy to read, colorful, and with pictures!  We wanted to visit because we heard the Big Kahuna here (Chef Amy) is a very good and well known Thai chef.  This is supposed to be her baby.

After getting our drinks we get around to ordering.  The little one got a regular order or Crispy Chicken ($8.50), and the wifey got the Beef Chow Fun ($7.95?).  I ended up getting the special Mini Noodle Hot Pot ($10.99) because of the flyer on the table.  I chose the Tom Yum soup with beef, and ramen noodles.  

Within 15 minutes our food started to come out from the kitchen.  I try to be more portion-controlled now-a-days but...it seemed like so little food!  That was my main gripe.  The portion of Crispy Chicken was like one row of a small chicken breast or thigh, barely enough to feed my growing 11 year old.  It tasted good and well flavored, but looking at the chicken on the inside, seemed like it was pounded pretty flat before frying.  My kid ended up still hungry and sharing our food.  The wifey's Beef Chow Fun was just how I like it, with green onions and bean sprouts.  But again, the portion was on the small side!  Luckily my wife was willing to share, it tasted good.  My Mini Noodle Hot Pot was just that, mini.  The picture makes it look bigger, but trust me, it's mini!  So yes, World Noodle is right on that one.  This hot pot is great for maybe one little person, but a guy like me, I'm looking for a bit more substance.  Bad thing is, it was good!  The Tom Yum soup was super spicy (which I didn't mind but my kid did), and the thin beef cooked well in the broth along with the other included goodies like the cabbage and enoki mushrooms.  The ramen was good in the soup, but again...so little to go around!  It was a small portion of ramen.  I wish I could have had more to begin with, but I was a bit ashamed to ask, nor was I offered it.  By the time I was done, I had so much leftover Tom Yum soup boiling away in my mini hot pot with nothing else to put in.  Such a shame.  So, so sad.  

Tasty food was a plus.  Tiny portions was a minus.  But service was prompt and very friendly, no complaints there.  Price for what you get would be more reasonable if the portions were just a bit bigger.  On our way out we were envious of all the folks in Kaya Sushi doing AYCE sushi!  Damn buggers!  So we did leave still a bit hungry.  Luckily I had that #1 House Special sandwich from Mr. Sandwich waiting for me.  Just me.",3

We come in and there are three other tables seated, both have obviously been there for a while and have all been served. We sit down order our food (all we wanted was some dessert and my friend told me how much she LOVED their fried green tea ice cream, so why not.) I'm not entirely sure how long it takes to make fried ice cream, but it took at least 25 minutes to get the food. 

When we finished we sat at our table for half an hour (and by now the entire shop was EMPTY). Not once were we asked if we needed more water or how we were doing, nothing. While we wait the two waitresses went between going into the back room and texting on their phones. Till finally we got our bill and we could leave.

By the time we're half way across town we realize that they didn't hand back my friends debit card when the bill was given to us. When we returned to the restaurant they give her back her card without asking for ID or any proof that it was her card. 

I can't say I was impressed but I can say I regret not walking out after eating the ice cream.",2

Ordered noodle dish.  Duck was shredded.  Not like picture.  Ordered ramen vs rice noodle.  Charged extra dollar for that.

Soup was so bad, we could only eat half of our order because the soup was too strong.  Chef/server had the nerve to ask us if we had duck noodle before.  They knew we were from Hawaii.  Who doesnt eat duck noodle in Hawaii!

Dont recommend.",1

We were in line at 99 Ranch and the guy was like ""try Noodle World""

With the help of Yelp, we located World Noodle, we didn't care if it wasn't the place that was originally suggested and we sat down to order.

I'm a fan of these thai fusion menus ... side order fiend as well ;) 

For a group of 8 we ordered a bunch of different dishes ... so let this be a review on what we ordered:

some of the side dishes we ordered we're okay but i would say $5 for 2 pieces of roti is overpriced. 

The soups were very tasty and piping hot.

I chose the spicy basil and enjoyed it ...

The waitress was very courteous and patient when we asked her to split the bill.. Of course, napkins and utensils didn't appear until a bit before our food arrived but i'm not complaining. 

Overall the service was okay, food was very good and the variety was pretty decent. I mean if I lived in Vegas and had to choose where to eat, I'd drag them to World Noodle every once in awhile. The prices overall for different dishes were very fair.",4

The service was great, I ordered the Thai Boat Noodle for the first time which was recommend by the waitress. It seems to be more of a Thai restaurant so I didn't want to order anything else. My food came out and it was decent. It reminded me of a spicy thick broth beef pho. It was pretty good until I bit into a huge chunk of liver which was my fault for forgetting to tell them to order without. Would come back again",3

Their papaya salad, beef salad, and the rice & chicken dish were delicious as well! The rice and chicken dish may be bland, but if you ask for the ginger fish sauce with hot peppers, it serves as a perfect dipping sauce for it.

Spiciness level is on a 1-10 scale, with 1 being no spice and 10 being very spicy.

I noticed that they serve ramen and some sort of Korean soup stew dish. In my opinion, I think it's best to stick to the South East Asian soups since it seems like their Thai owned. Just a thought.",4

This place is garbage. If I could give it zero stars, I would. 

First off, TERRIBLE customer service. We were literally the only people in the place, and the waitress was bumbling about in such a rush she didn't even take a our drink order. She just brought us both water (which neither of us wanted). Also didn't ask what level of spiciness we wanted our food to be, they asked that every time we came in before and she seemed irritated when I reminded her. She was unhappy and angry we were there.

We both got the Singapore Noodle, which ""vegetables"" consisted of a lot of onions and just a few slices of peppers. How cheap. Cheap as in low quality food. The prices are anything but. A handful of salad in a sauce bowl is $5.00.

As we reached the end of our meal, I had a whole half of my meal left on my plate, my boyfriend asked, word for word ""a to-go box and the check"". She grabbed up our plates and threw them in the back, in the trash. No mediocre noodles for me to snack on later. Lame. 

This place is just plain BAD and you should invest your money in another one of the great restaurants in the area.",1
1502139,8gjpsZ6QNT4Z991kSKA7fg,WrTs9iNJaxWzyi2F5huSkQ,"Definitely a great place for indecisive people! World Noodle has Asian noodle dishes from around the world and it's perfect when you can't decide if you want thai, japanese, vietnamese, and so on. I've been here a few times and it has not disappointed me yet. The price is just right for the portion and the food is authentic. The first time I came here I was worried that they wouldn't be able to capture the flavors of various cultures; I thought their menu was too diverse and there was no way they could make good Japanese food while making good thai food, but turns out I was wrong. Everything is delicious! My one recommendation to anyone who comes here is to eat the Roti on the appetizer menu, it is my favorite!!! For dinner, I recommend the pad tai, now normally I wouldn't recommend it anywhere else, but here the pad tai is so traditional and there is no other place that makes it like this. Other entrées I recommend are the Drunken Noodles and the Hainan Chicken, both well made dishes. This is a place I will keep coming back to because they exceed in quality and authenticity!",5

They do have vietnamese food and Japanese mixed in, but mostly thai. Not a bad place, just mediocre. But in my opinion, if you want thai, vietnamese, or japanese food, just go to a restaurant that specializes in that kind of food. Oh, thai tea is good, though they serve it in tiny glass and no refill (of course). I don't mind no refill, just not in a tiny glass where I am forced to ask for another glass.",3

Although the appearance from the casino floor is less than inviting (a screen or other barrier would help eliminate the closet look) the food was spectacular. We sat in a booth and quickly felt removed from the casino, although we could still hear the odd mix of music. We ordered the 7 spices calamari for an appetizer. No breading. Rich, melt-in-your-mouth deliciousness. Main dishes: scallop in black bean sauce with broccoli and seafood chow mein with crispy noodles. Both dishes provided perfectly cooked seafood. No rubber eraser scallops here! Service was exceptional, too. We would come back to the Grand hotel just to eat here. Seriously.",4

I would be VERY skeptical of positive yelp reviews of this place.
The food is stunningly bad.
It's nowhere in the same league as Panda Express for instance.
Most of the food was old, and dried out and tasted like bad leftovers.
There's a cluelessness here that is almost incomprehensible.
The dining space was fun and the service was friendly and attentive.

I ordered the steamed tofu and fish. The plate came out hot, but oddly the fish was lukewarm, and the tofu underneath it was cold. The waiter took it back and apparently they just reheated the same dish instead of making it over. As a result, the fish was not as perfectly cooked as when it came out the first time although everything was warmer. Granted, perfectly steamed fish is not an easy thing to do, but if it's on the menu I assume they know what they're doing.  The flavor and quality of fish was good, I just wish the execution was better. 

We also had the pot stickers, lettuce wrap, and a vegetable fried rice. All were good though the number of lettuce leaves were too few.

The service is great. Than, our waiter, was efficient and friendly.

Even my mom was impressed, and she's a picky eater! The service were top notch. Very alert, very accommodating, very friendly!  I'm definitely coming back to dine here!  For 50% off, for any restaurants inside the Downtown Grand, for the month of January?  You can't beat that!  I'd pay regular price for it!  Ignore the negative reviews.

The restaurant is a bit small, but cozy. It's decor has a red and black Asian theme with really simple and modern lighting. 

My coworkers and I went to Red Mansion for lunch on Chinese New Year. I ordered the Kung Pao Chicken lunch special for $10.00. This lunch includes a lunch-size portion of Kung Pao, a side of rice and an egg roll. The chicken was tender, but I found it a but under seasoned. They were generous with the sauce on the dish, but the ratio of veggies vs. chicken left something to be desired. The white rice was fluffy and not dry. And, the egg roll I found to be a bit bland. All in all, the food wasn't memorable. 

I would say though, we were seated quickly and the service was good. Overall, good service experience, but I'm not sure I'd proactively seek this place out again.  Oh, and our meal didn't come with a fortune cookie:-(",3

The dim sum is homemade fresh everyday, which you really can tell because it doesn't look anything like the little frozen nuggets that almost every other place just thaw and fry.

The spicy wonton appetizer is very tasty and unique; I have never had anything like it in any other Chinese restaurant.  It has a special spicy flavor that is perfectly balanced and leaves you wanting more.

We almost never order kung pao chicken in Chinese restaurant because the chicken almost always is overcooked and the other ingredients bland.  That certainly was not the case here.  The beef with little, thin asparagus spears was delicious, with the perfect sear on the beef.  The crispy beef with carrots is so sweet.

For entrees we had the Sichaun Fish with Spicy Garlic Sauce and Peppered Beef with Asparagus.  The Sichaun Fish was amazing.  Never had a fish dish like this before.  Very delicate fish perfectly cooked with a medium spice garlic oil sauce.  The Peppered Beef was a great compliment with the fish.  The beef is very tender and nice crispy asparagus.

It's a quaint room, good for a date or a double date. The red decor and old photos  seemed very boutique, something this casino gets right throughout the entire property. 
The first thing to come out was the spicy won ton soup. I was worried since I am really bad with spicy, but this was actually a delightful tingle that really is enjoyable. It's a flavor you will suddenly crave, trust me.
The next entree was the garlic fried shrimp, it's heavy but so good. If there wasn't for the fact that tons more food was on its way, I would have broke my diet with this dish alone.
The dim sum then followed which is each handcrafted by an artist in the back; his one job is to make these and it's amazing. Recommended for sure!
Quickly following these plates were the crispy beef, Singapore noodles, and general tso's chicken which were all the best Chinese I've had in Vegas yet.

Walking along the strip or even driving by it, you could easily miss it. It's in a marketplace of restaurants and vendors close to Polo Towers and the Travelodge.

After eating finely the two days prior on the Las Vegas Strip, we decided as a group to stroll the marketplace (which was steps away from our hotel --the Polo Towers) and see what we wanted to eat that wouldn't cost a lot, and couldn't drive anyway because none of us could legally do that at the time, if you catch my drift.

There weren't too many patrons inside so service wasn't slow for us. There's a good number of tables and seats here as well as a wall mural of photos depicting food around the world. The 6 of us sat down, ordered food, and received food in a timely fashion. We were out of there in 15mins and didn't feel rushed...except that it was almost time for the Walking Dead episode to come on..

I ordered the miso ramen. I've had better noodles in San Diego but the broth was nice. No MSG present (I'm sensitive to MSG so I'll know), and really satisfies me.

And it continues here.

I have been to some terrible restaurants in my 41 1/2 years. This ranks among the all time worst. Everything everyone else said who gave it one star was absolutely true. The Jumbo Buffet for $5.99 was a downright steal in relation to the $14.99/person for dinner.

In an Chinese restaurant setting, I would hope to have some kind of Chinese or Asian ambiance. Instead you are treated to a large soda sign. Not even Coca-Cola, but the way less inferior brand.

Was hoping they could have worked this out.",1

They have a small dining area, but they can fit a sizable amount of tables for dine in guests. All the servers were really friendly and I was greeted quickly and politely by two when I walked in. One server told me they had only been open two days, so I was pleasantly surprised by how big a crowd of diners they had attracted. 

Their menu is extensive. I noticed soup dumplings and got excited, but since I was doing takeout I knew that was a no-go. Next time for sure. I ended up with the pork and cabbage dumplings and a taro slush with boba. My dumplings came out first and were packaged well to go. I had hoped for some sauces or something, but I just used some stuff I had at home to dip them in. My taro slush wasn't amazing. It was a little on the thick side and too sweet. Not my favorite in town, but they have quite a few flavors, so I'd be interested in trying some of their less conventional flavors. 

I tried some dumplings as soon as I got home and they were good. Lots of meat and pretty flavorful. Not the best I've ever had, but solid and a huge portion for the price. They're a new spot, so I give them the benefit of the doubt and I look forward to trying a few more of their menu items in the future.",4

Ordered the beef noodle soup - the bowl is HUGE,  Enough for two huge (we each ordered one!).  Beef was super tender, lots of noodles and broth was some of the best I've eaten with a wonderful combination of mild, fragrant spices.

We also ordered the lamb, onion and carrot dumplings and green onion pancakes (excellent).  The dumplings take a while to come out, but its because they're hand made using fresh ingredients - worth the wait!!  Perfectly cooked with lots of filling - an order is 14 dumplings, so a lot of food.  I left with a very full stomach and loads of leftovers!  

Lunch (with hot green tea) was $33 and change - amazing price for the quality and amount of food.  They only opened on Tuesday but seem to be doing a brisk business with lots of people coming in for take out (FYI - they have the most extensive smoothie/bubble tea menu I've seen outside of San Francisco Chinatown. Pages of flavor combinations!),  

My friend and I are going to definitely become regulars here!",5
1517649,IN9A0O1OuWx6DJPvICkBKQ,1MRWXUsIvKNwt5SdLxqhZA,"The dumplings are their saving grace. One star for each dumpling I ate. Everything else was pretty bad.
First off, they ran out of plates. What kind of place runs out of plates?! The waitress gave us little plastic dipping cups instead.... which doesn't help.. Secondly, I don't think they train the staff very well because when we asked for napkins, she gave us 3 pieces.. we had 4 people in our party.. I mean, give us a little more. No need to skimp on paper napkins... And third (which was the worst), they ran out of dumplings! We ordered pork & zucchini which came out right away however, she said they were still making the pork & cabbage. We thought it would be maybe a 15-20min wait... but we ended up sitting there for over an hour. If they were out, she could've told us at the very beginning so we could've chosen a different flavor or just skipped it totally. 
The four of us ended up cancelling the pork & cabbage ones since we had to leave. Very disappointing. Lucky for them, their dumplings reminded me of the ones my grandma use to make back at home. The skin is hand rolled and chewy just the way I like it. The dumpling is stuffed to the brim with porky goodness and the juices drip off the skin once you bite into it. Dip the dumpling into some vinegar and hot sauce and you have the perfect dumpling. We also ordered some of the apps such as the chicken wings (skip), popcorn chicken (good), and liang ban fen pi (noodles were too long, difficult to mix with the non-existent peanut sauce). Just stuff yourself with dumpling goodness. 

TIP: Wait a few more weeks for this place to work out some of their kinks before you go or you might not even be able to get the dumplings!",4

Decided to finally try this place out after a day at CES. So what did we order? The dumplings of course! We ordered the pork, chives, and shrimp dumplings -- which are typically the ones I always eat. I decided to skip on any of the appetizers due to Jennifer's review. However, I did order some xiao long baos (steamed pork soup dumplings) because I was curious and I just had to see how they were.

They gave us some spicy and salty peanuts while we waited for our order along with tea and iced water. Then this odd sound came through ...and I'm thinking, ""Is she hand chopping the pork?!"" Whoa, like whoa. It sounds like it. Anywho, the wait wasn't as bad for me .. maybe a 15 minute wait for the food to come out. The dumplings came out piping hot and fresh! There were 16 of them by the way. And the wrappers they used for the dumplings did NOT look like the typical thin store bought wrappers at all! They were thick and chewy just like how I usually prefer them. So it does seem like the dough is made from scratch by them. 

I just couldn't wait and I dip a dumpling into some vinegar and start munching! Juicy, warm goodness in my mouth! The flavors were good. It was a great balance between the pork and the chives. Not too bad, not too shabby, and authentic to the bone. But wait, the vinegar is a little bit too sour for my tastes. I think I prefer red vinegar when it comes to eating dumplings. And also, that's when I noticed that my boyfriend is dripping juices everywhere -- dumpling juices! Where are our plates? Where are the soup spoons? Awkward. We end up asking for soup spoons but decided not to bother with the plates. We were eating them too fast anyways.

As for the xiao long bao's, skip them please. They were small. They were bad. It had this odd taste to the soup in them that I did not like. The meat was fine but their soup was a no go. 

The service was good though. Our teas and ice water were almost always filled. They were quite attentive. Though a warning, all of the servers are mando and/or canto speakers so their second language is English. They may have a heavy Chinese accent and may not thoroughly understand your question. Not sure if that's something that people get turned off about but just a little warning. So just gotta be patient :)

Great dumplings. Gotta be from the dumpling menu! No to the xiao long bao/steamed pork soup dumplings. Pretty nice service. Think I will come again just for dumplings and maybe try their smoothies and/or milk teas to see how they are. 

However, one thing is, CASH ONLY currently. They don't even take your card. They told me that their credit card machine isn't in yet so they can't even accept the payment.",4

I stopped by here after getting some coffee from Lees. Their waitress was very tentative and knows their menu very well. Some of their foods like small dragon bun you have to order first cuz they steam it fresh. I suggest you order one, by the time you're done with your order, its almost done cooking. I ordered their lamb,beef, and pork dumplings, the flavor is definitely different, but I can taste they added some curry flavor to it.

Firstly, upon entering the restaurant we experienced a very unpleasant odor. You get used to it, but it is very worrisome for the future of this establishment. I'd recommend they figure out what's causing it and get it under control.

Secondly, get some control over your service. We experienced some very basic service issues. They were certainly friendly, but you need to give us some plates to eat our food on. They were alllll over the place. I couldn't even tell if the servers were assigned to any particular tables. Some basic training and management would easily take care of that.

But in the end the dumplings we had were pretty good. The little basket dumplings, although good, had no soup in them at all. We will go back to give them another try. We hope that they get it together because they are REALLY close to having something super good.",3

Had the opportunity to check out Fat Dumpling with a large group of friends.  We shared several items, and as a result we were able to try quite a few items from the large menu.  There wasn't anything here that struck me as below average, but there wasn't much that stood out overly positive to me either.  

 My favorite dumpling was lamb based...I think it was a blend with other meats as well though.  It was juicy...bite into it and watch it spray over your plate juicy.  In fact with a little practice you could easily cover those sitting around you with a muttonist mist.  

Additionally, we partook in Chicken Wings, Karaage Chicken, Takoyaki, , Green onion Pancake, and an assortment of other dumplings...again they were all just okay.  

I wouldn't avoid coming here if others were set on it, but I would not seek it out.  They are still new though...maybe things get better.  It was very busy and the staff kept up and was very pleasant.  Everything was very reasonably priced.",3

I wanted to order soda but they said they don't carry soda/juice. Some people doesn't like to drink boba tea with their meal. They like to drink it as a dessert or just a snack. 

Second, I am a bit disappointed that they only have large servings for dumplings. They should at least offer smaller servings so that people who doesn't have that much big of an appetite can try other dumplings too. I would rather get 4 pcs of 5 different dumplings than 1 order of a 14 pc dumpling. 

The atmosphere is great, very nice servers, and clean environment. I'm giving this restaurant 3 stars only because they just opened a few week ago and they're still trying out the waters otherwise, I would have given them 2 stars. I think they can use a lot of improvements with their menu.",3

I ordered the pork, chive, and shrimp dumplings--every order comes with 14 pieces. I kinda wish you could mix up your selections but I guess this makes it easier for the kitchen. 

The server was punctual and attentive.

As for the dumplings, they were yummy but nothing spectacular. When they came out on the table they were still steaming--OHHH YEAAH! I was starving so I started scarfing them down, dipping them in a mix of soy sauce and chili oil then Sriracha.

We ordered family style for the 6 of is except 1 of my girlfriends is a vegetarian so she ordered her own veggie dumplings.

We then proceeded to tell her that they both had meat in it and she was like 'Ohhhh okay.' We were all a bit frustrated because we wanted to wait so we can all eat together.. By the time here came out, our food became cold.

The juicy pork dumplings were not the business and the rest were meh. I've had better at small hole in the wall places in vegas.

First off they can't count but in a good way!  They gave us 2 extras but from the looks of the other reviews maybe it's a good strategy to boost word of mouth.  It's working right here!

The lamb dumplings were really good - not over powering lamb flavor and overall they tasted very comforting and homey.  These aren't blow your mind out of the park dumplings.  But I'm intrigued to come back to try the pork,chive,shrimp dumping along with many of their vegetable dumplings.  

The fried chive was slightly oily but crisp well on one side and heaping with chive and egg. I think I will order this every time.

They were full of flavor and well priced.  The meat was tender and tasty.  I would give it four stars.  The second item was the smoothie.  That was one of the low points.

One of the few dumpling places in Vegas. The place was quite pack when we went in and they had only 2 people working the floor. Normally, restaurants with experienced waiters / waitress should be able to manage a restaurant that size but you can tell that they were inexperienced and forgot to bring us our drinks. 

Food
There are various dumpling selections on the menu. We decided to try the traditional pork and cabbage and a nontraditional beef and onion dumplings. The dumplings were good, nothing extraordinary and can't really compare to the places I've tried in Hong Kong or Taiwan but it was still good nonetheless after I'm a big dumpling fan.

We also had an order of the Green Onion Pancake which tasted like every other green onion pancake, but it was crispy and cooked pretty well.

We had an order of the Beef Noodle Soup. The broth tasted pretty good but the noodle were a bit overcooked. There was an wrong order of beef noodle that they bought out that no one claimed before we ordered and our order came pretty quick after ordering, just assuming they bought us the same order that was return. Anyways the portion size was big, good enough for 3 of us to split a small bowl. Just the noodle wasn't anything special and other Taiwanese places would be more worth the price if you wanted Beef Noodle.


Prices
Dumpling - $8.75 for about 14 dumpling
Beef Noodle - $8.75

Service
The service was not so good, even for a Chinese place. Two people were very nice but seems like they were unorganized and inexperience. Normally a restaurant of that size, even 1 experience person should be able to manage it but they had 2 people that forgot to bring us our drink order (water) and messed up on other peoples orders. A lot of times, it was a lot faster to just stand up and grab a set from the next table then call one of them over.

Overall
The food was ok, It was still a little bit pricey in my opinion for dumpling but it makes sense because restaurant have to make some return. The service wasn't great, you can tell they were really trying but after being open for a while and seeing other yelp review, would have figure they improve their service standards.",3

1517675,t7uBPMU33eI-6IyRqcdRMQ,1MRWXUsIvKNwt5SdLxqhZA,"MY 100th REVIEW!

I'm completely addicted to dumplings right now after having a whole bag of Ling Ling dumplings from Costco for every meal for two weeks... But Fat Dumpling is what started the addiction...

What Fat Dumpling has going for them is that they don't try to be too much. Most of the menu is dominated by the standard style dumplings. You can tell by the taste that these are made in house, and I'm further convinced by how they treat their smoothies.

The first time we went, we were told that the tapioca pearls weren't ready yet (it was around 11 in the morning), and that it would be close to an hour. A little disappointing that they aren't made ahead of time, but considering that some pearls take almost two hours to make, it isn't too surprising. In fact, they do let you have yesterday's pearls if you want, or there's some yummy jelly options. But what convinced me to keep coming back here for their smoothies was that they use fresh fruits and not some substitute like powder or syrup. The prices are reasonable, and the mango smoothie is one of the best I've had and isn't overly sweet as well. Usually I get a large and it's gone by the time I get home :|

Then there's the dumplings - I thought the flavor was good. No sauce is needed here, though you can always have some if you like. I've also tried their popcorn chicken which has a good flavor but might be a tad salty. On the very plus side, the chicken was very moist and had a good amount of meat. I also tried their steamed pork dumplings which had a good flavor in my opinion.

Overall, I simply just enjoy the simplicity, price point, and flavors they offer here. It is probably my favorite local Chinese joint in Las Vegas.",5
1517676,cjvecBNysq5np-hbAAe2dg,1MRWXUsIvKNwt5SdLxqhZA,Wanted to check this new place out and enjoy some dumplings. The drawbacks to the place is they are a little unorganized with their ordering system. I didn't know the take out line and the dine in were two separate things and it took 30 minutes for our order to come out. Also the Chinese chive dumpling had almost all chives and hardly any egg or shrimp. Ordered a green tea and they said they only had one kind even though the menu says otherwise. Noodles were also very sparse with shrimp and vegetables. Three stars for friendly staff and the piping hot egg drop soup,3
1517677,4SDeUnBeuellakhcqHum6w,1MRWXUsIvKNwt5SdLxqhZA,"Came here after getting my massage at Bali Foot Spa. 

Shrimp and chive dumplings : Good. I liked it. Inside was seasoned nicely and the outside was nice and soft like how any fresh made dumpling should be. 

Chinese pancake : Like any other. Slightly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Could use a little more seasoning but I guess the dip makes up for it.

So I ordered 2 pancakes and they ended up putting in only 1 order and a wrong order of squid balls

Squid balls : ok. Actual squid inside. Seasoned ok",3
1517678,YRKpAnKbFdn1iLpDkjkSTg,1MRWXUsIvKNwt5SdLxqhZA,"This is basically a review on one of their smoothies. I haven't tried a dumpling yet. If you don't like that, then read another review.. They have 93 drink options and I think this is a valid thing to look at.

My preferred boba in the area is No. 1 Boba Tea. However, one of my friends recommended Fat Dumpling, and it was literally a short walk from where we had eaten dinner. I was really confused until I actually saw the menu because I'd only heard of the dumplings, but they have pretty much every typical flavor of fruit that you would find in one of these places, including durian.

They proudly display on their menu that they use real fruit. You can see them use real fruit as well. That's a solid plus compared to some other places. I just wish that I had seen Nelson Q.'s review before I made my choice of the avocado smoothie (without toppings) because I definitely would have picked something else.

What I got definitely had the texture of avocado, but definitely less flavor that I would have liked. More importantly, it doesn't seem like they've added any sugar whatsoever. Basically, it was more of a nice textural experience than a flavor experience, and I had to endure it with the small diameter straw that I had selected because of my peculiar avoidance of boba.

I will gladly try a different flavor if I'm ever invited here again. I just can't recommend this place yet based on my personal experience.",3

While I loved being able to snag dumplings to go (don't know of [m]any places to do so), and found pricing to be fair, the giant 14-piece order got a little boring after half the order was done. Would like the option to purchase half an order so I can mix it up with another flavor. Overall, dumplings held up and were tasty. Seemed to be mostly pork and chive with a slight shrimpy flavor, though I did not visibly see any.
Found the squid balls to be underwhelming and bland, despite a sprinkle of seasoning on them- would have appreciated some sort of dipping sauce, but again, it was a decently large portion for the price (8 pieces?).
Lastly, the lamb. Ordered them because it was recommended here on Yelp. Reviews neglected to mention how spicy the lamb is. Found the portion for the price underwhelming, with five or six tiny meat pieces on a mostly bare skewer. 

Overall impression was underwhelming. They need to make some changes if they're going to stay open: at 8PM on a Friday night, I was the only customer. Lee's Sandwiches next door had more business- that's pretty sad.
May come back to try the steamed buns or a smoothie... but reviews here tend to say the food is better than the drinks, which makes me wonder if it's worth a second try.",3
1517682,nqmxvsJMMcGep0BgxrdHvA,1MRWXUsIvKNwt5SdLxqhZA,"Came here for the first time last night and I can already say I will be returning just on their boba and smoothie drinks alone. Their boba was nice and chewy and their smoothies and milk teas are made with real fruit and ingredients. How do I know? The taro wasn't purple! They also have 3 different drink sizes, but I would recommend getting the medium which is the size of a large at other tea shops in Vegas. The large just looks way too big.

I wasn't too hungry and only got 1 order of the pork and celery dumplings, but realized later on that the gave me pork and sauerkraut instead. No wonder it didn't taste like celery! Before I saw the bill I actually thought they had given me pork and cabbage since that's what it tasted like. Pretty good dumplings though. I like that the skin is thick so they don't break apart when you pick them up with your chopsticks. 

They have a lot of appetizer/snack food items I wanted to try like popcorn chicken and green onion pancake so I'll have to get those next time. I like that they're open late until 2 am. Pick up a stamp card to take advantage of the Buy 10 get 1 free drink deal. They also have a $10 credit card minimum so bring cash if you're only doing drinks!",4

I got there and ordered:

1. Fried Chives Dumpling- its HUGE! I thought it would be small so I wanted to order 4, but the guy said it was big so I ended up ordering 2.. good call. Its really good! It was like an asian quesadilla.. lol.

2. General Tso- TSO good (;

3. Popcorn Chicken- okay, i've had a lot of popcorn chicken in my days.. but for some reason.. the seasoning on this chicken is different. Its so addicting.. I ended up eating it all before my boyfriend could even have some! He agrees as well.. theres something about their popcorn chicken that doesn't want you to stop eating it!

4. pork dumplings- it tastes like every pork dumping.. its good, though!

5. chive pancakes- ehh, you can skip on that. its not good unless its fresh!

I ordered all this and they were so fast! We were in and out of there in about 15 mins!

Poor friend's ""Peanut Butter, Banana, & Chocolate"" crazy smoothie really was crazy... so crazy it became ""Banana, Peach, & Pineapple."" Talk about dissociative identity disorder! The server was unsympathetic: ""But you pointed.....""

On the other side of the table, my #86 ""Papaya, Avocado, Strawberry, Banana & Watermelon"" was delicious! Banana always overpowers at first, but when the papaya comes through, you'll be cruising! Next thing you know, you wish you ordered a large.

He skimps on ingredients, gets the menu item number wrong, and adds way too much sugar when specifically asked not to. Also, he made me the wrong drink and didn't even suggest he would correct it for me. Three times I've come and had issues with the way he makes things. Pretty close to not coming back.

Also, they close at midnight instead of 2am now.

I've been here a few times and while it hasn't been consistent most of the time, this is the place where I would frequently visit for my boba needs.

It's a fairly new spot that's been open for a few months. I've gotten turned in this place by the recommendation of some yelper buddies. It's located on spring mountain next to lees sandwiches.

Popcorn chicken - a Taiwanese speciality, the one at fat dumpling is nice and crispy on the outside, and moist and juicy in the center with an interesting seasoning. They give you an OK amount for the price, but I think they should give more.

Smoothies - order the jumbo size. It's the best deal in town. It's the Big Gulp of bubble teas. All of the fruit they use are real. The tea also has good flavor as well. I've never found boba quality as high as Half & Half tea house in LA, but... It's good here. Sometimes a lil bit too soft, but better than a lot of places in Vegas. My total for a jumbo smoothie with boba was 5.14, not too sha-bay!

What's also great is that they are open later than most places. While most of them close between 8:30 to 10pm on the weekdays, this place closes at midnight. The same time the werewolves come out...",4

Strawberry Banana Chocolate Smoothie:
I got this with boba. This is one of my favorite flavor combos. Equal parts of delicious strawberry, chocolate and banana. The black balls were soft in the mouth. Mmmm... 4/5

Thai Milk Tea:
As if a big cup of smoothie wasn't enough, I also had to try the Thai tea boba milk tea - I love this stuff. This was a bit too sweet though. 3/5

Pork and Cabbage Dumplings:
You can either get 8pcs or 14pcs. Make your own dipping sauce. I'll give the sauce I made 5 stars (self love). The dumplings were a bit doughy but it has lots of hot steamy juices so it's understandable. The filling was tasty. 3/5

Beef Noodle Soup:
The noodles were thick like chow mein...maybe, it WAS chow mein. They're a bit generous with the beef chunks and chopped Chinese cabbage. This reminds me more of Filipino beef mami than the mildly spicy Chinese/Taiwanese beef noodle soup. If this was sold to me as beef mami then I'd give it 4 stars but since it's beef noodle soup...2/5

I had the lamb, cabbage, carrot dumpling. figured since their name had dumpling in it that's what they'd specialize in. it was around $10. Very average. Nothing special. Not worth the price. also had the Thai tea and that wasn't too bad. however, there really isn't anything that stands out about this place and I won't be coming here again or be recommending it to anybody.",2
1517692,LNF48Ib9qG8Kl8ZUnOV5aw,1MRWXUsIvKNwt5SdLxqhZA,"The service is such garbage, the food isn't great either. Came at 3pm on a Saturday and they were about half full. We had to request water three times before it actually came. My party ordered pho, dumplings, and some rice plates. The rice plates was filling but the pho was not. The combination pho was pretty bland to me and no hoisin sauce to make it better. We also ordered four smoothies with our food but it never came and we asked the waiter and he made it like 5 minutes before we finished our meal. The drinks were refreshing, and its pretty cheap for what it is. Overall the food is pretty unsatisfying but it's cheap so that sort of makes it okay.",2
1517693,aDF1vWwj3-89oogaip_YLA,1MRWXUsIvKNwt5SdLxqhZA,"Time for an update and an upgrade. Since discovering this place a few months ago I've found myself coming here quite often and pretty much anytime I'm craving a boba drink or fruit smoothie. Their drinks are the best in town and for the price ($3.50-4.00 avg for medium) you really can't beat it in quality, especially because they use fresh fruit in their smoothies. I've never had a bad drink here and their consistency is what keeps me coming back. My favorite drinks here are their mango smoothie and taro milk tea. Don't forget to grab a stamp card to take advantage of their Buy 10 Get 1 Free offer, although you can only choose from the medium tea drinks when you redeem a free one. Medium is the recommended size because the large is pretty big unless you're drinking on an empty stomach or sharing.

I haven't actually eaten an actual meal here in a while but regularly get orders of their popcorn chicken, which is probably the best I've had in town for the $5.50 price point. It's always made fresh so it might take about 10 minutes to get it. I've also had their dumplings and green onion pancake and they were really good. I like the thick skin on the dumplings so they don't break as easily. 1 order of dumplings is 14 pieces, but they now also have a smaller order of 8 which is good so you can try other things on the menu as well. The green onion pancake is freshly fried, greasy and crispy and for only $2.50, it's a yummy good deal. They also sell pho now which is a little weird because the owners and staff are Chinese and the rest of their menu is Chinese/Taiwanese.

The only thing I wish they could do better is their service since they usually only have 1 server, who also doubles as the cashier and is usually 1 of 2 teenage looking guys who sometimes seem like they have no idea what they're doing. As long as the older lady makes your drink, you'll have one of consistent quality. There was only 1 time where 1 of the kids made my drink and I felt like it wasn't as good and I got less boba than usual.",5

My boyfriend and I are hard core boba heads and we just needed our fix tonight. Being that it's our first time here, we even went as far as buying 3 drinks total between the 2 of us. You really let us down! Weak flavor, mushy boba, whack customer service - all terrible. 

Here's the story: 
I ordered the lemon honey green tea with half boba. Man, I didn't expect it to come out with the whole lemon, seeds, bitter rind, pulp and all. The wide boba straw slurped up all of the seeds every time I would take a sip. I choked on a few. Then I decided I couldn't go through with it, it just didn't taste right, and brought the drink back to the counter.

The guy was not having it. He told us that the drink is not for us to taste, but for us to buy... Whaaa? Wait huh? Accent or no accent, those are some fighting words mister. He then said he would pick out the seeds for us. Ugh. No, the drink tastes weird mister. It's not good. At all. 

He said he would not exchange the drink out for something else. We had to stand at the counter for a while and firmly tell him that we would like to have the almond milk tea instead, that the the lemon seeds were horrible. After a few minutes of going back and forth he then tried to exchange it out for a small almond milk tea with no boba. Lol. This guy is a character. So stingy! 

In the end he gave in and we got the almond milk tea with boba - woohoo an even (embarrassing) exchange. 

To my dismay, the drink tasted like a lot of hatred went into it. My almond milk tea tasted like pure powdered thick milk. That's the flavor I got. Why you gotta hate to hard?

Not to mention the other 2 drinks we got: durian slush and red bean slush - were super watery! Icy slushy ice is what we ended up getting. 

To be fair: they were clean inside, had a huge menu (they even have a vietnamese menu!) the drinks were cheap, not a sugar bomb, and they are open late!

As for the food -- well, it's comfort food. I think they give the right amount of serving for the price they offer and the taste is good enough for me to eat as much as 10 dumplings in one sitting (which is a lot for a tiny Asian girl like me). I usually get the pork and cabbage dumplings and veggie steamed buns and dip them like crazy in a mixture of soy sauce and vinegar. Yum.

Their selection of drinks is okay as well. They're all in the same price range as other Boba places but the real winner is that they serve super fresh fruit smoothies. Now, this is just me being nitpicky, but I also wish they served Jasmine Tea with milk and Boba, too. Or just Jasmine tea itself with lychee syrup. That tastes bomb.

I don't think I'll ever stop coming to this place (bonus points since it's beside my favourite Korean cosmetics store!). I just really hope they improve on their service.",3

1517714,h-roodFGduVxOkOscjPgtA,1MRWXUsIvKNwt5SdLxqhZA,"Very nice, friendly dumpling house in Chinatown area with refreshingly straightforward menu (listed on the wall, on a giant poster for easy reference) and simple, non-garish interior.  Open late until 2am, which is perfect for late night food hunters who are looking to eat dumplings and other related Chinese food. The xlb here is good and juicy with decent skin thickness, and I would recommend that here.  They have a variety of different types of dumplings and filling, ranging from combinations of ground pork, cabbage, shrimp, beef, and lamb.  I stayed with the traditional pork and cabbage pan fried dumplings and was not disappointed. It's very authentic here and the young owners appear to have come here from mainland China or Taiwan, so I'm assuming they know what their food should taste like.  Inside is also a full on milk tea boba juice bar, which could be a whole store in itself judging by the selections.

They were almost empty when I arrived, which concerned me, but the staff was friendly and the posted menu inviting, so I braved it. 

I still really wanted noodles, so skipped the dozen or so different dumplings offered and got beef noodle soup. 

It was tasty and a very generous portion - I got two complete meals out of it. Big, tender pieces of meat, only one of which was the fatty, spit-into-your-napkin type. Very yum. 

As I ate, the place filled up. I must have come at the perfect time - I wouldn't have been able to find a seat if I had come later, so yay them!

Standards have never slipped - emphasis on simple, fresh ingredients, prepared into comfort food.  I've gotten adventurous and my favorite smoothie is off their ""crazy fruit"" menu - papaya, watermelon, strawberry, banana and (yes) avocado. The avocado gives it a creamy, almost milkshake texture that is really satisfying.  A huge kick of vitamin C and potassium - I go to Chi Kung classes at the Lohan school down the block and this smoothie is frequently my post-class dinner.

Another staple is the peanut, celery and carrot salad.  Boiled peanuts and the celery/carrots are just blanched - lightly steamed, but still crunchy.  Tossed in chili oil and spices (but not too hot).  The perfect healthy snack and I've gotten several co-workers addicted to it!

They've introduced more menu items and I have yet to find anything that doesn't work - various kinds of new pho (the rare beef round steak pho is sensational), fried snapper (little whole fishes flash tempura fried, super tasty!), turnip stripe pancake (more of a mini eggroll pie then a pancake; so delicious - filled with mashed turnip, a bit of meat and assorted vegetables.  Its a meal in itself and less than $4!!).

They also started selling their homemade dumplings frozen by the bag - comes in a freezer bag of 50 pieces.  I have pork and cabbage dumplings in my freezer right now.  $25 or $30 for 50 dumplings (depends on the type) - I throw them into some broth for a quick soup at home.

Service is always friendly and the prices are incredibly reasonable, even compared to some of the other restaurants in Chinatown.  They're open from 10 a.m. to 2 a,m. - I've been here when they first open and after midnight - quality is still there, no matter what time it is.",5

I ordered vegetarian eggrolls and popcorn chicken.
The vegetarian eggrolls seemed to be frozen, as when we received them the inside was pretty much vegetable mush. But they were still pretty good.
The popcorn chicken was incredibly decent, I'm used to spicy dishes growing up in a Hispanic household, so the chicken was bland. But it was crispy and juicy and filling. 

I also ordered a jasmine milk tea and my friend got a green apple tea.

It's located in what I call the ""heart of the east side"" where China Olive use to be at. It's pretty small compared to other Buffet @ Asia restaurants, but the building itself was already pretty small.

Anyways.. Expect a wait. Not too long of a wait though. They're pretty quick on getting people in and out.

The food itself is your standard Chinese food. If you go during dinner, they have a selection on crab which is my favorite! I don't come here with high expectations, so I'm pretty well satisfied at the end of my meal. Their sushi is actually pretty decent as well.

I was forced to dine here by my roommate who likes buffets.... Two fish dishes were great; however, all the basics(orange chicken; beef; seafood delight) were awful. The only remotely exciting dish was fried potstickers(the frozen food aisle ones).

The kid and I were starving. We were headed to Thai BBQ in the same plaza but decided to change things up at the last minute. So into Taste of China we went...

Pretty quiet, clean considering the age of the building and not busy at all. There were two other tables seated and the owner let us pick our table. Bathroom was clean (super plus). Service was quick and friendly.

I ordered the MaPo tofu (I'm a temporary vegetarian and it's been pretty difficult considering the spots we normally patronize...) It was tasty, slightly salty and not as spicy as I had hoped which was my fault for not specifying the level of heat I desired for the day haha. My picky child had the sesame chicken (sauce on the side) and she enjoyed it. Portions were pretty large and came with a side of white rice, some pickled cabbage and a dish of roasted peanuts. We ended up boxing up about 2/3 of our food.

Against my better judgment, I ordered a snow ice... not that it tasted bad... I was just too full and I knew my daughter wouldn't touch it. It was actually really good. For $6.50 you get to choose a base and three toppings plus condensed milk. For an extra dollar you can pick a trio of base flavors; additional toppings are 50¢ each. According to the server, snow ice is a cross between shaved ice and ice cream; ""fluffy""she said. #itssofluffyicoulddie. I went with Thai tea as a base and red bean, lychee jelly and egg pudding as toppings with condensed milk drizzled on top. #NOM yeah. Totally finished the entire thing. By myself. Haha.

Dinner for two/dessert for one fat mom = $24 ... scratch that... $19. #awesome.

General Tso was up to par, crispy and hot, not that soggy stuff that you sometimes find at a lower end buffet.

Kung Pao shrimp consisted of smaller pieces of shrimp than I'm used to getting at my go to spot and the side ingredients weren't varied...pretty much, peanuts, celery and more peanuts and more celery....seemed to be lacking some diced peppers, onions, cucumber or whatever other vegetable medley goes in a kung pao.

Szechuan beef was pretty standard.

It's so far been my favorite main dish there. My husband was quite happy with his dish as well. Now I am not a fan of chitterlings but they do an excellent job of cleaning them so they don't smell like s#%t. They were also well seasoned and it really did'nt taste like what you think of when you think of traditional southern chitterlings, it was way better. 

The service here is also good we've never had any problems coming here. Even though from the outside it looks like a hole in the wall inside is very warm and welcoming. However it's not Vegas flashy so if that's what you need don't bother coming here. It really is worth a try though for authentic Chinese food.",4

This place was totally dead on a Sunday evening, got my thai tea boba in about three minutes flat and waited only a few minutes for my chicken moo goo gai, total was $12, not bad at all and portion was enough for lunch and dinner.

Boba seemed mushy and almost overcooked, as if maybe it had been sitting around.
Thai tea was flavorless- tasted like slightly sweetened water, very bizarre.
Chicken moo goo gai was just chicken and mushrooms in a light sauce- which I actually preferred to the usual mix of other lesser veggies. Giant portion, rice was a bit gummy (also as if it had been sitting in the warmer for a while).

Would grab takeout here again, but would prefer to go when they actually have business so my food has a greater chance of being made fresh. Sounds backwards, I know.",3

After waiting 2 Hours and 15 minutes, no one came. I had to call the restaurant to find out that ""because of traffic, we can't deliver your order.""

On top of that they charged me $7 for delivery fee.

What a joke.",1

The food is Szechuan and they have some American-Chinese food such as beef broccoli and Orange chicken.",4

Good thing I had cash.  I had beef w/ broccoli....Very, very tasteless. I can't overstate that. Broccoli was like it was steamed and not cooked with the beef. The sauce was watery and had no flavor. The beef was tough, undercooked, and had no flavor. I'm hoping their food will get better once they settle in. There were no carrots, onions, etc., just broccoli and beef with steamed white rice. I wasn't happy with my meal. The soup was tasty.....But not enough to save this meal.",1
1532301,1xQak33RPaMKsrqI5_FptA,crt6xd0yvBzk4ayuYta8eA,"This is my second visit to this restaurant on the same week because food was that great! 

Their service is generally pretty good until they get too busy. Well it is a Chinese restaurant, so my expectation of service is typically lower. 

Okay now their food. I haven't tried one dish that I didn't like. They make their food just the right amount of salt unlike some other shanghainese restaurants in town. Let me break down to the list of all the dishes that I've tried.

Appetizers
1. Smoked fish($7.99)- I like the sweet and not so salty smoke flavor. This is a appetizer so expect a very small plate. However, there was lots of bones in the fish so don get it if you are not a fan of picking the fish out of the bones.
2. Cold chicken in wine sauce($7.99) - I really like this dish in general. Theirs were pretty yummy! Not too salty but I wish the wine flavor can be little stronger. 

Appetizers was the reason that I took off one star because the portion did not measure up to the price and they had to charge for rice. I guess many restaurants now do charge for rice. 

Shanghai tapas
1. Xiao long baos($6.99)- they are pretty tasty although we had some that was broken so there was no soup inside of buns.
2. Pan fried buns ($7.99) - flavor of the buns was pretty good but there was no soup inside of buns which was not what I had expected. 
3. Rice ball in wine soup($6.90) - I love this dessert here! Homemade rice balls are so yummy!! And the soup matched up so perfectly! 

Entrees
1. Sweet and sour spare ribs($11.99)- it's one of my favorite dish there. I can eat half plate by myself lol. It has perfect amount of sugar and vinegar in the sauce.
2. Meatballs with vegetables (lion heads)($10.99) - I really like this dish too! It's very authentic. The homemade meatballs taste very fresh because I can tell when pork has been sitting in the fridge for too long. 
3. Braised pork in soy sauce($10.99) - this dish is pretty good too but if you are not the fan of fat then you should not get this dish because half of the dish consists of fatty part of pork.
4. Braised sea cucumber($16.99) - the favor is not bad but I think I personally like sea cucumber in lighter kind of sauce. 
5. Stir fried shredded eel($16.99) - it's not bad but not eel is not my personal flavor. Although the sauce did make it more appealing to me.
6. Beef with peanuts in hot sauce ($9.99)- I love that they put a lot a lot of mushrooms in this dish. Beef was kinda chewy so I will order chicken one next time. 
7. House friend rice cakes($7.99) - flavor was good but I personally would like it withe just a little less soy sauce. 

Soup
Duck soup with bamboo shoots($18.99) - I love soup and I love this clean light broth that came in a clay pot with generous portion. I couldn't get enough of this soup!! 

All entrees has really generous portion. I'm so thankful there is another great Chinese restaurant in town and wanted to thank my friend Jackie who brought me there! I will definitely return regularly.",4

I don't remember what we ordered since every time I'm with my mom, she does all the ordering :) Anyways, the food was delicious and fresh. Not only was the food great, the waitress was amazing and even gave us a free small dish to sample. I love service like this. I definitely would come back, but hopefully not for awhile... Not because of the restaurant but because I'm sick of Vegas.",4

The Garlic Eggplant Claypot was good, but too oily. I don't really like food soaked in oil. I also ordered a refreshing watermelon juice without sugar (you can easily make this at home, just blend ice with watermelon). The Shanghai Panfried rolls were delicious too. There was sesame seeds on the bottom which made it extra crispy when you bite into it.

They have XLBs and when I first starting going, it was yummy! 
But after a couple of tries, it became inconsistent. 
I'm not sure if it was the time of day I was going and a different chef, but sometimes it would have no juice, and sometimes it did but over-steamed which made the wrapper burst. 

Other items I've tried include their string beans, cabbage and Chinese greens, and they were all good. But nothing I couldn't get somewhere else. 

I would come back, and hope the XLBs are on point.",3

Why you got to tease us like this Edamame? If every time we came in we got the good Xiao Long Bao, I would give you 5 Stars...that's how good they are! But when they range from 2 Stars to 5 Stars what am I supposed to do with that? You let me down. When I think I'm going to get wonderfully flavorful XLB with spoon-fulls of soup broth...and then I get a whole order of broken or dry dumplings. I do mind. The Dude minds. This will not stand. This aggression will not stand...

Service is good. We've consistently enjoyed other items, but not so much that we would come in for them.

Come here for Shanghai food!
Come here to roll the dice on what just might be the best XLBs in town...or might be Vegas routine below average XLBs. BTW, they are still as good as the options you would find at most Vegas places.",3

1541689,dpCK6l5ODZieJpl70KCTFQ,GNKYSfEwRL7enQYBKeA76Q,"This place needs help. I've only been here once but was not impressed at all. Prices were high. Quality was low. Rice is extra although the girl at the front gave to me a little for no charge. She was sweet but I don't even know if she understood what I said. Not really that tasty either. It looked like only relatives were the ones eating there. The kid said they bought from the old owners and also that the chef that stayed from the old place was let go recently even after staying with the new owners. The menu is a little complicating. Just very plain and the headings and the items were the same font which makes it hard to discern between the different categories. Wow! I should really be an adviser. So many places I go to that I could help with only a few small changes. But, no one thinks I know what I'm talking about.",2
1545229,Ob0qeAyCcb0OgMuK4-5qGA,MJLe4pP-0ZOFHuFt0CIoRw,"If their Shanghai Xiao Long Bao 小籠包 is the only item on their menu, I would still be dropping by this latest Chinese restaurant to open up in Las Vegas's greater Chinatown area. Now before you all go crazy and question why it is only getting 4 and not 5 stars on Yelp, let me explain.

It is good, not the best I've ever had, but I enjoyed it. In fact, after my unplanned XLB crawl of the 2 newest restaurants that serve it to open up on the west side, I can say A & K Chinese Restaurant (aka Heng Long Chinese Restaurant, if going by their name on the credit card receipt) was the clear winner of the head-to-head XLB CHALLENGE over Edamame Restaurant on Wednesday, May 7th, 2014.  

You don't have to take my word for it though. What I think is ""good"" could be ""that is the worst, flavorless blah blah I have ever had!""  (Funny random thought: what if water is being judged right now?)

Anyway, seems like we are blessed with more and more XLB options in Las Vegas, which means to make it, the chefs all have to up their games. Translation: consumers are the winner. Yay!

I also had their Three Treasures Dumpling 三鮮水餃 (12pcs) per order and it was pretty good too. The fact they hand make these is just wonderful.

On my first visit I also tried their Pan Fried Pork Bun 生煎包 (8 pcs) $7.95. If you go by yourself, this item alone will be enough to send you home with a full belly. It was just okay, the doughy bun on the outside is thinker than what I have had in Taiwan (which was THE BEST 生煎包 at that busy night market), so maybe not fair comparison.

Beef Pancake Roll 牛肉卷餅 $7.95. Decent. There are better ones I have had within a 2 mile radius.

Hot Purple Sweet Potato Juice 紫薯汁, small $2.25. It was an experience to try this. It is basically purple sweet potato drink, not really sweet, but a creamy dessert alternative beverage.

Service overall was good.  I happened to have been there when they were not busy, so that might have helped too. Plus I can speak enough Mandarin Chinese to get by in restaurants, so that certainly helped.

Decor/Ambiance was pleasant. Music playing in the background was not Chinese, but instrumentals of popular American songs, which you probably wouldn't even pay attention to unless you focus on it.

Price/Value: I think it was good overall. 

Note: this is NOT your typical Chinese takeout restaurants. I must admit I am not familiar with most of their menu offerings, because I am not at all an expert on Shanghainese cuisine. But they also described their cuisine as 新派江浙 (New style of Jiangsu and Zhejiang - per Google Translate, which is still like Hexcodes to me). But come for their XLB, and if you are adventurous enough, you can explore their other menu items.

Expect an UYE for Xiao Long Bao 小籠包 crawl and another one to just explore this restaurant's menu (yeah, I am definitely gonna need backup).

Bonus: Love that American Express is accepted along with other forms of credit card payments.  :)

Review #23 of 2014",4
1545230,RxUkLt8WbI81smCv22yl6g,MJLe4pP-0ZOFHuFt0CIoRw,"We heard of the XLBs here from Tony's review, but alas they had none. We've heard from other friends of them not having any so perhaps it's something they make only a certain time, so calling may be a good idea. 

Me and my friends decided to do family dinner, but left ordering up to the only one of us that spoke the language to pick and order up for us so excuse that I don't have the official menu description/name for everything.

We started with steam buns that had small crispy shrimp, leek and dried tofu to fill it with. This had good flavor and I enjoyed the bitty shrimp in it. 

Edamame, mustard greens and pork - I've had this dish at other places and this was pretty standard, but good. I thought it was decently prepared. 

Rice cakes with greens - I love rice cakes and this is one of my favorite, basic ways of preparing it because of my brother and I ordering it often before. 

Steamed fish special on their wall - it was fresh fish in a simple soy and sesame sauce with ginger and cilantro on top. 

Green onion pancake - theirs was just OK. It was a bit dense and didnt have those flaky layers in between, just crispness from the outside. There are better places for this dish. 

Steam dumplings - these were pretty decent, though the wrapper of mine fell apart so maybe needed less time steaming. 

Beef pancake roll - this was pretty good. I havent had one in Vegas yet so I can't compare elsewhere, but I liked it.

We got a pitcher of carrot juice to drink. 

The service was just okay. I'm worried about a language barrier perhaps as they were speaking Chinese to a friend that didn't speak it.

The food was good and they had a large menu full of stuff that sounded intriguing that warrants a return. I'm not really a expert in Shanghainese cuisine at all, but everything was pretty good and reminded me of growing up with my half siblings who are Chinese.",4
1545231,UYkuV1_oxMCWImvNofyfgA,MJLe4pP-0ZOFHuFt0CIoRw,"Simply, some of the best Chinese food in Las Vegas. And the prices are very reasonable. 

This is authentic Chinese food: Menu in mandarin? Check. Restaurant packed with local Chinese folks looking for a taste of the mother country? Uh huh. DHS human trafficking surveillance van in parking lot across the street? Yup! (Just kidding!!)

The kids love to have ""exotic food"", and they devoured this stuff. We tried the fish in tasty sauce as a main dish ($19). It came out in a huge bowl and was on top of a pile of veggies & garlic. I was nervous at first because of all the garlic, but the sauce was the perfect balance of spice and flavor. 

We also had fried rice and a crispy noodle with seafood medley. Definitely going back to this place. Please check them out.",4
1545232,4yXKaxjTb1s-tLHHrhvMGw,MJLe4pP-0ZOFHuFt0CIoRw,Food was good. Prices were fine. Service was fast and friendly. Restaurant was clean and pleasant. Will visit again.,4
1545233,AUvhBjexqyb0LoX_s2SK5w,MJLe4pP-0ZOFHuFt0CIoRw,"This is an excellent authentic Chinese restaurant. I stopped by and asked the waitress what she recommends without really looking at the menu.  She suggested a beef soup that included lots of beef (with tendons), radishes, hot peppers, and sour vegetables. It is a really good choice if you are into a unique soup that is both spicy and sour.

The service was excellent - the waitress was friendly and good about refilling my water.  The owner came out from the kitchen to ask about how I liked my food and chat with me.  This restaurant is outside of the main Chinatown area so it is likely to not be as crowded as some of the other Chinese restaurants.",5
1545234,mN7c_LFoAPpX-Uqrovte2A,MJLe4pP-0ZOFHuFt0CIoRw,"A newcomer to the Spring Mountain scene, I'm glad Shanghainese cuisine is starting to make itself known to the Vegas Asian food scene joining the ranks of Bund Shanghai, Edamame, and 1900 Asian Cuisine.

With my father's side being of Shanghainese ancestry, perhaps it is somewhat of a birthright for me to evaluate the quality of such aforementioned cuisine. Having sampled all the other restaurants except for Edamame, I can say that A&K is the best of the bunch, but I wish the others well since competition will only push and sustain the quality of offerings all around.  

A little primer on Shanghainese cuisine:  the flavors tend to involve dishes enhanced with salted meats/preserved vegetables, often blending sweet with savory, lots of seafood (being close to the sea), and all kinds of wondrous carbalicious concoctions involving dumplings baked/fried/steamed, savory rice cakes, thick pan-fried noodles, and buns filled with meat/chinese veggies.

Xiao long bao (soup dumplings) and sheng jian bao (pan-fried pork buns) are popular staple items that are fun to share in groups dipped in some vinegar and ginger so be sure to try these if they are available on the menu.  If you've been spoiled by places in Taiwan or LA/Vancouver, it may not be up to par, but it definitely satisfies the craving.  

The sweet and sour spare ribs are just like my mother's recipe, a delicate balance between soy sauce, rice wine, rice vinegar, and sugar glazed and crisped to perfection around wok charred spare ribs meant to be enjoyed immediately to retain the fragrance off of the wok.  Don't even dare mistaking this dish's namesake with the Panda Express concoction with the toxic red sauce and deep-fried styrofoam coating in their sweet and sour dishes, this is the real deal!

The dungeness crab served with rice cakes was the real show stopper (see photo).  Fresh crab coated with a wondrous trinity of ginger/garlic/scallion is delicious enough on its own, but add a bed of glutinous pan-fried rice cakes with chili paste, and one's tastebuds are transported to Shanghai Shangri-la.  If you're feeling less spendy and indulgent, the rice cakes with pickled cabbage or chinese spinach is a good alternative.

There was a soup dish on the menu whose name I can't recall that contained salted pork, chinese squash, and thin squares of scrambled egg with a frittata-like consistency, that provided a nice contrast to the typical bold dishes described above with delicate flavors and velvety textures, so if you see something close to that description, it is a nice intermission between the fireworks of flavor noted above.

Some dishes that missed the mark were the salted pork soup with tofu skins (a bit too salty) and the fried yellow fish with pickled vegetables (great flavor but the wet ingredients negated the crispy coating on the fish).

All in all, a solid addition to the neighborhood with tasty Shanghainese dishes that won't leave you feeling Shanghai-ed.

Pro-tip:  They have fresh pressed juices (most including carrot) that are on the house if your food bill exceeds a specific threshold (somewhere in the 30s I think), providing a nice palate cleanser post-dinner.",4
1545235,sCOsq6gMQTXN_2eD1gKlmg,MJLe4pP-0ZOFHuFt0CIoRw,"One of my favorites. Great customer service and appears to be clean.

In cmparison with Bund, China Mama, Y. M. Taiwan Deli, this is superior. The wait staff is very attentive and not hovering. The Green Onion Pancake is done properly with multiple layers and not greasy. The Pork/cabbage buns have good fillings and the bread is a little on the dense side, but good. The XLB's are juicy and tasty. The beef roll is good  and not greasy from frying. The stir fry Chinese New Year rice cake has a good mix of vegetables and proper amount of shredded pork. It is not done with a heavy sauce. Finally, the prices are very appropriate. Their dinner menu and daily specials look good but I have not yet tried anything on this occasion. Will return for that. I recommend this place.",4
1545237,dKUwACG6b-1v56sfInFzZg,MJLe4pP-0ZOFHuFt0CIoRw,"XLB in the hizzy! This place is clean and humble. Plus, our server was attentive and friendly. We were having difficulty narrowing down what to order; when the server suggested the xiao long bao as the way to go, we didn't hesitate and ordered it right away. 

The XLB (Xiao Long Bao/ Shanghai soup dumplings) $6.95 weren't too shabby. I've certainly had better, but I also have no other place that I can compare it to in Vegas. Although they were a tad bit bland for my personal taste, there was plenty of warm broth in each dumpling. You need to make sure to eat the dumplings with the provided black vinegar ginger sauce - it compliments and helps season it up substantially. Flavor rating: 3/5

We also tried the chili oil & peanut butter cold noodles $6.95. It's a big heaping bowl of spaghetti type noodles topped with minced beef in a thick chili peanut oil sauce. I honestly felt that the menu description was a little misleading - there is nothing peanut buttery about the noodles? Plus I couldn't taste peanut butter or sesame ingredients for the life of me. I suppose the dish wasn't terrible after we doused it with soy sauce, more vinegar sauce, and chili oil to wake it up. Flavor rating: 2/5

If XLB is what you're hankering for, I would suggest giving this place a try; you may find them to be satisfying.",3

Wrapper is thick enough to hold in the soup but still thin and not chewy. Meat inside has great flavor and soup is abundant. Make sure to eat with vinegar and fresh ginger which they will provide on the side. I have been to China Mama, Bund Shanghai, Three Villages (closed) and 1900 Asian Cuisine (closed) and this place is the best by far! This review is only for the XLB.",5
1546237,N--BhwOrf2-6vwodFHKz3A,8T4aPvtpugzUxJc-DVrLHg,"I love Chinese dumplings!  Especially if the succulent wrappers used to encase the dumpling fillings are hand made and the dumplings are assemble and cook to order. It is a major comfort food category for me. In fact 餃子 boiled dumplings is the first item I have ever personally ordered on my own with lunch money my mom gave me for elementary school in Taipei. It was just a few pennies each and the shop made it and delivered it in a plastic bag to my school with my name on it just in time for lunch break.  I don't remember much about how it tasted, but the memory of having tremendous emotional satisfaction and joy from that simple meal is still very strong.

So while driving to try out a new ramen place a few miles down the street, the light from this new restaurant caught my eye, and I decided to make a quick,but very safe u-turn into the small parking lot in front of Dumpling King.  There are plenty of spaces in the back of the building, in case this restaurant gets super popular in the coming weeks. I was initially afraid that I was dropping in as the restaurant was about to close, since it was fairly empty inside, but looking at their hours of operation, I was relieved to see that I had 1.25 hours left.

I made a quick scan of the restaurant, and pretty much was blinded by all the red color in the restaurant.  Red floral printed seat covers over each chair.  The tablecloth were reddish in color, and the lighting was fairly dim, so yeah I was slightly disoriented from the color red.  I wonder if that is a normal reaction or it is just one of those minor details that made me just a little different from the other 6 odd billion people on this planet (not including the aliens that left zigzag lights over the skies of Hawaii).

Anyway, after picking a nearby table with good lighting for taking food pictures and going over the menu, I eventually found the ""dumpling"" section all the way on the last page under ""Main Food"" and ordered the following:

101. Beef Steamed Dumplings(4) 牛肉蒸餃 - Decent flavor, but I felt the texture of the filling was off. Like it was overground or overworked.

102. Beef Dumplings(4) 牛肉水餃 - Same filling as the above, except this dumpling is boiled.

103. Lamb Dumplings(4) 羊肉水餃 - Good dumpling, nice lamb flavor. Dumpling is also boiled and looks exactly like the Beef Dumpling.

112. Stone Dumplings 水晶餃子 - This is like a big plate full of pot stickers that is cooked in a pan, and inverted onto the plate. The residual starchy water forms a thin crust that connects all of the dumplings together (see the picture).  It is kind of cool looking, but eat these fast.  Because I was taking time to take pictures, and all the food came more or less at the same time, I noticed that a small pool of oil puddle up on the plate after like 10 minutes, which made it taste not as good as the very first piece I had.  Just something to think about if you are dining solo or eat very slowly.

NOTE: Although their menu have prices listed for dumplings with portions of (4), I was told that it was a misprint and now the minimum order is (8) dumplings, so you now need to order those items x2.  But for the Beef and Lamb Dumplings that comes out to (8 pieces) for $5, not too bad price wise, but does present an additional hurdle against trying as much of the menu as possible without asking for the doggie bag.  They did however let me order four pieces of each of the Beef Dumplings and Lamb Dumplings, for a total of eight pieces, since both are cooked the same way.

Overall, I thought the food was A-OK at this family operated restaurant (Mom, and son both works here in the front, and the dad is likely in the kitchen cooking).  It is the closest Chinese dumpling restaurant to where I live for now, so I will be stopping by in the near future.  Plus I asked to see if they also can make Xiao Long Bao, given that they are calling themselves the Dumpling King and serve many of the dumpling specialties from the same region, and was told that they just added that to their menu that day.  Would have been nice to offer up such information when I was reading the menu or at the time I was placing my orders, but oh well. Just another reason to go back. Maybe later for dinner.

Credit cards are accepted here, but when I gave them my AmEx card (there is a AmEx sticker along with the usual suspects on the front door) but was asked to pay with a different card (because American Express charges a higher fee - perhaps, but more likely due to AmEx not distributing the funds to their merchant clients for an entire billing cycle). Yeah, pretty much all the small vendors are hating on AmEx, and to think (if you are old enough) that they once dominated the credit card market. Oh how the mighty has fallen indeed.  

3.5 stars.  I am sure another update will be forth coming should I get to try the XLB on my next visit.

1546238,2Q6fu3MAMifkGkNJ2RU5Bg,8T4aPvtpugzUxJc-DVrLHg,"Finally a northern chinese food place in vegas, i been looking for one forever. The owner are super friendly, the food are good if you enjoy traditional northern chinese food.",5
1546239,nV1SmUCAeZVmcix3aebixQ,8T4aPvtpugzUxJc-DVrLHg,"New dumpling resturant, not sure if anyone else can recommend other dumpling resturants but this is very delicious. 

I brought my friends from LA here and they enjoyed it too!

The decorations are red and flowers as seen in pictures. They have private rooms: party size and large.

Must order: lamb dumplings!! You can't go wrong with it!

Parking is a bit limited but there is some in the back.

Local mom and pop resturant! I support local restaurants!",5
1546240,F1micbGewg5UJsykyxy_Ow,8T4aPvtpugzUxJc-DVrLHg,Wonderful dumplings!  Great service as well.  We had the soup and the stone dumplings.,5
1546241,goehNZOakIehhUXrRSzcuw,8T4aPvtpugzUxJc-DVrLHg,"Dine on Thursday night, we were only customer while we almost checking out one family came in. Furthermore,  I ordered beef dumpling, lamb with green onion stir fry,  and clear cold noodle. All food I ordered was all salty~ extreme~ so we got canned herbal tea but later 2 can herbal tea equals $7? Goodness I can buy dozen of chinese can herbal tea one block from u~~~~ too costly. Service was so horrible, Server was on phone neither one chef... I can tell why there was nobody dine in. Not recommended!",2
1546242,XQnXyelPjtYA6wF4fBC2qw,8T4aPvtpugzUxJc-DVrLHg,"I'm surprised this place doesn't have more reviews! I have been to many dumpling joints that have served soup aka juicy dumplings and this place is the BEST I've ever had. This is the most soup I've seen in a dumpling ever!! The green onion pancakes were also very fluffy and the serving was generous. It was my third time there and I would definitely return!!

They are great for take out as well. Very friendly, offering you water and tea while you wait for your order!",5
1546243,9GWY-hTt81atkQt0Xcm9DQ,8T4aPvtpugzUxJc-DVrLHg,"We Drove up to the new business for the first time and hesitated to go in bc there was no one in the restaurant but us, so we thought we give it a try anyway. We ordered beef dumpling, Steamed soup dumpling, and home made soup all tasted great. best dumpling in town, minus the loud red chair decor. Love the glass window to view chef Making their dumpling from scratch similar to Ding Tai Fung. Will be back for more juicy dumplings.",5
1546244,YcNucGO9D_2nm94eiRuggw,8T4aPvtpugzUxJc-DVrLHg,"My husband and I were finding a place to have lunch and drove by this place. I yelped it right away and we decided to give it a try due to the good rating. And we are happy for the decision because we like the food here a lot. The food is very close to what I had in Beijing. We tried beef dumplings (steamed), beef stuffed cake, cold noodle with white sesame sauce. They were all good. We definitely will go back.",4
1546245,aPxYMQVA27rRsh3vf3M6jw,8T4aPvtpugzUxJc-DVrLHg,"The place is clean for now. Asian restaurants always scare me in that respect. The decor is super tacky but the owner is proud of it. These are simple people. The husband cooks while the son and mom serve. You can tell the son and mom are not professional servers but they are nice and friendly. The food is northern Chinese which focuses on dough products like noodles and dumplings. They also don't serve pork. Everything is flavorful and it was a nice change from the Cantonese Chinese restaurants. If you don't know Northern Chinese food, you might be in for a shock. The place was very good for down home northern Chinese cooking, but not for everyone. It's not your typical Chinese restaurant food, so if you don't know it, you probably won't like it. It's more like Chinese country comfort food.

We didn't get to try the soup dumplings until recently. They are not very good. Bund Shanghai and 1900 have better soup dumplings for sure.",3
1546246,osemUJvKA3wfb1UcO4y8vg,8T4aPvtpugzUxJc-DVrLHg,"This place really surprised me on how good the food is. The dumpling are freshly made, and they even have their own specialty chef that make some of the dumplings. The owner is very nice and kind. The place is very clean and tidy. Don't forget to try the stone dumpling and the Shao Mai.",5
1546247,PBOPNjjQM8vaEkxwvuiRnw,8T4aPvtpugzUxJc-DVrLHg,"This place is very nice. Great service, clean environment. And the food taste very home made. Means my boyfriend really enjoyed it.",5
1546248,oqnMIdAr3ocxKtEjw-cp_w,8T4aPvtpugzUxJc-DVrLHg,"Very friendly staff. The owner greeted us and made recommendations. She served us tea while we waited for our to-go dumplings, and even gave us samples of chicken wings & dumplings. Such a sweet lady.

The dumpling wrapper is delicious. I would definitely recommend this place. Especially since they are open until 3am. Apparently the owner changed the hours.",5
1546249,Uf4elJYItaCSnrAWDsmHNA,8T4aPvtpugzUxJc-DVrLHg,"This place is great.  If you're just visiting Vegas and you're looking for some authentic northeastern Chinese food, this is definitely a place worth checking out. It's still relatively new but the food tasted amazing and authentic.  Also the staff was very friendly.  We ordered beef dumplings and they even hand-made the Chinese yellow wasabi at our request.  Definitely coming back here again when I'm in town.",5
1546250,c-d2psWFmskJ5iYt7Sii_Q,8T4aPvtpugzUxJc-DVrLHg,"I am from Northern China, and this is as close as it gets in Vegas as far as food goes. Though I thought they could use more salt, I enjoyed everything I had. 

While their lamb kabobs are only available after 6p.m., there are plenty of things to get from the menu. Dumplings are fresh and very good, I normally prefer potstickers over boiled dumplings unless they are truly good. Dumplings here are definitely good. But don't just order dumplings, their dishes all very tasty too. 

The restaurant is fairly new, so it's clean and nice inside. I almost cried when I saw the menu for the first time, where else can you find authentic double cooked pork in Vegas? If you like or want to try Northern Chinese food, this place is a must. Prices are also reasonable!

第一次看到他们家的菜单就让我感觉特别亲切，三鲜水饺，锅包肉，酸菜粉，地三鲜，酸菜羊肉粉丝汤，尖椒干豆腐，韭菜盒子，羊肉串。每周必来 :)",5
1546251,BRmRb4ecyLXcMDnfYwyMbQ,8T4aPvtpugzUxJc-DVrLHg,Good beef noodle and excellent xiao long bao. Not bad for Vegas.  Still not 626 but very enjoyable. Will come back again!,5
1546252,goZH7Rbz3NXSuwNkAGx3Bg,8T4aPvtpugzUxJc-DVrLHg,"Hubs and I went there to get me a dumpling fix and, while it's a bit of a drive, I'm glad we went.  Parking was plentiful, the dining area is squeaky clean and the owner was very friendly and helpful.

There was some confusion about Hubs' order so we ended up with more food than we really wanted, but they removed one of the dishes from the tab, which made us happy.

Stone Dumplings: OMG, yum! Slightly better than standard pot stickers I've had, and the ""crust"" was perfect for absorbing the vinegar on my plate and seasoning these without having to dunk them in a pot of sauce.

Soup Dumplings: once again, OMG yum! Perfect little bite sized dumplings of soup and filling.  Do NOT make the mistake I did of trying to just bite into one, I got soup all over the table and myself.. it's amazing how much is in each of these little dumplings.

Meat Patty: rather like a seasoned burger inside a  tortilla, not sure what all is there but it was delicious (and I'm not a burger fan)

Chicken hot pot: one of Hubs' orders, and the one he regrets most because of the large pot of Sterno underneath which nauseated him and ruined the rest of the meal for him. I only got a small taste of that one, it was furiously hot and I was having a dumpling party, but it was good. Small pieces of chopped up chicken (bones and all) seasoned and in a pot with some shredded vegetables underneath.

Duck something: I didn't catch the full name of this dish, it wasn't on the menu but recommended by the owner.  Hubs ordered this, but wasn't able to eat due to the Sterno mentioned above.  I got a small taste, it was pretty excellent duck - cooked, sliced, laid out on a platter.

We'll definitely be going back, but we'll be avoiding the hot pot dishes for Hubs' sake.  The dumplings were just THAT good :D",5
1546253,ChcR0Nw-xnC84Yhvz4q7ZA,8T4aPvtpugzUxJc-DVrLHg,"My fiance and I were excited to see a dumpling restaurant open in the area! I'm in love with soup dumplings. And China Mama down the street does a pretty good job of it. It's no 626, but its still good.

They have their own parking lot. Plus! 

But first impression is.. the place smells. It's a very pungent bathroom odor. I wouldn't mind if it smelled like cleaning supplies.. but a smelly bathroom/sewage scent is NOT the way to go when you're eating! But it's an asian restaurant. Things like this slip through the cracks all the time. We stayed. We eventually got used to it.

The menu has a lot of items! Most of the English descriptions are pretty vague. So the pictures help a lot. We got lost in all of the choices and took awhile to order.

When we did, we ordered the pan fried beef patties, the soup dumplings, and hot and sour soup. 

The patties were good. Crispy, flavorful, and tasted great with a little bit of vinegar and hot sauce.

The hot and sour soup was not as savory as other places I've had, but it was tasty as well. Full of flavor, jusy enough sour. 

The soup dumplings normally take longer and were the last to arrive at the table. Tip: normally if you know you're ordering this dish, you should put in the order first. The dumplings were good. As a personal preference, I like my dumplings more sweet than salty, but here they make it salty. Also, there is actually not that much soup in each one. 

The menu had other delicious sounding items so we'll probably be back to try other items. But they need to fix that smell!!

Overall.. 626 dumplings beats NY dumplings beats China Mama beats Dumpling King",3
1546254,zSpG_UW7SHBG64oGZ9QbyQ,8T4aPvtpugzUxJc-DVrLHg,"My first impression is the decor of the restaurant with its red floral chairs is an acquired taste.

Service is slow so if you are in a rush this is not the place to go.

I had the pan fried dumplings and the beef noodle soup.  The food is okay and it's nothing I would write more about.",3
1546255,fNrHEs3UfcQgOnerOcsUmw,8T4aPvtpugzUxJc-DVrLHg,"I normally don't write any reviews but must write for this restaurant. Been in Vegas for more than 3 years, this is the only authentic Chinese restaurant that focus on Northeast Chinese cuisine. Love all the dishes and remind me home across the Pacific Ocean. You gotta try!!!!!!!",5
1546256,MSoPo-Mraiu3tIeZ1LsdEw,8T4aPvtpugzUxJc-DVrLHg,"The soup dumpling is delicious, cumin beef, and the string beans are delicious! Will try their hot pots next time...looked delicious from the table next to us.",5
1546257,nqcEivg5FKBmKrM_7bF8Mw,8T4aPvtpugzUxJc-DVrLHg,"For being the self-proclaimed dumpling king, I would have expected way more dumplings.  We had the juicy beef dumplings, no pork option.  Salty meat and thicker skin than I prefer.  The string beans were money though.  Perfectly cooked and seasoned.  I had the onion pancake but did not like them too much because they were too bready and not as greasy and flaky as I am used to.  Everything here is freshly cooked to order.  

The whole time I was here they played Calvin Harris ""Blame"" on repeat.  That was the worst part.",3
1546258,NVHfrY09gDXLBokWqW5_lg,8T4aPvtpugzUxJc-DVrLHg,"Why 3 stars?

I was hoping for really good dumpling here since it's called dumpling king but the XLB has a weird sour taste to it... Maybe that's the style? But didn't enjoy it and I've tried a lot of XLB elsewhere.

Beef noodle soup - nothing specially, edible, meh.

Cumin lamb - this was really good! Without this dish maybe I would've given it a 2 star.

We had left over for the first 2 dishes and it wasn't really worth bringing home.",3
1546259,ciRqlFDXjAy06jvZ5cEJHg,8T4aPvtpugzUxJc-DVrLHg,"Dumplings here were $9.99 for 10 small dumplings. Skin was perfect, meat was good but broth was lacking. There just wasn't enough of it.",3
1546260,N0GLiqr9-Qu-Whl2tfhmpw,8T4aPvtpugzUxJc-DVrLHg,Dumpling King is Amazing!! Very clean and great service and even better food!! This will be my new place for great Chinese food.,5
1546261,A8TZ5pQNxPv0of1mZD2_IQ,8T4aPvtpugzUxJc-DVrLHg,"I came here for take out recently and upon entering the restaurant my eyes burst from the bright floral patterned seat covers. They were a bit of an eyesore. As for the rest of the restaurant, it was cutely arranged with round tables and red Chinese lanterns lining the ceilings. They were playing old school Christmas songs which got me in a cheery mood whilst waiting.

I ordered the soup dumplings and the fried string beans. I was hoping for them to be big portions for the amount I paid, which was $20 for two dishes. 

So the verdict: 
The dumplings were ok and hardened as soon as they started to cool down. The green beans were seasoned nicely and was a good portion but the down side was how greasy they were. 

I'm willing to give this place another shot I didn't really love what I had.",3
1546262,7j1nARVuXFB0O280cZA65Q,8T4aPvtpugzUxJc-DVrLHg,"Amazing food! Choose basically anything and it will be awesome! Favorites included the Eggplant, Black Pepper Beef, Soup dumplings, well really any and all of the dumplings. Just close your eyes and point, it will be good, and authentic, if that's not what your after you can still find something that you'll like, but really it's the authenticity of flavored that shine.",5
1546263,gj_5TK_IbniUqutOEiqzCA,8T4aPvtpugzUxJc-DVrLHg,"0 star. Waited 30 min for beef dumplings, by the time we finished the other two dishes, was told they were out of beef. Food is ok if you can stand the wait",1
1546264,lwV9RXBv0RZgqdUlXChA7A,8T4aPvtpugzUxJc-DVrLHg,"First time to this spot...figured I would try some dumplings out...

Decor was as expected...felt like I got slapped by a huge Chinese floral pattern upon entering...

Ordered the beef stew noodle (not too bad...China Mama is better)...

Since this is the dumpling king...you would figure their dumplings would be amaze-balls but wrong! Mediocre at best...and I've had plenty of dumplings to compare this to...ordered the shrimp chive ones (blah)...

Overall, worth the try not definitely not worth coming to again...perhaps if they make better dumplings!!",3
1547735,ANiVL-pZQuC8Pl1KtOwCpA,kiA-L7r9uHh2bqUPxuCzNQ,"I decided to give the Oriental House a try because it's close to my house and am i glad i did. WHAT NICE FRIENDLY PEOPLE!! upon entering we were immediately greeted by one of the owners Barbara. She runs it with her husband Max and ""Momma Jean"" is the main chef. Oriental House just opened a few weeks ago however, these owners are NOT new to the restaurant world. They owned many famous eateries over 30 years including ""Pata"" on Wilshire in Beverly Hills and ""Chitra"".    

When you walk in, the ambiance is very spacious and modern. i like the decor all around the room. the restaurant is very clean and the customer service is A-1.

Now lets talk about the menu. Easily over ONE HUNDRED items to choose from!!  
Everything from Lemon Grass Chicken to Chaba noodle soup, Shanghai clay pot, Indian curry soup, Hawaiian fried rice, Japanese creamy curry, LOTS of Vegetarian choices and deserts included Fried bananas or Mango with sticky rice. I can't wait to try them all!

Side note: They do not sell alcohol (yet). But will introduce beer and wine on the menu soon!

Do yourself a favor and visit The Oriental House.",5
1547736,eY0JzbLw-v8FFqVJ59IF5Q,kiA-L7r9uHh2bqUPxuCzNQ,"My friends and I decided to try this place out for my birthday dinner a few days ago. Being teenagers, the main thing we looked for besides the food, was the service, since at other restaurants, we were treated differently being at a somewhat young age. However, the owner's wife, our server as well, was very kind to us, and was even so generous enough to give us free Thai iced teas. Now food wise, I give it an 11/10, it was that good. We all got something from the noodles section and it was delicious, along with a few appetizers. Their service is great and their prices are a bit on the $$, but it's okay for the amount of food they give, which is something to come back for. Overall, our experience here so far was great and I'll be glad to recommend this place to my other friends and family.",4
1547737,XwNgUhJeLVL9kVioW7xN-g,kiA-L7r9uHh2bqUPxuCzNQ,"The food was really good but the service was exceptional.  I love family owned restaurants for that reason! They are very attentive to your needs.  My daughter has many allergies and they were able to navigate with me what she could have and couldn't have.  I have been to many restaurants and as soon as I tell them she has an allergy, I get the look , ""why are you eating out, eat at home?"" But at this restaurant I got the empathetic look and she made sure we were taken care of! They were all so friendly and checked up on us frequently.  My husband hates when our drinks are not filled and it was always filled.  This restaurant is also kid friendly.  They were very attentive to my kids and Uncle Peter even got my daughter to take more bites of her food :) You rarely get this kind of service any where and if they continue to do what they do, exceptional service and great food, they will definitely be successful in this business world! Thank you to Barbara, Uncle Peter and Momma Jean for everything tonight! We will be back!",5
1547738,EKqWjt5lBXPryn-ZQvdfmQ,kiA-L7r9uHh2bqUPxuCzNQ,"Extremely friendly staff! I've been there about 3 times already. The food isn't too salty or oily. The place is clean and neat. From observing, I can tell that they really try and make sure their guests feel comfortable. Definitely going back again!",4
1547739,xgV19-fM2nA_EROE20uiwQ,kiA-L7r9uHh2bqUPxuCzNQ,It's all a matter of opinion. Great service and good food. The owner knows how to make you feel welcome.,5
1547740,pdNqpb8o2MJ3Vnnt4EUFbA,kiA-L7r9uHh2bqUPxuCzNQ,"This will be a two part and two rating review.

First, aside from the food, I have to say that the service was very friendly. The server  attended us well, and made several suggestions, and as Audrey S. said, the owner makes you feel welcome. That was very positive.

Now a review of what we go out for, the food.

We decided to start out with a Spring Roll appetizer. The server recommended the Fresh Asian Roll instead. It was a good idea. It is nothing like the quality Spring Rolls you get at Pho So 1, or Pho Saigon 8, but it was light and refreshing. 

I am on a diet, so I ordered a Chicken Salad. The menu said it was fried chicken. I asked the server if I could have it grilled. She accomodated me. It was very fresh, and light for a summer meal, but it really wasn't very Asian. It was simply a Thin cut chicken breast, on top of a bed of Ice Berg Lettuce, with cucumbers and tomatoes on the side. Not much presentation. Fresh and good for a diet, but not what I expected from a Thai Chinese place. I did give it 3 stars.

My wife ordered the Wanton and Noodle Soup. The bowl was small, and only a few Wanton. There was a ton of noodles, but she said they were over cooked, and she didn't even finish half of the portion. Rating 1 star.

Two stars means ""I've experienced better"", and this holds true for this place. If you are on a diet, go here for a clean salad. It's pricey for a small portion, but you'll feel better doing this, than pigging out at Sweet Tomatoes. 

However, if you're looking for good Thai or Chinese food, do your sense of eating adventure a favor, and go somewhere else.",2
1547741,MkGQLg0tMLpo9ChLQ8olpg,kiA-L7r9uHh2bqUPxuCzNQ,"My husband been wanting to try this place & I'm super glad we did!! They deliver great customer service.

Our server was Peter, turns out to be owner. We had great conversations from where his restaurant first started and owns at other places. 


Food - omg.. food presentation is gourmet and the food is very delish! You can taste the authentic spices and ingredients. Also, very fresh!!!!

Peter also gave me the courtesy to try the curry bowl w rice and complimentary house Salad for my husband and I. Also, made our little one try ice cream.

I recommend this place with a 5 star!! Definitely will be coming back. 

They deliver thee best food and creates clientele relationships & I love it!!!",5
1547742,E_syNlTsrYJwruPID_BaHQ,kiA-L7r9uHh2bqUPxuCzNQ,"Just tried Oriental House for the first time and was very impressed. It serves a market for fresh, authentic Asian cuisine that is otherwise under served in the neighborhood. You won't find anything really unfamiliar on the menu, but you will find light and flavorful preparations of favorites from Chinese, Thai, and Vietnamese menus. The room is spacious and modern, the prices are right and the service is some of the best I have experienced. The restaurant is family owned and operated, and they make an extraordinary effort to meet their guests and even solicit feedback. I would recommend Oriental House to anyone interested in a casual Asian dining experience without the hustle and bustle of Chinatown. I'm looking forward to returning soon and trying different dishes from various regions...and I won't be afraid to ask (co-owner/manager/server) Barbara for input as she is more than happy to help :)",5
1547743,AX5EBWZQ8hnv-EAXb6LaGQ,kiA-L7r9uHh2bqUPxuCzNQ,"My girlfriend came here with her mom, and thought it was so good that she had to bring me. I'm here to say that I'm glad she did! Though we were the only two in the restaurant, the service did not suffer. They were very attentive, and friendly as well! I had the Cashew Nut Chicken and my girlfriend had the Asian Noodles. Both came out in great time and were very tasty! The way their spice orders work, mild medium and spicy, are quite accurate. I had mine medium and it was just as I expected! I highly recommend coming here either for a great lunch it dinner.",5
1547744,MGZ5hFzc0zx0doMNZ77FOw,kiA-L7r9uHh2bqUPxuCzNQ,"I have been craving pad Thai lately and trying different spots in my area. This one so far has been my favorite. The Asian noodle as the call it, is pad Thai and so delicious. The spice level and amount of sauce is right where it should be. I have been twice in a week which is a testimony to the delicious noodles they have. They have a very large menu and the restaurant is always quiet. I am sad that this restaurant is empty when I come because it deserves recognition! The owners are here and the wait staff is very friendly! She gave me two 10% off cards to use on my next visits. Come here if you want a large selection of all delicious Asian food.",5
1547745,50YKgLibte0KL4m5Mn_U_g,kiA-L7r9uHh2bqUPxuCzNQ,We tried for first time tonight. Great food and service we tried several different menu items and all were fresh and tasted delicious. We will for sure go back and everyone must try highly recommended,5
1547746,HiWNFyghOg1_7Q1BDbkZ3g,kiA-L7r9uHh2bqUPxuCzNQ,"Food is very tasty, very focused on flavor, not one sauce for all. I can taste on each flavors. Support local new business. Clean, friendly, and welcome environment. The correction of number is 702-550-4262.",5
1547747,QRwDvmVdjbSo-0VvomsUFw,kiA-L7r9uHh2bqUPxuCzNQ,They make their own sauce so you can get sugar free.  If you like spice order Thai hot ;). Ginger perfect is always a favorite.  Trying Spicy Ground Chicken toady.  Smells wonderful!,4
1547748,XPZ9ojHIDntp2X-yysmJYg,kiA-L7r9uHh2bqUPxuCzNQ,"It will take no time at all to notice how nice the people are here. They told us they used to run a business in Virginia for decades doing the same thing! How cool! If their menu is the same as in Virginia, it would explain the white-washing I'll be describing.

The menu is massive. It's mostly Thai food, with a smattering of other cultures here and there. There are too many choices. Overwhelming! Eventually, it was settled to get some classics:

- Spicy eggplant and basil with chicken. This was ordered at a medium level of spiciness, but came out as mild. Sauce-heavy and flavor-light. It has the right basil flavor in the sauce, but it's just too much liquid and not enough ingredients. Quality of everything included was stellar, though! Nothing was overcooked. White meat chicken, fresh eggplant, good basil.

- Lemongrass chicken. This was also at a medium level of spiciness according to them, but really just mild. Very saucy, with light lemongrass flavor. This is unusually light because of all the lemongrass present. Again, the same chicken, fresh bell peppers and carrots. Thankfully, cooked just enough to keep crispiness. Quality, but small in portion.

- Complimentary salad with house dressing. This was a simple salad topped with a honey-sesame oil-tomato dressing made in-house. Yum!

Get the gist? Saucy, mild, fresh, small portioned, and yet expensive. About $11-12 a plate. This is just too much, unfortunately. I would have expected a much larger dish without compromising the quality and integrity of the ingredients.

Coming back here would be easy at the right price, even without the ""authenticity"" I'm used to in some other Thai-oriented spots in town. But until then, I'm hesitant. Quality and service is spot-on, but the price point just kills it.",3
1547749,GCNMuWjMTPuscr2NmZ947Q,kiA-L7r9uHh2bqUPxuCzNQ,"Stopped by on 7-12-2014 by chance after simply seeing the sign driving by.  Anything with the term fusion is typically a turn off to us as we are traditional.  So glad we stopped.

We ordered papaya salad that was to dye for...summer rolls were crisp and fresh...fish with curry sauce and the chefs special chicken.  Three side salads with house dressing came along.  With only two entrees, feed three of us and we were all licking our lips.  The ladies finished with fresh mango with sticky rice for desert.  

Two major points.  1) This is truly a Mom and Pop's place which we really prefer...mainly for the cooking but also for rewarding hard working people.  2)  Thai food made without MSG and made perfectly to taste is HUGE.  Too often it is either full of additives or Americanized to the point of lost flavor.

Great service, very clean atmosphere, YUMMY food.  Great formula for return customers.  Highly recommend....see ya there!",5
1547750,hqC-E4mub0xVxTbd2bKPrg,kiA-L7r9uHh2bqUPxuCzNQ,"YUM!! The service was super friendly that you forget your in Vegas!! The owner is always our server and he is GREAT!! He will change up your meal to add anything you want. Ask for the BBQ pork fried rice - it is not on the menu (fried rice is - just not the bbq pork)  but they will make it and its fantastic! I always get the asain noodles - its pad thai but better. Also you must try the ground chicken, to die for!!!",5

The spicy crispy duck was like nothing we'd ever tasted before, and so was the seafood in clear noodles.

1547756,4tCwCOqOtivkbfe0IZug8A,kiA-L7r9uHh2bqUPxuCzNQ,"A nice family owned and operated restaurant. I ordered the Green Curry. It was good, but not the best I've had here in town. It's a little on the pricey side as well. 

I did enjoy the customer service though. The owner struck up a friendship with me and offered for me to visit him when he retires and goes back home 

I'd usually give 3 stars for the food, but adding an extra star because I like the people",4

First thing we noticed was the outstanding customer service. It's family owned/run and it shows in all aspects of the service we received. The Food was equally exceptional as well. I ordered the dumplings and the duck noodle soup and both turned out really great. Everything is handmade (and hence the higher price than usual), and it shows in the quality of their food. 

We will definitely be back!",5

The dining room was nice and comfortable yet still casual.  The staff was very friendly and clearly proud of the restaurant and the menu.  Highly recommended.",5
1547760,8455Y2pN7t-nfSx4FuXyCw,kiA-L7r9uHh2bqUPxuCzNQ,"Our new favorite!

Peter is the sweetest.

We had a variety of dishes last night including red coconut curry, Singapore noodles, summer rolls, and salad. Everything was perfect!

The atmosphere in the restaurant is lovely.

It's a big menu so there's something for everyone to enjoy.

Tip: if you like spicy (I usually like medium), order it a bit less spicy than usual just in case. 

This is going to be our new hangout. Enjoy!",5

Entries were the Hawaiian fried rice, the Japanese curry, the vegetable curry, and ginger chicken.  Everyone loved their order.   The Thai tea was well prepared.  One recommendation for desert: try the mango and sticky rice.  This is a hidden gem.  Enjoy while few people know about it.  Warning: They are closed on Sunday.",5
1547762,0sUfnr3bgE-sf3ue48XrRw,kiA-L7r9uHh2bqUPxuCzNQ,"All 3 things I got were horrible. Mango sticky rice had nasty white goop for sauce instead of coconut milk, and the rice was not prepared properly. Basil eggplant chicken was way oily and bland. Basil beef fried rice was cheap on beef, vegetables, and basil. Never coming here again.",1
1547763,r_mymdVG8xMAQ79kdddFGQ,kiA-L7r9uHh2bqUPxuCzNQ,So me and the wifey were craving Thai so we gave this new place a shot. What a waste the food sucked we had the basil/beef fried rice. Damn they wee cheap on the vegetables and the beef! The dish was mostly rice! Also had the mango sticky rice that thing looked like soup the rice was salty had to dump the sauce out. The only good thing was the mango. We had take out otherwise I would have returned everything!,1

I had the spicy linguini, and if you like spicy food this place will hook it up. Also the owners were so nice and friendly! The gave us some salads on the house and were just very courteous. My beverage was never empty. All my friends really enjoyed their meals and the price was extremely decent. We ended the meal with some delicious fried ice cream. Definitely recommend this place! :-)",5

Compared to some places the portions could be bigger BUT the food is very high quality and they will happily alter any dish the way you prefer.

I started with the curry puffs. Delicious! The dipping sauce was good and the cucumber pieces had designs carved into the skin. Nice touch.

This was followed by a ginger dressed salad which tasted as if they'd made it themselves. I make my own ginger dressing and theirs was very good.

For my entree I had the Ginger Perfect [chicken] but also wanted the spicy basil. We settled on spicing up the ginger perfect and it was, in a word, perfect! I like spicy & delicious.

Washed it all down with a thai tea [no boba] and plenty water as it was hot and caffeine can dehydrate.

It was a perfect meal. They are very attentive and treat people as if they never meet a stranger. Genuinely warm folks serving good food. I can't wait to return, I'm making myself hungry just typing this!",5

I ordered the following - all of which were tasty and delicious.... 1) Spring Roll, 2) Dumplings, 3) Satay Chicken, 4) Wonton Soup, 5) China Connection, 6) Mango w/ Sticky Rice..... I suggest all of those meals, as they were exceptional! I really loved the sauces on each dish! Everything impressed me and I will be back at this restaurant very often!",5

And I'm so glad we did!! We ordered takeout and I had the asian noodles with tofu (pad thai) while my fiancé had the garlic and black pepper beef. Both were delicious, fresh, and full of flavor! The asian noodles had the perfect amount of spice to it and wasn't oily (compared to other restaurants) and the sauce from the garlic and black pepper beef was amazing! Oh and service was excellent, even for takeout! The woman at the register was very kind and really knows how to make you feel welcome. I find that most asian restaurants lack in service, but definitely not this place! I can't wait to come back and try other items on the menu!",5

I ordered the steamed dumplings similar to a shu-Mai . I got the chicken with Basil and added brocolli and it was the best sauce and made with white meat chicken, no mystery meat! I ate the whole plate.
Simply great food great service with a heart! Let keep this family business in the neighborhood!",5

The thai food is delicious and one of the best on this side of town.

1547781,FKouCaaKH6KTHsdtWu2o_Q,kiA-L7r9uHh2bqUPxuCzNQ,"The menu at Oriental House is overwhelming with plenty of Chinese, Thai, and Japanese options. They would benefit from a more streamlined selection of dishes to focus on what they do best. What that is, I don't know. The satay chicken ($7.95) was a good portion for the price with about five skewers. The Kowloon noodles ($9.95) were decent. While light on chicken, the flat noodles with broccoli and bean sprouts in a black sauce were decent but seemed to be flavored for the more mild palate of western taste buds.

We got the Pho and Ramen, and although not ""traditional"" tasting (my pho had some spices in there that I don't normally get at Viet Pho places), they were both *delicious*. And the Thai Iced Tea was the best I've ever had. Peter, the owner/waiter, was so friendly and nice. The restaurant was cozy and thoughtfully decorated. This is a hidden gem and we will definitely put this on our list of favorite places to eat near our house!",5

Was the first cold day in Vegas off the fall, so tried a duck ramen dish that for like 8 bucks was worth twice that. Hot green tea for a drink and friendly conversation with the owner(s). Definitely will go back.",5
1547786,8AjTJ9XOD262MOPBDetORA,kiA-L7r9uHh2bqUPxuCzNQ,"Experience:  I came with some friends to try this place. It has both Chinese and Thai food. The menu is huge, so it's difficult to choose. 

Food:  we had about 10 people, so I was able to taste many things on the menu.  I did but taste one dish I did not like.  Everything was very good. 
I ordered the duck eggrolls which were very tasty.  Then I had the pork fried rice made spicy.  I asked for an 8 out of 10 on the hot scale and it was perfect for me.  

Service: The waiter was super friendly and good at playful banter. He was very attentive and made suggestions where needed. 

Facility: pretty small, but perfect for this casual establishment. It was pretty empty, but that just meant great service for us. 

Overall review: I would come back here. The service and food were good.",4

The owner of the restaurant spent some time talking to us, which was really nice, and he is a great person. Food was done quickly and we devoured everything. It was just delicious. We ordered Won ton soup, spicy noodles and tangerine chicken--everything gone. Just great. We plan on making this our regular go-to spot.",5

1547789,vqbFdjCQ8OwRHxVFNcDQ0A,kiA-L7r9uHh2bqUPxuCzNQ,"This place does have a weird mixture of food. Between the two times I have come here I have had thai beef salad, pho, atlantic noodles, eggplant tofu, ragoons, thai tea, and mango sticky rice. It was all decent, but nothing that blew me away. The ragoons could use more filling. My favorite was probably the atlantic noodles (if you like seafood) and I do love the mango sticky rice. 

It would have a decent atmosphere except every time I go it is a ghost town, as in completely empty except for me and my boyfriend. It is a little awkward to eat in an empty restaurant, but hey at least it is quite. 

I will probably be back again. The owner is pretty accommodating, he really wants to make his customers happy. We got free house salads last time which was awesome because the dressing they use is really unique. I liked them a lot. Their menu is huge so it is really just a matter of finding your favorite thing.",4

We had a large party of 13 people and after she said she wanted Asian cuisine we called around the Summerlin area for a place to accommodate us.  We all met here at 5pm on a Friday and were a little scared that we were the only ones in the restaurant. We were greeted by an older gentlemen who sat us down and immediately took our drink order. We had 6 kids with us so it's hard to sit at a restaurant for a long time. The waiter was very prompt with the food. Everything we ordered was fresh and hot and tasted great. You can bring your own cake for after dinner too. They get their liquor license next month so we will coming here a lot more often. The menu is so vast and the service was great.,4

1548246,2RQPXLz1Xfez4IND3SrShw,O5BaxsfXVo7kwX1YnjyvzA,"Tonight was our first time here at this new restaurant. We ordered:

~Napa sautéed with dried shrimp
~Hot & Spicy Pork Intestine & Sliced fish in Clay Pot
~Smoked duck
~Whole red snapper in chef's special hot sauce
~Chinese eggplant in garlic sauce
~Szechuan style bean curd (with minced beef)
~Chunk of chicken in spicy sauce
~Minced pork with translucent noodle

Fair warning: this is NOT an oil-free meal. Most of the dishes we ordered were soaked in chili oil, but that is Szechuan cuisine.

All the dishes were great, but my favorites were the napa, smoked duck, egg plant, and translucent noodle.

The red snapper dish is actual tilapia. 

Overall, great place for authentic Szechuan cuisine!",4
1548247,3niBYIZS6Xo8tvvaFUdLEQ,O5BaxsfXVo7kwX1YnjyvzA,"Food here was good. Really can not complain. But it was a little pricey for chinese food in my opinion. Especially because the portions were kinda small. 

Service was ok. If you could get their attention they were very friendly and helpful. The problem there lies in getting their attention. There were only two tables when I was there (ours and one other), yet it still took for ever to get someone to look our way. They seemed to be always preoccupied either staring back into the kitchen or just staring out the window.

Overall it was still ok. Decent food.",4

I got appetizers that they put out in the front to let people see what it is, (I got pig ears, cucumbers, and chicken) which were really fresh. I also got two other dishes containing beef and fish submerged in this spicy broth. I always crave the fish and since this restaurant specializes in szechuan cooking, what the heck. I honestly was not disappointed. 

The server was really nice too! She checked back with my family in a timely manner and I really appreciated it.",5
1548250,qAV1_b7Ivd71Eoe0UAy0Pg,O5BaxsfXVo7kwX1YnjyvzA,"I gotta say I was really surprised by the quality of the food here. It's fresh, it's delicious, it's amazing! Okay, amazing was taking it a little too far because not everything on the menu was as awesome as I thought, but most of everything I ordered were awesome - and did I say fresh already? Lol. Price-wise, I'd say average. This is not fast-food Chinese like Rice and Noodles (I also love that place to death because they always make my ""special requests"" perfectly), so you can't compare the price to that. However, compared to the prices of say, KJ Kitchen, the more authentic and popular Chinese restaurant in Vegas, then the prices is about the same. You guys know what I'm talking about if you really do dig Chinese food. 

Both my experience there was really good. The waitresses mostly spoke English (quite well too), and were extremely helpful and nice. I'd go there again just for beers and their cold dishes. Cold dishes are popular as an appetizer to Chinese people, but I've rarely ever tasted fresh ones since I was little. So I kind of grew up disliking it. I'm always afraid of tasting that stale, expired taste in cold dishes. But not at this restaurant! Their cold dishes are fresh!!

So far, I have nothing but good things to say about this restaurant. I love this place so far.",5

The Lo Mein Noodles were nice and fat with hearty vegetables while the Fried Rice was a little blah with little color or veggies.

Garlic Chicken had some nice heat while the Kung Po Chicken lacked heat. Vegetables were plentiful providing good overall taste. 

Orange Chicken, Salty Chicken along with Beef N Broccoli all were stand up with great bit size pieces and flavors. 

Black Pepper Chicken is the overall star for this restaurant! Bite size pieces without too much pepper which some restaurants fail to monitor. There is a hint of sweet in the Black Pepper Chicken that makes me want to go back for more. If you have a person or child who is hesitant on trying Chinese food. This may be the item to order that may change their mind.",4

Unfortunately, I tried the Chow Mein, Fried Rice, and Orange Chicken and was disappointed. The breading on the orange chicken was excessive. 

It feels like more of a burger spot, because of the seating and décor. I didn't feel like I was in a restaurant that serves Chinese food. I might go again to try other entrees, but no future visits planned for the near future.",2

She got orange chicken, kung pao chicken, and I think the black pepper chicken. She was very pleased with all of the entrees she had. I finished up the orange chicken today, two days later. It was delish! Not overly breaded and a nice, distinct orange flavor. She called my roommate at home to see if she wanted anything, so we also pucked up the $4.99 two entree special with double sweet and sour chicken and fried rice, which they made fresh for her order. The portion was so big, our lovely server could hardly close the container. My roommate was very happy with her order and said the sweet and sour chicken was really good, along with that freshly made fried rice. It was a bargain for the price.

Black pepper chicken and beef w/broccoli with fried rice and I added 3 crab rangoons for $1. The black pepper chicken was excellent...not overly breaded, and it was crispy right down to the last bite. The sauce was outstanding! The beef with broccoli was also very good, the beef was tender and the broccoli still had a nice snap to it. In fact, all the veggies in both entrees were wonderful, not overcooked at all. The crab rangoons were a bargain for the price. They stayed nice and crispy as well. They had a new lady working there, who was very nice and very enthusiastic about the food and the level of service. Don't pass this up. Everyone has to get their sea legs and their rhythm in the restaurant business and I think they are on their way to being very successful!!! Great job!

When I left I checked the she sign did not say anything about ""before 3pm"". So there are you standing there ready to eat some food and you just order anyway. I did not really appreciate the bait and switch scam crap. The portions were decent although the food was kind of bland.

1556159,HpP1HXlMLZ0Sa7TeKmIRVw,J6rIkpGl2ZipFDd5zk4Nzw,"Heard about this place from a friend who had tried it a few days prior and said it was AMAZING authentic Taiwanese food ! 

This restaurant took over the Shan Dong restaurant that used to be here. Kind of hidden by a huge tree, to the right (North) of Boutique World 

NOTE: CASH ONLY ! ! ! ! ! !

The menu says ""Authentic Szechuan Cuisine for 50 years"". To clarify, its not the Szechuan from China. As we were told by the waitress, the chef is from Taiwan and cooks authentic Taiwanese ""Chuan Cai"" which means village food/cuisine. 

Not familiar with taiwanese style foods, and it being lunch, my friend and I ordered from the lunch specials. All lunch combos served with 1 vegetable egg roll, steamed rice (or brown rice), daily vegetable (....wait what? i just noticed that LOL) and soup. 

$4.25 combo - ma po tofu, sauteed cabbage, glass noodle with minced pork, or scrambled eggs with tomato
$5.75 combo - shredded pork with bean curd, shredded beef with bell pepper, chicken with garlic sauce, or sliced pork belly with bell peppers
$6.95 combo - shrimp with scrambled eggs, shrimp with broccoli, beef with bean curd, or beef with mushroom

Not a bad selection amount for lunch. Lots of food. Maybe restaurant isn't too known yet and it recently opened so not busy at all. Food came out pretty fast. 

The soup was a hot and sour soup. Strong on the white pepper. My friend didnt like it but i liked it. Normally dont order/get this soup. XD but it was pretty good. 

Shredded pork with bean curd - decent amount. lots of bean curd. flavored well. 

Sliced pork belly with bell peppers - lots of veggies vs pork belly. A bit on the salty side (for me). Not bad (salty wise) eaten with rice. 

Vegetable Egg Roll - not a fan of vegetable egg rolls but it was freshly fried. Hot and crispy skin. Vegetable........ yeah not a fan of that part. Lol 

Overall, not bad. Good deal for lunch. Would like to come back to try what my friend had gotten to see how it is. Apparently totally ordered the wrong things.",3
1556160,s3zatQ1KM7VgEeesK0g9zg,J6rIkpGl2ZipFDd5zk4Nzw,"This Taiwanese restaurant has been open only for a week! It's very clean and the servers are knowledgable and courteous. 
We ordered the chef special which is the beef noodle soup. It has a hint of spiciness and the soup is warm and delicious in an interesting way--- I'm so used to Japanese ramen and Vietnamese pho-- so this Taiwanese version will take a while getting used to. The beef is obviously cooked in a slow fire and the cut is lean but flavorful  (not  fatty nor full of ligaments compared to other places I've tried before). I wish they have sriracha on the table to adjust the spiciness. My husband and I shared the big bowl and were really full and satisfied :) We also tried the fish fillet in bean paste as recommended by our very energetic server. It is sea bass filet, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The bean paste & chili sauce compliment the mild flavor of the fish. And boy, their serving is huge. We got 2 filets that could feed a family of 6!!! I also like that you have a choice of brown or white rice (I chose the brown rice and it has such a delicious chewy nutty flavor!) Overall, I like the experience and will definitely come back to try their other dishes esp the crab & spicy shrimp.",4

1556162,mE3KkoYunvIlhdIRnTVo2Q,J6rIkpGl2ZipFDd5zk4Nzw,"This is my second visit to this newly opened Taiwanese restaurant and I'm pretty satisfied by most dishes that I've tried. On their store sign, it says ""小胖川菜"" which means ""Little Fattie's Szechuan"" However, if you look at the menu, you would know this is not a Szechuan restaurant rather than a Taiwanese restaurant. 

Food

1. Fish Fillet in Bean Paste: This was one of my favorite dish from this place although I'm confused by the name of this dish. I did not taste any bean flavor in there. To me, it taste more like garlic sauce. Fish (white fish) is deep fried and soaked in this yummy sauce of theirs. 

2. Spicy Fire Pot with Pork Intestine: This dish comes with intestine and tofu.I like this dish very much as well. Only thing lacking in this dish is the pig blood cake/duck blood cake. Other than that, it has an pretty authentic taste. 

3. Chicken in Garlic Sauce: It comes with chicken, woodears, and a special type of potato that I don't know what it is called. Chicken was tender and the sauce was flavorful. 

4. Squid in three cup sauce: This dish was just okay to me because I like a lot of basil in the three cup sauce. I did not taste too much of basil in there. 

5. Braised Eggplant with Garlic Sauce: Flavor was great and eggplant was cooked just right. 

6. Rice with meat sauce: The meat sauce it self was yummy but I didn't like their steam rice. It was not moist but rather dry. Hopefully they will change to different brand of rice. 

7. Chinese meatballs (Lion Heads): It was not too flavorful. It was the least favorite among of our group. 

8. Roast Pork Hocks: It was flavorful but the meat was not that fresh that day. I can taste the ""piggy smell"" lol. It was also not our favorite among of our group. 

9. Glass noodle with spicy minced pork: This dish is okay for me as well. I like the sauce and the spiciness but the noodle was bit under cooked in my opinion. 

10. Beef Noodle Soup: Beef was tender but soup was not flavorful enough and I didn't like the yellow noodle that they put in there. 

I also like the complementary side dishes that we got the other day. We had cucumbers, seaweed salad, peanuts and bean spouts. 

Service was decent and attentive. I have been going twice since last weekend and plan on going back again this week. I will keep trying other entrees and keep you all posted!",4
1556163,JuIVrHZylCO3qUWaLNPWhQ,J6rIkpGl2ZipFDd5zk4Nzw,"I went here the other night with my friend who grew up in China. One of my other friends highly reccommended this place and said it was authentic Taiwanese food. Of course, I had to go and try it! My friend likes to order lots of food. I told her to pick whatever she wants because she has good tastes, so I have no idea what she ordered. Haha.  We had hot and sour soup, eggplants with something, 3 cup chicken, and fish filet with bean paste. I wasn't a fan of the 3 cup chicken. The flavoring was a bit weird maybe it was because they put too much basil.  I loved the eggplant and the fish filet. It was so awesome! The eggplant was very refreshing and very delicious. The fish filet was so awesome! It was huge too! I was stuffed because I ate so much!

I did have an issue with my credit card. I got a notification (I get text alerts everytime my credt card is charge), and I got charged twice. They also overcharged. We split the bill, and they charged me $5 more. They fixed refunded me one of the charges and charged me the right price. On their end, it only showed one charge. They did tell us to come back if the charge did show up on my cc. They did call my friend a few days later (She left her number) and asked if I had been overcharged which was nice of them.  

The servers were very attentive, and I liked the fact that they let us stay past closing and did not try to kick us out. And it was very sweet of them to call to check if I was overcharged.",4

Staff speaks primarily Mandarin though (4) value: their food lacks wok hai and flavor depth, but considering the level of service a 2.5 star place with bump up to 3.

I was jonesing for some good Taiwanese beef noodle soup after a long road trip diet of Mickey D's. We used to frequent Taiwan Kitchen which sadly closed. So we've been on the prowl for some good Taiwanese eats.

We came in and were promptly given menus. Unfortunately, there were some communication snafus (I don't speak Mandarin and the hubs is non fluent) but the service was friendly and really good for a small joint this size.

We ordered a bowl of beef noodle soup, stir fried tofu and braised eggplant. I think due to a communication problem, we got the garlic eggplant instead.

They started us off with some free cold dishes - a house pickled daikon and a garlic cucumber dish. I enjoyed the crunch of the sweet/sour slightly spicy daikon. The cucumbers were also very refreshing.

The beef noodle soup was disappointing. The soup base didn't have enough beefy aroma and tasted slightly like powdered bouillon. The noodles were slightly overcooked for my taste. The beef was tender enough and the serving size is large.

The eggplant dish was okay with a good sear to the eggplant. Unfortunately, there was too much goopy sauce in the dish which I wasn't a huge fan of. 

The tofu had the same issue with the addition of not having enough wok hai. It was stir fried with carrots and snow peas which was weird to me. The dish was on the bland side.

Overall, the food is kinda meh and I don't have a strong urge to return. Serving sizes are generous here so you won't leave hungry. 2.5 stars with a bump up to 3 for the excellent service.",3

They make the noodles from scratch in the back so it's fresh right when you get it. You definitely are getting more than what you paid for with the portions compared to some other restaurants.

Glass noodles with minced pork - Had for the first time tonight and it's very simple but very flavorful.

Garlic stir-fry of seasonal vegetables - This dish is pretty standard in all asian restaurants, nothing special but solid dish nonetheless.

Tofu stir fry with eggplant - I didn't care too much for this dish, a bit light in flavor for me.

Mapo Tofu - Classic tofu dish that's very tasty.

Hidden away so doesn't have the overcrowded feeling when you go into Chinese restaurants nearby.

1559709,K75M5X8RRWjK5vNAnyU-dg,Lo99HExahVguUC512OvMwg,"I came with high hope for this place because the chef came from a previous Chinese restaurant where I really really enjoyed his cooking. However, I left pretty disappointed after our visit here. If it's not for the taro/yam balls with tofu pudding dessert, I would give 2.5 stars. 

When you first walk in, you will see a buffet line at the left where you can pick two or three items combo. It came with either rice or yam porridge depending upon your preference. I tried two different type of bamboo shoots, roast pork belly, roast pork and tomato with eggs for the combination. We also ordered dry pork (pork sung),crispy intestine and spicy stinky tofu on the side. Besides crispy intestine was not bad, everything else was like 2 out of 5. The small dish of dry pork (pork sung) was $5 which we found it so ridiculous. We were fairly unsatisfied and disappointed. 

Till we got our dessert tofu pudding with taro/yam balls, I was semi happy with the meal again. The taro and yam balls are nice and chewy, pretty comparable to Meet Fresh. 

As far as service, most Asian places have pretty terrible services I have to say. This place was not an exception. This one young guy works in there seemed like he doesn't want to be there. He also seemed very impatient every time we asked him for stuff. 

I think I might come back and try their beef noodle soup and other dessert in the future. On the side note, they sell ramen which I found it odd.",3

Won't be as good as the authentic ones in TW, but at least you can taste a piece of feeling here in town.",3

I was dying to try to mala stinky tofu but they didn't have any :( :( I guess they have to get the ingredients from further and isn't always available, so i'll make sure to call next time to double check. Other than that, the food was good to me.

Honestly in Chinatown, we shouldn't expect any type of customer service. At least the girl at cashier was smiling...

I appreciate the fact that they put pictures of food on the menu. When I see the name and its description, it's not as appealing to me. After looking at the menu, I decided to order Three Cups of Chicken Rice (or something similar to that) which came with marinated chicken, rice and some veggies. Chicken was too salty for my taste and was dry. I also noticed there were a lot of tiny bones in there. 

My friend ordered Pork Belly Rice and it was pretty good. Pork belly rice also came with rice and veggies. Pork belly had a good flavor and was very juicy and tender. I should have ordered this considering how dry my chicken was. 

I noticed they have varieties of ramen. Can't remember exactly but had a lot of options. Sora ramen is my go-to place for ramen but might be interesting to try it here. Restaurant is empty so you definitely don't have to wait to get in like Sora!

Looking at other yelp reviews, they have pudding dessert which I did not see on the menu. I would go back to this place to try that pudding dessert.",3

We did their $7.99 special of 3 dishes and porridge (if you've read my other reviews you'll know I'm mostly paleo so I ordered the porridge aka congee for the other ppl at the table).

So what you do is go further into the restaurant and choose the dishes (on the left) that you want and then have a seat.  I wanted two meat dishes and was told that I could only get 1, so it's 1 meat and 2 veggies.  So I got the braised chicken drumsticks, cabbage and bamboo shoots.  There were 3 pieces of chopped drumstick which probably made up of one full drumstick, the favor was spot on on what braised Taiwanese meat should taste like so that was good but man I was still hungry after the meal.  The cabbage was ok, typical veggie dish and the bamboo shoots were bla.  My mom said it's bcs it's canned.  

So this place received an A for inspection which is cool since they have an open kitchen and was preparing food right in front of us but the smell of sewage was gross.  I mean I know it's not their fault for a bad building foundation and drainage but if you are going to dine in, try and sit by the front.  

The waitress didn't bring any water or tea so you'll just have to make sure you ask for it. 

They had Chinese news playing on the TV screen.

All in all it was an ok meal.  I think if they gave a little more in portions it would be worth the meal.  My mom is still gripping about the price today haha",3

Nothing on the ground floor interested us so we went up and saw Spicy City. It was pretty empty inside, only about 2 tables filled but the owner of the restaurant, a very friendly and jolly man, popped his head out and says ""please! come try out the food! it's amazing, my wife cooks it!"" 

This man did not lie. We had 4 dishes to share with a big pot of rice and soup. Everything was delicious, and this family owned business really hit the spot for my rice craving family.

They seat you, take your order at the table, and serve you instead of having you counter order like a lot of the strip mall quick order Chinese joints.  Because of this I was surprised that our food came out in Styrofoam boxes and bowls with plastic utensils.  

The soup that comes with the lunch specials is egg drop.  It is basically favorless, but adding some of their wide crunchy wontons and hot mustard helped a little.  The crunchy wontons themselves were very good.  Light, crispy, and not greasy.  The hot mustard was was in the little to go packets.

I ordered the Sweet & Sour chicken lunch special with all white meat chicken (for an extra $1).  It came with fried rice and chow mein.  The chicken was fantastic.  They only put a little s&s sauce on top so the breading retained that crunch that gets lost when it gets doused in sauce.  The peppers and pineapple were also crisp and flavorful.  The chow main & rice were bland and nothing special.

My friend ordered the orange chicken, also all white meat.  Hers was smothered in orange sauce, so it was a little soggy.  The steam in those closed Styrofoam boxes really don't help matters.  Her orange sauce lacked much flavor.  She would not order it again.

They do have Thai tea and Boba smoothies, which are worth investigating if I ever return.

All in all, it's okay if you're looking for something cheap and quick and the service was good, but most items we tried lacked flavor.  The crispy wonton strips and sweet and sour chicken (white) would be the only things I tried that I would want to eat here again.",3

This is going to be one of the better dining places at the Palms. We went during their soft opening and went all out. We came in for our reservation on time and we immediately walked over to our table. We were asked for our drinks orders and given a menu to take a look at their options. We decided to do it family style and EAT ALL THE THINGS!! 

We started with some appetizers. First my plus one order egg drop soup, her fav thing besides rice. Next we ordered the potstickers, they came 6 to a plate. We were then offered the Green Bean Jelly as well as the Garlic Cucumber dish. Each item came out one after the other.. The next more delicious than the last. My favorite app was the potstickers. They were hot and delicious, but I had to save room for the rest of the delicious food. After we almost filled ourselves with apps, our main dishes started coming out. First we got the fried rice we order. We decided on the the pork and chicken combination. The rice was hot and flavorful. The only thing I didn't like about rice was the Chinese onions. I'm not a huge fan of onions, and if i can see them I just pick them out. Otherwise is complemented the other dishes perfectly. Next we received the Mongolian beef. This was my favorite dish. It wasn't tuff and it almost melted in my mouth. Next was the Tony's Chicken with Three Chili. I was super excited to try this dish. It was spicy and chicken and i love both of those things. I had at first chosen the chef special dry chili chicken but was recommended to get Tony's. Now, I like spicy food and my plus one doesn't. After taking a few bites I told her to try it. It wasn't spicy at all, it did have chilis in it but the actual chicken wasn't spicy. I was the most disappointed by that. I even told the waiter I loved spicy food. We move on. 

The service was why this remained at 4 stars. Our waiter was helpful and funny. He walked us through the menu and made some killer decisions when it came to the appetizers. He also placed our napkins in our laps and even filled our plates when the food came out. YUM. We ended up needing like 3 boxes for leftovers. My last negative was the food temputure. I felt like it could have been hotter on the chicken and beef. I mean it tasted fresh but I'm not sure why is wasn't a hot plate. Otherwise, this might be my new lunch spot when I'm feeling some chicken and pork fried rice.",4
1561218,vz9qVx_PWNFgenQrZWivyw,gPW4_y2jomYXZ-38SXRO9w,"Date & I planned to eat at the restaurant, but found out it wouldn't be open for a week. We just happened upon an invite only preview taste and greet. The GM was gracious in allowing us to enter. The food is good, decor with back splashes of gold, hints of Asian decor. The food...was cooked in mass so it's ok. I'm sure it will be better for individual plates. We'll try when it's open and FAR less crowded. Oh, love the waitstaff, for tonight, we'll see.",4
1561219,Ww8AnY6rAzOAFCYJYG2L6g,gPW4_y2jomYXZ-38SXRO9w,"Have you ever watched MasterChef/Hell's Kitchen and wondered....what is it like being those diners who sit and wait for 1.5+ hrs for their food???

Well, my party and I had THAT experience tonight at Lao Sze Chuan. It was opening night for them, and I guess it was busy and kitchen didn't know how to handle it? We waited almost 2 hours for our food to come to the table. After sitting for 1 hour and 20 mins, we approached the manager to ask about why our food hadn't come, and let them know that we were going to leave. We had made a reservation at 7pm, and at that point, it was 8:25pm, and all we had on our table was water/drinks and the house special spicy cabbage. WE WERE SO HUNGRY!!!

But I will say that management was very professional, and offered to comp us our meal, and invited us to come again. We finally started getting our food close to 9pm, and if you like spicy sze chuan food, it is really quite good. The flavor is there, and the ingredients are of good quality. They just gotta get their kitchen in check. And figure out which tables to bring the food to (yes, at one point, food was brought to our table and then taken away because it was supposed to be for another table! sadness....)

Decor is lovely. Chairs are super comfy.  And definitely order the dry chili chicken :)",2
1561220,4DbQNe1D2WfH_JjEgleTLQ,gPW4_y2jomYXZ-38SXRO9w,"Tradition. 
Comfort.
Value.

These words best describe our dining experience at Lao Sze Chuan on opening night. The value here was surprising! Every dish we sampled was priced very reasonably, if not competitive. The dishes we tried were served in the perfect sized portions to share between 2-4. My boyfriend and I actually took home 2 bags of leftovers by the end of the evening. 

Right away, I immediately noted the modest presentation and culinary style of master chef Tony Hu. It's a breath of fresh air to not be confronted with nibbles of expensive, weak and flavorless rabbit food. It's also important for me to note that the chef is not reinventing the wheel, he's just putting his spin on classical Szechuan dishes - fine tuning it to his culinary expertise.

We received top-notch service from start to finish. Every member of their well trained staff made us feel extra cared for. We were curious about one of the dishes we tried and one server took his time to explain to us, in detail, about the Szechuan chili and how different chilies cause different effects to the palate. He was articulate and eager to share his knowledge of the cuisine. 

I'll also quickly note that the ambiance was classy and blanketed in a swanky, modern pan asian decor - but that's what we all come to expect from a Vegas casino restaurant. Let me just put this out there - dress code is not strictly enforced. 


Here's what we tried:

//Cold spicy cabbage// complimentary 
The cold, crisp cabbage had a medium spice that tickled our nostrils and tastebuds. We enjoyed the spicy, slightly sweet and addicting crunchy texture so much that we immediately ordered a second round. *pro tip: as addicting as they are, wait to eat them with your dinner! This paired very well with the rice and the rest of our dishes. 5/5

//Chongquin chili oil wontons// (6 wontons) $5.95
We savored the expert layering of sweet, spicy flavor and also admired the striking ginger flavor infused into the chili oil. The Szechuan chili peppers pleasantly tingled and numbed my entire mouth, making it such a unique dining sensation. I only had 2 minor annoyances: the wonton wrappers were not as luscious and soft as I would prefer; they were actually hard and a bit undercooked. The same could be said about the wonton filling; a little lackluster and dry. However, the winning aspect of the entire dish was the sensational and flavorful numbing chili oil sauce. *pro tip: make sure to save the remaining chili oil and pour it over your rice! 4/5

//Sliced tender cold pork marinated in garlic sauce and chili oil// $6.95
This dish was presented exactly how we expected - glistening ribbons of cold, thinly sliced pork. The pork ribbons were buttery soft and marinated in a mouthwatering garlicky chili oil flavor - but the dish is not at all oily. Keep in mind, this dish is not saucy and had mild spice. 5/5

//Lamb with pure cumin// $15.95
A dry (not saucy), stir-fried dish with a gorgeous deep brown color, red and green bell peppers, whole Szechuan chili peppers (not spicy in the slightest, but great smoky flavor), jalapeño slices (not spicy at all), garlic, and onion. Pure cumin is the precise way to describe the overall flavor of this dish. The lamb was generously coated in the warm cumin spice and was extremely bold and aromatic. However I can't emphasize it enough, this dish was lacking spiciness altogether. Also, I personally thought the lamb was a bit too chewy and tough, yet my boyfriend felt that the lamb was expertly prepared and was as tender as it will ever be - two different preferences and views on an arguably tasty dish. In the end, this fact remains - the lovely cumin spice complimented the gamey nature of the lamb very well. 4/5
*edit: just had the most divine (leftover) lunch! The lamb marinated even longer with the intense, flavorful cumin seasonings, making it 100% more tender and flavorful. These are a solid 5/5 now! 

//Eggplant in garlic sauce// $11.95 
A traditional dish with familiar flavors. However, it was a sultry celebration of a classic dish, namely because they selected the most perfectly ripe, plump eggplants and gently cooked them in effort to retain their lovely firm texture and to keep their beautiful shape. They were insanely juicy, sweet and buttery. Also, the sauce was super silky, swimming with an abundance of wood ear mushrooms and crisp pickled cucumber. I couldn't stop eating it, even well after I claimed I was full. 5/5

All minor issues aside, my boyfriend and I absolutely enjoyed our dining experience here; our dinner was satisfying and comforting. We are looking forward to returning soon, in hopes that the small setbacks we encountered were just a case of the opening day jitters. 

I applaud master chef Tony Hu and his World-class staff and wish them continued success.

Wife and I were there just after 11 so before lunch crowd and food was a while in coming after order placed. Second, we were there for dim sum and there is limited availability at this time, and no visual reference for beginners. With that out of the way the shumai and guazu were very well done, and were especially tasty with requested hot sauces. Tried the pumpkin congee and found it lacking in much flavor. Also tried two noodle dishes and found them well done, with distinct flavors and ample size. Ambience is very classy and all staff were very helpful, but overall might be some opening stutters that might be addressed at next visit (which will definitely occur).",3

After we ordered we waited for like 30 mins to get our first hot dish, and then someone told us that they ran out of fish and cabbage so we needed to changed our other order...

The food was salty and overcooked. I believe I can do better than that. Just don't go.",1

I have to say the Szechuan Smoked Tea Duck (with Bone) was fabulous as well as the Sole Fish Fillet with Black Bean Sauce...it was to die for.

But the real star of the evening was our server...Rachel...she was spectacular!!!  We will most certainly be here again.,5

The best Chinese restaurant in Vegas! 

We've been to Lao Sze Chuan in Chicago and it was great. We were so excited to find out there's a Lao Sze Chuan located in Palms Casino in Vegas. The food was very delicious and the service was above and beyond. Moreover, price was really reasonable. Definitely will come every time we are in town.",5
1561226,KMdPVEYYI3TAGwUSILUrvw,gPW4_y2jomYXZ-38SXRO9w,"AS YOU PLEASE

We just could not resist trying this new Chinese restautrant that had just opened at the Palms September 12th seven days before Jack Ma's Alibaba IPO that became the largest in US history.  Customary,  we do not attend a new opening. Always allowing management time to iron out operational kinks. Cleverly the front area receptionists are honest to walk ups and explain the reality and concern of service with timely kitchen production. After all the first impression is the most important.

We waited just twenty minutes before being called on our cell phone that our table was waiting for us.  During that stagnant time, we noticed the obvious theme of the slot games being Far Eastern.  

Well, from the moment we were escorted to out table, we were constantly being monitored by several table attendants and of course our server who spoke English,  Mandarin and Cantonese. 

Menu is written in both English and Chinese with certain dishes offered in specific cooking style such as Szechuan, Hunan, Chongqin, Mandarin and Shandong. Specific dishes may have options for either Szechuan or Hunan style. Vegetarians will be happy to see many selections designated by green marks. We're spicy eaters but not so much Chongqin spiciness. So as a heads up warning, two red chili pepper designation are only for the chili pros. Majority of diners can't tolerate spicy, so dishes may be ordered non-spicy. Essentially, the menu will please both the Westerner and overseas born ethnic Chinese.

We decided on ""House Special Beef Brisket with Beer in Pot"" (411), ""Famous Dong-Po Steamed Pork Elbow (with bone)"" (458) and rounding out the three meats , "" Chef's Special Dry Chili Chicken "" (501). All three but (501) single chili designations. Yet each having a distinguished flavor of either sweetness, vinagerrite-ness and of course seasoning. It's not where the chili overpowers the intended flavor of the meats.

The beef brisket will even taste better the second day. Fatty pork elbow reminds Yu-go of his favorite Cuban dish lechon. Chicken was both our favorite dish...maybe so since there was no sauce. Rice is fluffy fresh.

Two entrees will easily satisfy two diners. We took more than half our dinner home. The glitches of a new restaurant is sometimes unavoidable. I'm more than sure that the Palms and restaurant management read the negative comments about service and uncalled for long waiting. Tonight's performance was flawless. As for the cuisine, we're planning on returning for three more dishes.

Those who are from or have visited Chicago's old Chinatown will recognize this restaurant name. They're one and the same.

Second or third most important,  prices are to draw the locals and the very price conscious Asians. Can't ask for more. Great dining venue at affordable prices.",5

If you are looking for a nice atmosphere and a beautiful place to eat Chinese food, this is the place. I can only imagine how many peppers this place goes through in one day.

Honey Garlic Pepper Beef Tenderloin

We headed over the try the new Chinese restaurant at the Palms after hearing about their opening promotion. (Go to the hostess stand - there are 25% off dining cards available until October 15/14). We tried dinner twice to sample a variety of dishes while the promotion is going on.

FYI - we decided to skip the $1 white rice and opted for the noodle soup and green onion pancake instead. I decided not to order the sketchy fried rice (in the Yelp pics, there is definitely soy sauce and carrots = gross) which cater to the lemon chicken crowd. I guess ""Asian-fusion"" = Americanized here.

Shandong beef noodle soup: this was a decent bowl of beef brisket soup - it tasted more like chu hou braised brisket beef noodle soup than your clear consomme beef noodle soup. My hubs is Taiwanese so it was a little different than what he is used to but he enjoyed it. Overall, it went well with the spicy food we ordered. The noodles were slightly thicker and round and had a nice bite to it. 

House tofu: a disappointing dish of fried tofu and nappa cabbage. Not enough wok-hai (heat from the wok), left the dish overly soggy with limp vegetables. The cornstarch they added in the end in an attempt to save the dish made it even more sloppy. They might have added some vinegar to the dish, resulting in an unpleasant sour taste. Not a fan.

Stir-fried green beans: (11.95) we requested the Szechuan style which was non-spicy however were accidentally provided with the spicy version of the dish. This mistake was promptly noticed by our server who replaced it with the right version. The small sample we had of the spicy version was okay - the green beans were stir-fried with cumin and whole/crushed chilis. The Szechuan style green beans were good - stirfried with some preserved vegetables. Again, portion sizes are small for the price.

Stir-fried large pea pod leaves: (13.95) generally well executed. We ordered this dish twice and each time the leaves were appropriately prepped (meaning they discarded the fibrous portion of the plant). My only beef is that for the price, the portion size is much smaller than expected.

Smoked Tea Duck: (15.95):This dish was quite good - loved the mild smokiness of the duck. They kindly debone the breast of the duck for you so it is easier to eat. That being said, for $15, the portion size is small.

Green Onion Pancake: cannot recommend this. The pancake was tough, greasy, dense and overly bland. Avoid.

Szechuan Peppercorn Fish: (15.95) the batter was overly thick/heavy for the fish. It was also not crispy enough. I'd pass on this dish.

Given the fact that I would probably not order half of the dishes again and the food is definitely overpriced given the quantity/quality, I do not feel a huge urge to return even with the 25% discount. I'd like to mention that they do offer a small dim sum menu which I have not tried. Although that being said, dim sum is a Cantonese (not Szechuan) style of cuisine so you have been warned. 3 starred review.",3

1561233,gp9ZTF_ZmqX_ZraZzuG1NA,gPW4_y2jomYXZ-38SXRO9w,"This is my first time giving 5 stars to a Chinese restaurant in Vegas.

My wife and I are into all kinds of Asian food - except, somehow, Chinese. It wasn't like that before. We definitely had been a Chinese food lover when in Hong Kong / Taiwan / Japan, but when we moved to the US, first to the San Francisco Bay Area, things changed. We found quite a few nice Chinese restaurants including Yank Sing in SF, Tai Pan in Palo Alto, Little Sichuan in San Mateo and Hunan Home's in Mountain View. But the number is disproportionately small compared to other Asian cuisine. We've tried many, and been disappointed more often than not. At the end of the day, we developed the unconscious habit to avoid Chinese restaurants.

The situation got worse after moving to Vegas. We tried many, and those attempts ended up futile.

So when we heard about Lao Sze Chuan, we didn't have a high hope - but this place turned out to be a great surprise!

- Tony's chili chicken
- Crispy shrimp with lemon sauce
- Don don noodle
- Dim sum: Shu mai
- Pork & rgg congee

Everything was tasty, and the portion was perfect for sampling with two people. I expected spicy food for being Sichuan, but for instance the don don noodle had just right amount of spiciness.

The best part? Reasonable pricing. In fact it's more than reasonable considering it's in the Palms Casino Resort.

Thank you Tony Hu, we finally found a place to return to.",5

Don don noodles- my favorite dish of the night even though it was overly salted 

Spicy beef tendon- full of oil

Reserved this place for 3 at 7pm to avoid any waiting. Ended up waiting for about 15 minutes before being escorted over to our table. Given--- dinner on a Saturday night was not even busy and the place was not packed.

It took 30 minutes for them to take our order and add along another 1.5 hours just to bring us all our food. Can you believe most of our time spent in this restaurant was just waiting on food-waiter-rice-water-order-bill. 

Garlic Cucumber:
You can never go wrong with a cold dish of garlic cucumber. Refreshing. Light. But delicious. This is my must order appetizer when it is available at any chinese restaurant I eat at.

Boiled Sole Fish Fillet:
Surprisingly this was not very spicy considering it IS Szechuan food... But! It wasnt overwhelmingly oily. Very delicious. Made me think of homemade chinese food I hadnt had in a long time.

Sliced Tender Pork with Garlic Sauce:
It was tender but some pieces were a bit dry. It obviously had no impact on me considering I cant recall if it was good or not. Our waiter actually messed up our order and put in Chicken instead of pork so this dish took even longer to be served to us.

Fried Shrimp:
$16 bucks for this recommended dish from our waiter. Tasted very delicious like a high class honey walnut shrimp dish minus the walnuts. Not too much sauce on the shrimp but it did have a light crunch to it. Delicious but $16 bucks is a lot for this dish lol.",3
1561240,u7pxrxJLVRJSBXaKUm-pnQ,gPW4_y2jomYXZ-38SXRO9w,"I've been meaning to try this restaurant for the longest time. I love Chinese food, and this restaurant has been raved about it. 

There's nothing special about the restaurant. I have nothing to rave about or say that it tastes super amazing. It's normal Chinese food- nothing spectacular. I went with a group of a total of 6 people. Now since we had a lot of people, we ordered a ton of food. Now, on it's own, each dish was not terribly spicy. With the combined dishes, the food was spicy! 

Before we ordered, they served a complimentary spicy cabbage (raddish) dish. We ordered, shang hai dumplings, cold rabbit dish, hot and sour seafood soup, lamb with cumin, mapo tofu, string beans, szechuan pepercorn fish, chicken with a spicy garlic sauce, and  a shortrib dish. 

The rabbit dish had a large amount of peanuts, and the dish was rather small. It was suppose to be a cold dish, but it was more lukewarm. I think they brought us the wrong soup because it wasn't hot and sour at all. But we drank the soup already, so what can be done. The shanghai dumplings were in a mini pie tin. It was annoying to take them out of the tin. The spicy garlic chicken was delicious. The mapo tofu wasn't the same flavor that I was used to, but I liked it. It was really spicy and the tofu was so soft that it melted in my mouth. They didn't have any pork in it. 

They took forever to bring out food out. It literally took at least 30-40 minutes before they brought out the first dish. What's strange, though, is that they waited to bring everything out all at once. They brought all the dishes, and there wasn't any room on the table. Isn't it typical to bring out each dish as it's ready. And isn't it typical to bring the soup at way earlier? As a result, some of our dishes weren't as hot as they could be. The food was all okay. There wasn't anything special like this is the best Chinese restaurant in Las Vegas or anything. 

They did put auto gratuity on our tab, but it's expected as the party did have 6 people.",3
1561241,bqvhUzguQCs4WHc65J10sw,gPW4_y2jomYXZ-38SXRO9w,"We went there for dinner. It is good that they close at midnight as a lot of time we have dinner after 10pm but don't wanna eat in China Town. We like the environment of the restaurant, the food, and the service. The price is acceptable, cheaper than the Chinese restaurants in other hotels on the strip. 

We ordered a Mongolian beef, beef fried noodle and sauteed baby bak choy. They all tasted great. The Mongolian beef is really better than any other Mongolian beef I had tasted else where. The seasoning profile of this one has more depth than those using too much black pepper, garlic and soya sauce. The Mongolian beef here is really outstanding, it tasted so good without having anything overpowering, well balanced.

The sauteed baby bak choy is well done, the veggie is just right, not under or overcooked. It is not garlicy as we asked for simple sauteed, so it is simply refreshing. The baby bak  choy is fresh, and good quality, they are well cleaned too so no sandy taste when chewing on them. They smartly cut the baby bak  choy into quarters vertically so they could be thoroughly cleaned.

The beef fried noodle is good, just no surprise, which is expected. I like that they don't use the very thin yellow noodle. 

We were offered a small complimentary spicy veggie plate as appetizer. It smelled really good but too spicy for us that we kept coughing. If you can handle picy, you will like it. 

I like Chinese food having the real Chinese flavor, meaning that I always compared it with what I had tasted when I was in northern China for an exchange program. I like food having depth but not overpowering by only black pepper or garlic That means I don't like americanized Chinese food. So far, with the 3 dishes that I tried, they tasted Chinese without Americanization. There was also no MSG. I hate MSG. I always think that only those chefs who can't cook well need to use MSG. So big kudo for here not using any. I hope they won't change on this aspect in the future. I can't speak for other dishes yet, but will update in the future after I tried something new there. 
We finished everything we ordered and had a happily filled stomachs at the end. We will come back to try other dishes for sure!",4

The decor is top notch; it's easily the nicest szechuan restaurant I've ever been to.  It's a great place for a date if you don't mind getting sweaty together before all the action starts.

The food itself is definitely authentic szechuan food, with real peppercorns and szechuan peppercorn oil in the dishes.  The dishes are decent, and are good enough to satisfy any szechuan cravings.  A-Ok on most everything; some were a lil above average, some were slightly below. I tried a bunch of the authentic dishes; from tony's chicken with 3-chili to boiled beef tenderloin in spicy szechuan sauce to the dan dan noodles.  

Your craving will be satisfied, but your socks won't be blown off.  At least the prices are what you would expect to find at any other szechuan restaurant.

4.5 on decor, 3 on the food, 3 on the service = 3.5 stars, but Yelp won't let me put 3.5, and I ain't the type of dude to round up.  Better be pleasantly surprised than slightly disappointed.",3

Friendly, very helpful staff.i can not say more good about my experience. Also reasonabe prices. Beautiful presentation of every dish.large portions of food with every dish.

We were a party of 11 and had ordered about 15 entrees and about 5 appetizers. Food was served promptly and timed extremely well. The service staff constantly filled our soda and water glasses. The manager stopped by a few times to check to make sure our experience was up to par. 

The Mapo Tofu was one of the best I ever had and I had plenty in China. The General Tso chicken was among one of the favorites in our group. I can go on and on about all the dishes. However I will just say that all the entrees were a spicy foodies dream.

Pros: 5 star for food and service. Ambiance and atmosphere was great. The lighting was perfect for taking photos of the food.

The room is now more open and brighter than in the past.   A spicy cabbage salad was delivered to our table while we reviewed the menu.  We started off with shrimp spring rolls that were light and tasty.  For entrees we chose sole filets in a fresh black bean sauce plus the chef's special chili chicken.  

There was an exceptionally long delay between courses so our waitress brought us a second dish of cabbage salad and eventually comped us desserts.  The chicken dish was a crunchy delight though not nearly as spicy as one would believe given the quantity of red chili on the plate.  The sole was tender and equally delicious.  Prices are moderate for a casino restaurant and entrees are generously portioned.

Our individual cheesecakes, though hardly Asian, almost brought one senior to tears. On entering I had secured a grand opening card from the hostess that was good for 25% off menu prices through October 15th.",4

It is still decent Chinese grubs, but it just doesn't taste the same. Everything was just off. Things just tasted differently. And the portions are also much smaller at a more expensive price. 

The service was also very unfriendly, especially the old lady. Not even quiet sure if she understood English fully or not. 

I don't think I will be going back to the Vegas one ever. There are much better choices to eat than a knocked off version of the original.",3

We had about 10 ppl in our group and the reservation and everything went good all the way up till the service. My waiter probably needed to be trained again on customer service. I literally am consistently looking for him for a refill or for my orders ! There was a period where I waited over 30 mins to get an Order I had for some meat and veggies. The worst part was that I had spoke to two other ppl to check my order before my waiter came over and finally realized he lost my order !!!! After 30+ mins and no food we were starving !!!! The proportions were not good as they barely gave the bare minimum to serve everyone. I know there is limitations so that ppl do not waste food but we didn't even have enough to share ! Not to mention my waiter told literally told me ""it's troublesome for ME and for you when we do hotspot."" Um excuse me ? IM PAYING FOR THIS!!!!!!!!! Honestly there was nothing special about this place or it's food and probably the worst customer service. Oh and the manager lounges around doing practically nothing.

Most of the dishes have gone up in price. I don't think that is a smart thing to do. Anyways, it looks like I will be going there less and less now. it's a Chinese restaurant. It shouldn't have fancy steakhouse prices. Too bad.",3

The interior is nicely done and appears very upscale. The prices were very accommodating and I will definitely recommend trying out their all you can eat hot pot. At 23 dollars a person if you are a party of 2 or more this is a great deal for the price. Their hot pot menu also offers a variety of meats, seafood, and vegetables. They have three options for broth. The healthy flavor which is somewhat bland, the house special which is tasty, and another one which I don't remember off the top of my head and haven't tried yet.

I grew up on American take-out Chinese & have recently discovered the real deal, OG Chinese food & love it like 100x more than the Sweet N Sour Chicken & Lo-mein I grew up eating.

We had the two sole dishes & liked them thoroughly but preferred the black bean to the chili. The chili was way too sweet & not spicy enough. We also had the garlic pea leaves which were fantastic. 

The hot pots look awesome & we will be back to try them.

The service is what I've come so expect in Chinese restaurants, which is not bad, just different & I actually prefer this style of service to American style service.  I dont need to know my servers name, know their personality, etc...At LSC it is all about the business of getting you your drinks & food without all the small talk.

The space is impressive. Large, open but still very Vegas casino....duh, it is in the Palms.  I really liked the foyer & thought it was the best designed part of the restaurant.

I was good. We will be back but after we do more exploring at some cheaper options in Chinatown.",3

Found CHINA AAA and surprisingly they had some Japanese food you can choose from.  
I found my WON TON $5.95 but not WOR WON TON- it was ok and I don't like when the Won Ton seems to be all wrappers and not much filling.  Had lots of stuff in it such as veggies, and meat.  I got busy eating the other stuff so will have to truly rate this next time when it's fresh. 
The HOUSE FRIED RICE $7.25 was pretty good.  Lots of stuff in it, meat, shrimp, chicken, port, and not over soy-sauced.  Thumbs up.
HOUSE CHOW MEIN  $7.25  yummy.  Lots of goodies in it as far as meat and shrimp and beef...and not at all greasy like it usually is.  Thumbs up.
CRAB RANGOON  (8 Pcs) $4.95 ok/so-so.  I'd say the ones from Panda is better.  
CUCUMBER SUNOMONO SALAD= typical salad.  Not bad.  
HOUSE SPRING ROLLS 2 for $2.95....It had a surprise..not all veggies and had a big shrimp in it.  

So....for now....they got three STARS.   Not bad.  I like to try it again for second chance before they go on the GREEN list or RED list.  

They get a bonus thumbs up for DELIVERY and only cost $2.00.  That's pretty reasonable considering how much gas costs nowadays.

I should have listened to my gut (no pun intended) when it told me to stop eating.  The morning after I ate here, I felt nauseous and light-headed.  Then a few hours later, I finally threw up.  An hour or two after THAT, I threw up again.  Turns out, my entire family got sick that day.  I reported the restaurant to the Southern Nevada Health District.

Price is high of course at about $13.99 a bowl but I shared it with my friend since we were eating out a lot in Vegas.

I had the Taiwanese beef noodle soup - a classic. It was perfect. The broth was piping hot, rich, mildly spicy, and had the perfect amount of grease slick on top. Yum!!! The beef was superb and perfectly tender. Basically melted in your mouth. The noodles were perfectly cooked and stayed firm.

Quality was on par but selection is very limited here and of course the price was way higher. Taiwanese beef noodle was far from what I enjoyed in Taiwan. Fried rice? I'll pass.

I felt like we were paying for the ambiance just because it was inside the Paris hotel, The reason why i gave this place a 3 star was because the service was great, not your typical Chinese restaurant that's for sure! If only they cooked like your typical Dim Sum restaurant I would have given them a 4 star.

Dishes are all probably about 2X as expensive as they would be outside of the Vegas strip, but that just comes with the location.

I made a reservation on Open Table. When our plans changed, I tried to cancel. I could not cancel on the Open Table site, but it did give me a phone number to call Yong Kang Street directly. When I tried to do that, there was a recording that said that the mailbox was full.....""goodbye"". I didn't want this negative item on my Open Table account so the next day when we were in the area, I stopped at Yong Kang Street to talk to someone. The hostess informed me that they were not taking Open Table reservations, even when I showed her a copy of mine with the confirmation number. She also said that the system was down and she could not fix my reservation. Huh? Are they taking reservations from Open Table or not? I informed her that I tried to cancel my reservation by calling the phone number that was provided and she suggested that I discuss that with the manager. UGH!

Besides being super expensive, at eight bucks per dim sum and over 10 for a small bowl of noodles... but I spent the entire next day on and off the porcellin throne. 

And it wasn't just me -- my friend who I went to Yong Kang with had the same problem.

I reall wish it was better. But FYI... Las Vegas has a great Chinatown - with good dim sum in carts on weekends and great Cantonese BBQ & Seafood places for dinner. There is also excellent Korean in Vegas. And the Chinatown is only 10 mins from the strip.

My noodles were delicious as was the pieces of duck although I would have liked it had my pieces not been so boneheads. The pork over rice was even better it was ground pork nicely seasoned with Chinese five spice and it had sacallions tossed into it as well. 
We were also tempted by the dim sum cart that came around but we opted to just stick with what we ordered.

   My brother and I had been walking about a mile from Red Rock Resort to Sahara Avenue exploring the new star of Las Vegas : Downtown Summerlin. In the days before the restaurants open in downtown Summerlin for the Christmas season, there are a few choices as of November 4, 2014. Exploring  the southern quadrant of Downtown Summerlin where it abandons the unique pedestrian oriented streetscapes north of Dillard's for an ordinary auto oriented shopping center, my brother and I were hungry and we wanted to eat now. With Red Robin opening in a week, there were a few choices that included Five Guys and a hero place. We decided on Panda Express. 

  In Panda style, the service was good. In reality the service was better than a couple of full service restaurants I reviewed. When I say good service, I state that the employees were friendly and helpful. From ordering to paying, I was treated decently. On the other hand Verizon provided bad service. There was an issue with the Verizon signal in Panda Express and downtown Summerlin that affected my Internet experience. 

  The major flaw with Panda Express is that when an entrée is empty, it's display tray changes into an unappetizing display of tin, crumbs, and cooking oil. Some locations are more affected than others. The worst I have seen is the Pecos at Windmill Von's location. This location is moderately affected by this flaw. I would have preferred to order the egg plant if the majority of the tray wasn't cooking oil. I have always been under the impression that Panda Express corporate needs to develop a sheet or blanket to cover the tray when it is more cooking oil than entrée . Of course the panda, who in my opinion is one of the coolest fast food mascots, would adorn the cover sheet or blanket. 

  Fortunately a fair amount of the entrées were presented nicely. I ordered a two entrée combo with string beans and chicken, sesame chicken, fried rice, and chow mein. I appreciate Panda's noodle based chow mein more than some of the local Chinese restaurants in Vegas that include China Go Go. Panda's chili sauce added a burst of flavor to the chicken. With a medium Pepsi beverage, Panda was kind of worth $10 and change. 

  What are my chances of returning to the downtown Panda?

    Regardless that Panda Express is good fast food, I doubt I will be returning to this location soon. I am optimistic that several restaurants will be opening in Downtown Summerlin by Christmas. Before or if  I return to this  Panda Express, I would have tried a couple of Downtown Summerlin's restaurants. And Red Robin is on the cue of restaurants that I intend to dine in and Yelp. For now, I department from the Downtown Summerlin Panda with three stars.",3

But it reopened as the Vegas Buffet and after a few months, I got curious. So I had lunch there today. It is an acceptable Asian Buffet, much like Krazy Buffet and Buffet of Asia. What will bring me back here are the cucumber salad, the potato salad, and the banana bread pudding. The cucumber salad was tasty, but not too tart. The potato salad was simple with nice big chunks of potato and just enough dill sauce. And the banana pudding had small chunks of crunchy bread and a dollop of whipped cream--yummy!",3

They added the meat before bringing it out to us, so the steak was closer to medium by the time we started eating it. However, this did not bother us at all once we tried the broth!

Yes, driving to Spring Mountain was very inconvenient but there really wasn't any other choice for good Vietnamese food nearby. I'm glad to say I can now get my pho fix in North Vegas. And there's one thing you should know about me, I am a Pho snob. So I wasn't expecting it to be as good as my beloved Pho Saigon but what a pleasant surprise for me that it's a very close second. So delicious and not to mention kid approved. 

The restaurant itself is very clean, equipped with flat screens which are usually set to the food network. The portions could be a tad bigger but the prices are fair and the staff is very friendly. They will refill your drinks before you happen to notice your glass is half empty (or half full if your the optimistic type). And I also like how they come by periodically to remove empty plates, you don't usually see this type of service at other Vietnamese restaurants. 

They definitely have the right idea and will stand out from the bunch. Making sure customers are happy is the best way to ensure they will be back and often. Case and point, the restaurant just opened in November and I've been back twice and that is only the beginning. 4 solid stars. ; ) PhoLife.",4

To their defense, I probably just ordered the wrong thing. I got the Thai Curry because I've been craving it for a while and I was surprised to see that they had it there, and for really inexpensive too (about $6), but when it came out it tasted so bland. There was almost no flavor to it and absolutely no spice. The best way I could describe it to my boyfriend was, its like when you're sick and your tastebuds can't taste anything.
And to make matters worse, the lady totally forgot to give me my Thai Milk Tea that I ordered lol.
My boyfriend, on the other hand, loved his food. He ordered the charbroiled pork chop and a side of egg rolls. The only negative thing he could say about it was the portion size was super small compared to other pho places like Pho So 1, Pho Kim Long, Pho Mailan etc.
If it weren't for how clean the restaurant aS and how welcoming and attentive the staff was, I'd probably give this review lower than 3 stars.

The broth was very tasty. And as you know, this is everything for Pho. 
The beef was nice and sliced very thin and the shrimp was cooked but tasted fresh. 
There isn't much else I can say because Pho is good or Pho is bad. 

Ready to go back and try out some of the other dishes they have. Especially for the prices they charge. It was only $15 for two large portions of Pho.",4

We had pot stickers, shrimp rolls, rare beef Pho, & pork/shrimp & egg roll w/ vermicelli.

Food - The combination pho was pretty good. I ordered the pork eggrolls as well, which was okay to say the least, it tasted premade. My biggest complaint however, was the thai tea.. Most of my drink was nothing, but ice! A few sips of it and you're pretty much done! I wouldn't order it again, not for three bucks..

Service - Not sure why, but it felt like I didn't get that good of a service? There were empty booths, but I was seated in the middle of the place. The empty dishes were not taken away and my water wasn't refilled? Everyone else around us had pretty good service and had their stuff taken away and water refilled.. Not sure what was going on, but my bf and I were pretty quiet, we didnt even make a ruckus or a complaint so I don't get why we were excluded? The only time we were noticed is when our food was brought to us and the bill. OH and did I mention the workers were arguing about a money shortage? Yeah, that should not be done out in the open for your customers to overhear.

Will I be back? Maybe.",3

So I ordered the charbroiled pork and Shrimp over a bed of vermicelli and some Veggies. The pork was charbroiled to perfection,  the flavors were marvelous and the vermicelli texture was perfect. 

Woman can live on pho alone,  the varieties of pho from beef, chicken Shrimp and plain veggie are always available here.  But the other non pho choices are awesome.  Don't miss trying the veggie egg rolls.",5

1567513,Adp9Tt6WXYnLEvp2kaEusQ,_Ec1KaH6DpX-1NNE8fA55Q,"Looking for a place to eat and found this new Pho restaurant on Yelp literally across the road from where we were. It's kind of strange to see ANY pho in this part of town but it had very good reviews so that was reason enough to try it out. 

If you know where the Roberto's on North Rancho is (and if you're local and you don't know then shame on you) then you can find this place as it is in the same strip mall right between a State Farm and a sex shop. Only in Las Vegas. This place has been open less than two months and it looks like it. Everything is very new and clean. You can still smell the paint a little bit.

Service was great but then again we got there right after they opened and we were the first customers. Everything on the menu is surprisingly cheap. Most things were under $8 which is great. The menu is, for lack of a better word, a bit safer looking than most of the places in Chinatown. Most things had some variety of beef or pork in them and about the most unusual thing on the menu was tripe. Basically, being a boring white person, I did not have to guess at what anything was. I get the feeling that they are geared toward the less adventurous diners.  

We got the shrimp pan fried noodles, the pork egg rolls and the B1 pho special which has a little bit of everything in it. Currently, Pho Saigon 8 on Spring Mountain is my favorite pho place in town. I wouldn't say that the pho or the egg rolls at Pho Rancho were quite as good as Pho Saigon 8 but I enjoyed them all the same. My girlfriend loved the pan fried noodles. 

Overall this place is pretty good and I hope they are successful. I know we will be back to try some other things since it all looked good.",4
1567514,TwRU99cgOqg0m0JcWtkahQ,_Ec1KaH6DpX-1NNE8fA55Q,Just ate here (take out) and I had the pad tai and PHÒ.... The restaurant was bright and u could tell it was new it was very cute. Service was very very friendly and prompt. Pad tai was excellent everything I expected and I tried my friends beef which was also great... I mainly went there to get phò because we don't have any PHÒ on the NW side and I was sick so phò was exactly what I needed... Boy oh boy was I disappointed!!! After reading all the reviews I was excited but when I opened the container to the broth it didn't smell like it usually smells so I sipped it and it tasted sweet and a little thick disgusting!!! It was also dark brown even though I ordered chicken phò... I gave it the benefit of the doubt and added the noodles and spices and chicken like I like and tried it again but I couldn't bare the smell and taste... Instead I drained the juice and just ate the noodles... Would have given this place 5 stars if it wasn't for the terrible phò... Maybe i went on a bad day?,3

i have eaten pho at many places on spring mtn and around las vegas nothing to write home about folks i never finished it all, that is until i came to this Marvelous place.
The Pho is outstanding to say the least i can never have enough the place is very clean and the staff is nice but the food man oh man i cant wait to go there again and again :)",5

1567519,-8AbQlEo_sw4vpP4ct4fqA,_Ec1KaH6DpX-1NNE8fA55Q,"North Las Vegas is stepping it up with a few new restaurants and this is one worth writing about.  There are really NO legit pho restaurants in North Las Vegas, so I would say this a great addition to the area.  The next closest spot would be Viet Bistro but even that is a little further away.

So onto the food, we tried the pork egg rolls, combo pho, and charbroiled pork vermicelli bowl.  The pork egg rolls are definitely not as good as Viet Bistro, but a whole lot cheaper.  You really can't beat 4 large eggrolls for $4.95.  They weren't my favorite due to a strange salty/sour flavor.  I'll probably give them one more go, in hopes that it was an off batch.  The combo pho really hit the spot for me...it had rare steak/meatballs/tendon/tripe...all the good stuff.  The flavor of the broth is a tad bit on the sweet side but still very savory.  For $8 a bowl, the price is definitely right for the quantity.  The charbroiled pork vermicelli bowl was very tasty, but a little skimpy on the pork in my opinion compared to other locations.  Also,  I wish they offered chicken as an option instead of just beef and pork.   And where is my favorite bun bo hue....that would really make this place legit...but prob scare the non-Asian folks in this area.

Based on my observations of the staff, they are Cantonese and Vietnamese (since they speak both languages).  They also have some other Asian offerings (like stir fried noodles, curry, pad thai)....not sure if I'll venture into ordering non-Viet or Cantonese items offered.  The restaurant is fairly large and clean...for now.  Good fro groups and they were showing football games on Sunday.  Definitely will be back for a nice hot bowl of pho in the wintertime!  Hope they last in this location, it's a needed addition to the restaurants up North.",4

If you're in North Las Vegas like I am, this spot is very convenient since you don't have to go all the way to Spring Mountain just to get some good Vietnamese food.

Pho Rancho is very clean and the service was excellent. Our waiter was very attentive and made sure everything was in order. The pho was very hearty. I don't think I've been to a pho restaurant that was generous in their slices of beef. Broth wasn't overpowering or bland at all. I'm pretty sure if Goldilocks ate here she would agree the pho was just right. My father also ordered the grilled beef with rice, which I have to say was very good. If you're familiar with Filipino cuisine it tasted like tocino, but beef. The ground pork eggrolls were fantastic as well.

But the one thing that will definitely keep me going are the prices. I don't think you can beat their price for the damn good quality taste they have. From comparison, I would say they're about $2-$3 cheaper than your average Vietnamese restaurant. 

Would definitely recommend.",5

Came Tuesday for lunch, first impression is that it's nice and clean which is always a great sign. Our server is nice and helpful, brought our tea out quickly, very tasty. 

We ordered the spring rolls and combo pho. The spring rolls were awesome! All the ingredients were extremely fresh, peanut sauce was just right. The pho came out soon after that very hot which is just how we like it because we always get the steak on the side. Everything was well sliced, nothing was really coarse or carelessly made. Only thing is the soup could be more flavorful. Overall it was a surprising great experience and we will be back for more :)",4

1568512,Yx0ERIqsOBqvmhMb9JEXKg,lMXAodHdwDSZpXScds0Qag,"For a quick simple sushi lunch, this is a good place to go in this area. They have a lunch menu that includes katsus, teriyaki, tempuras, and simple standard rolls such as spicy tuna. All lunch dishes come with a side salad with ginger dressing and miso soup. Their regular menu has a variety of nigiris, sashimis, special rolls, and some Chinese and Korean influenced dishes such as honey walnut shrimp and kimchi noodle soup. They also have different types of soups and curries. The lunch menu is reasonably priced, 1 dish around $8-9 average. The service was good and it's clean and spacious. Going in I didn't expect much, but overall it was a good visit. I especially enjoyed my salmon skin handroll. The sushi rice is seasoned well and they are portioned well as in they don't over do it on the rice to save the goods. They give a generous portion of fish. The freshness was ok, good enough to eat. One thing I dislike is that they serve tap water... boo. Overall I am happy this place opened. Now I have my go to Sushi place near work when I don't know what to eat for lunch.  Oh, they also have bobas!",4

The inside was big and spacious, well lit and decorated nicely. We were seated right away at a booth. The lunch special menu was very reasonably priced. I got the two-roll special which came with miso soup and salad. A full salmon roll and teriyaki chicken roll for only $8.50? Yes please! In all we ordered the fried eggplant, duck, crispy chicken, honey glazed wings, and Singapore noodles, all of which were quick to come out, but also very delicious. I especially loved the fried eggplant because it was seasoned perfectly and just slightly crispy on the outside and cut into manageable wedges. They tasted like french fries but better because it's healthier! What was also great about this place was our waitress was very courteous and attentive to our needs, she even took all the dishes we wanted to-go to the back and packaged them up for us. I had no complaints, so really the only reason I held back from giving five stars was that my tastebuds weren't completely blown away, and to be honest there aren't many places that have done that for me. Don't get me wrong though, this was still a very satisfying meal and I'd gladly come back to try some more sushi!",4
1568714,0QM2yvHp44DYeotSxDk5ng,qlbwd2A2E6PMpL2sK2TxAA,"Not all that long ago this restaurant used to be called Hot Feel, but it shuttered its doors after not even a year in business serving delicious lamb skewers and spicy boiled crawfish.  So when I heard my friend said that there is a new restaurant there with a logo of a lady as part of the signage, my first thought was that it could be China Mama's second location.  But obviously that's not the correct guess.  

Liang's Kitchen 梁媽媽家 (literal translation is Liang Mama's House), with the logo of the founder/matriarch of the restaurant incorporated into the signage (now in her 80s), is a Taiwanese comfort food restaurant chain from California and New York.  With locations in many of the Cali cities that I have previously lived or worked at before my move to Sin City.  So it was a surprise and reality check to see some of the cities listed (Cupertino, Fremont, Milpitas).  But I have been out here a relatively long time and those locations could have opened after I had already settled here.

The interior of this Liang's Kitchen still retained the majority of the interior design concepts custom built for the previous restaurant entity. albeit with small but noticeable additions.  The inclusion and prominent display of vintage Flying Tigers* aviator jackets (very very cool and most people will likely not know anything about its history) high up on the wall with lighting to draw the attention of anyone bothering to quickly survey the restaurant.  Plus there are WWII and Vietnam War era model fighter planes delicately hung from the ceiling in sortie formation (neato!).  

* 1st American Volunteer Group of the Chinese Air Force in 1941-1942, nicknamed the Flying Tigers, was composed of pilots from the United States Army Air Corps, Navy, and Marine Corps. (Copy & Paste excerpt from Wiki)  

The menu is extensive and following recent Chinese restaurant menu design practices, especially from abroad, looks like a sales catalog with professionally shoot images of some of the menu items, with alternating pages of straight up advertising.  It looks good, but it also has one very annoying attribute or lack thereof, which is the absence of any menu prices.  [Insert comment about if you have to ask about the price, you can't afford it. -Smirk face-]  I know from the restauranteur's perspective it makes sense and saves money in the long run, since they don't have to reprint the menu or have those tacky stickers every time there is a revision to menu pricing.  There is a separate menu sheet that does have the menu items and pricing, but no pictures.  So if you have the patience for it, you can practice cross referencing the main menu with the supplemental menu and other printouts.  Happy. Happy. Joy. Joy!

Food wise, I really liked the Beef and Tendon Soup Noodle that I ordered.  It is definitely ranked in the top two on my list for this item in Las Vegas.  The noodles are the thick chewy handmade variety from Northern China. The beef tendon was cooked long enough so that it is soft and very enjoyable to eat.  The broth is flavorful without being greasy.  The Lamb skewers was good, but I thought it was a bit pricey.  Their lunch box items has a good variety of pickled vegetables and 1 entire soy sauced egg along with rice and whatever protein you selected (I ordered the Taiwanese fried port cutlet for my friend, she ate everything and liked it except for the pork - too greasy).

Service was good.  However, being a new restaurant with new staff, they are still not completely familiar with the pages and pages of menu items.  But as far as refilling drinks, being friendly, it was good.

I will definitely be back to explore more of their menu.  However, considering the dreary weather, I may not get past their noodles section until late February.

4 stars! And best of luck to the latest Taiwanese restaurant to open in Las Vegas.",4

I recognized Liang's Kitchen from the other chains I've been to.  The location can be difficult to find for the first time. The main entrance to the plaza is on spring mountain road, and it's located in the Arville Square Plaza. The restaurant sits way back in the plaza, perpendicular to most of the other stores. We ordered 4 individual dishes and an appetizer: beef noodle soup, beef tendon noodle soup, pork chop rice bento, pork chop noodle soup, and wonton in chili oil.  Everyone was happy with their order, but the only thing I'd recommend is asking the cook to separate the pork chop from the soup to prevent sogginess. The portions were decently sized (I couldn't finish my bowl of noodles), and the staff is really nice. I asked for extra small side veggies that came with some of our dishes and the staff had no problem giving us more. Overall, clean restaurant, plenty of seats, nice decor, pretty good tasting Chinese food, and well priced (our bill was around $41 sans tax).  There's plenty of other options for Chinese food around here but this is definitely a place we would come back to!",5
1568716,X1OWHCXVAd74vTWjWzFpHA,qlbwd2A2E6PMpL2sK2TxAA,"Was at dinner the other day with my friend and she mentioned how a new taiwanese place opened. She said the name was something kitchen... and it reminded me of Liang's Kitchen in San Jose when i went up there in 2011. Then she looked it up, and confirmed it was Liang's Kitchen. My face with from :o to *_* Lol ! Was so excited for the next few days (Thurs to Sun... so 3 days) to go try it out ! I remembered the location i went to was super busy, their beef noodle soup was amazing, served hot in a metal bowl. Their noodles were hand-made, varying size showing it was not machine made. Been wanting to go back since every time i go up to the Bay but never had the chance !

So it opened in Vegas... Finally a new Taiwanese place ! and its one i recognize ! w00t ! It sits on the north end of the complex, on the NE corner of Spring Mountain and Arville, replacing what used to be called Hot Feel. Minimal renovations were done after the take over of the unit with some reorganization of some tables. 

The menu and ordering paper is about the same, if not the same as other locations. Price wise, i dont remember. Came to try this place with a few friends for dinner. We had initially ordered a few things. 1 Beef Roll, 1 Green Onion Pancake, and 2 Large Beef Tendon Noodle Soup (later i realized the L/R next to the name was large and regular NOODLES, not the size of the order OOPS hahaha o well)

Beef Roll and Green onion pancake came out first

Green Onion Pancake - normal green onion pancake but fried? (is that the right term). The exterior was crispy, interior was soft and hot ! Not a fan of the fried version after a previous experience at another restaurant, but this was really good ! Especially since it was fresh and HOT ! :D i liked it 

Beef Roll - Essentially a green onion pancake wrap with braised beef, cilantro, and hoisin sauce. Not as hot as i had expected in comparison to the green onion pancake. I had ate the green onion pancake first so i thought this was going to be as hot. Overall, not bad. Not too sweet and overpowering by the sauce. Fairly nice balance. We had ordered this another time after and crispy exterior on the 2nd order was flaking off. Looked a bit ugly. XD (being called high maintenance for stating this... T_T)

Beef Tendon Noodle Soup - We had ordered 2 with large noodles. 1 came out first before the other. The first order, as large as i had remembered. Lots of noodles, in a large metal bowl. Lots of preserved veggies and stuff on top. 2nd one, not so much... Amount of noodles was probably 1/2 of the first order. Inconsistency? Maybe. Didn't matter too much since we were sharing so the noodles were fairly split anyway, so not so bad overall, but still, a bit weird to have varying amounts on the same table. Flavor wise, pretty good ! Large noodles were uneven (lol as expected of handmade) and al dente ! The noodles were actually a LOT larger and wider than i had expected (to be honest, i dont remember how it was in San Jose). In a small sharing bowl, putting like 3 strands of noodles fills it up. Thats how big the noodles were. Beef was tender. Tendon was soft. Flavor overall was nice. A little sour kick (from the preserved vegetables probably). Next time, i wanna try the regular noodles. Memory is failing me XD

Shanghai? style wonton - friend wanted to order this. Small wontons (maybe 10-15 in an order) in a seaweed soup broth Nothing too special. So recognizable amount of shrimp in the wonton (not sure if shanghai style has shrimp? HK style certainly does). Wasn't a favorite but at least we've tried it? Lol

Servers tend to speak to you in mandarin (3 out of the 5 of us spoke cantonese. 1 of the 2 mandarin speakers didnt pay attention). yeah we fail rofl. Overall, not too bad. 

Would love to come back to try other things. I believe they have lunch specials as well. Prefer to have had them open in a different location but oh well.",4
1568717,czAk-u8mXwb7yo8VD03IaA,qlbwd2A2E6PMpL2sK2TxAA,"I went to this place the other day because I love Taiwanese food. I really love beef noodle soup! It's one of my favorites. I have searched far and wide going to various restaurants. 

So, my friends and I went and ordered green onion pancake, beef noodle soup, and green onion pancake with beef. I liked the green onion pancake. It was really delicious and flakey. I did like the one from Easy Earthen in California better, but this is pretty good for Vegas. 

The beef noodle soup was amazing! I think it might just be my favorite. The beef is so tender and soft. I love the broth. It was very flavorful, and wasn't watered down. I would say this is best beef noodle soup I have ever had. 

Service was a little slow here. It might be because the set up is  little difficult to see people because of the huge walls between each booth. I guess they didn't want to spend money remodeling the place. 

The only downside is that they don't have shanghai dumplings. I was so disappointed. :(",4

Mainly came for their beef rolls and the onion pancakes. They're decent but nothing to be wowed at. 

Service was mediocre on the first visit but the second visit was just terrible, aha. Couldn't even verify correct order or not because they don't put table numbers on their order forms so there's nothing to reference to. (We had a discrepancy with something we ordered and they thought we ordered something else so we wanted order form to verify.)

Service is slow so you gotta wave your hands around to get ahold of someone. Seems to be the case whether they have a lot of customers or if we're the only ones. 

Found a piece of plastic in my soup with the seaweed. Sighs. And the seaweed soup seemed crunchy/had that sandy texture like I'm eating sand or something. My friend has already said she won't be coming back. 

Really wanted it to be better but yeah... First visit was definitely better than the second in terms of overall experience.",2

I suppose any new restaurant has to work our wrinkles, and this place has a lot of wrinkles to work out.  While the food is good, the portions are smaller than similar restaurants.  That said, the service is horrible here, even by Chinese restaurant standards.  I felt like I was back in China w the rude servers and lack of hospitality.  I suppose I will come back again to see if the service improves after being open for awhile, but for now, this place is a fail.",2

The dim sum was hot and fresh!  At one point, the cart server mentioned that the item I wanted was not hot and that she would bring me one from the kitchen.  Now that's good service!

The dim sum variety was good serving the basics plus they offered plates of roast duck, BBQ roast pork, as well as some noodle dishes.  Our table server was very attentive while I noticed that the server assistant (busser) seemed a bit ""lost.""  It was obvious that he had not worked in a restaurant before.

The management and hosts were doing their best and trying to offer the best service; it was clear that they were inexperienced, but they were doing their best.  The cashier was very slow; not quite sure why.  Our server took our check to be totaled and we waited a bit.  Finally, we went to the cashier to pay; there was a queue to pay and our check still was not tallied.

Overall, I would recommend The Jade Restaurant based on this experience.  Best wishes to The Jade Restaurant.",4

Much better when it was Cathay house restaurant. The turnip cakes and taro balls were extremely salty. Egg tart is not bad along with the tripe. Siu Mai, shrimp balls, and banh cuon were hit and miss. Service was below average. Neglected our table a lot and we had to verbally call them over. Chrysanthemum tea.",2
